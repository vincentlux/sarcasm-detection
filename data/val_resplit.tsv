1	Western sahara that's not what we call it this days ,we use the term AL MAGHRIB AL KABIR.	the western sahara
0	THE GRUMP HAVE STARTED TO MOVE!	The Grumps have went live on Twitch!
1	But they're not sick *right now*, so obviously they're healthy!	I just get so sick of the narrative that fat isn't bad. Fat people aren't bad ^(aside from regular ole' assholes who happen to be fat) but excess fat is demonstrably bad. How hard is it for these people to understand that? Although I guess most of them will plug their ears and ignore it. Maybe grab a takeaway to deal with whatever emotional pain they feel regarding it.
1	But their fee fees were hurt!	Seriously. I was initially supportive of the announcment because I thought the trash on this website would finally be taken out. You know, subreddits that truly hate minorities, advocate raping and beating women and abuse animals. Nope, the only ones that are gone are those that make fun of fat people.
1	Yeah his Madden ratings show low AWR	Maybe he doest have the awareness to know when to fair catch or know when to let the ball go?
1	The lack of lols in her answer show that it isn't.	Too harsh? A big fucking nope. You're response was in proportion to how he approached you.
1	But it's not a REAL authentic Irish pub unless you advertise your Irish Carbombs.	My brother in law built an Irish pub in his basement

1	Or Kenyan.	Well for one you have to be a born-and-raised US citizen...
0	I love Steve Blake, not sure why people hate him.	Off topic, but wasn't there a thread like this where literally every post was about Steve Blake? I can't seem to find it now :(
1	Yeah because no Saudi has American assets in our country...	"This is just fucking stupid... Saudi Arabia as a country, isn't subject to American laws, so even if they can sue, the country can just say ""nah"" and nothing will happen."
1	What a lazy, self-absorbed, son-of-a-bitch.	Seeing as I'm self-employed, I'd say myself, as he's yet to make a profit. We're both very disappointed.
1	The downvote being used for its real purpose right here.	What does KFC got to do with this? I mean, yeah its a finger but why would you lick lees face

1	But Reddit has told me Iran is a beacon of hope and peace in the region...	74 lashes and 2 months in jail in Iran for the same offense.
0	Illegal in New York	Ladies and gents, PEPPER SPRAY. Why risk your body in a confrontation when you can spray someone from a distance and most likely END the conflict right then and there? /watch?v=kpIjtVDqiIg /watch?v=xtJVbsHIj9o Every single girl on this planet should carry pepper spray.
1	Inb4 profiles	$8.99 a month, and I don't have to figure out where the hell I left off in breaking bad because the other 6 people using the account have all watched the series in its entirety. I am generally a pretty frugal person, but Netflix seems worth it to me.
1	ASK ME, HUMANS, FOR I HAVE BREASTS!	"Well I guess it was bound to happen eventually. Is there a law that states ""if you are a girl on the internet, someone will eventually ask you for a tit pic?"""
1	I swim and boat in raw sewage all the time, perfectly healthy!	I'm pretty sure everything is going to be fine. People are seriously overreacting.
1	Aches to OG when Nadeshot retires... Confirmed .....	Would you want Aches to play with Optic in the 2K? During the stream Scump brought up the idea of Aches filling in for Nade in the 2K. He was down for it but Nade seemed to shut it down. Is this the right decision by Nade or no?
1	No conspicary, everyone knows the not only does the SEC have the toughest teams, but they also have the toughest bye weeks, so clearly MSU South had a much tougher off day and thus the jump in the polls	That Mississippi State jumped Michigan State in the polls in order to get all the Bowl Eligible B1G teams into bowls. Had MSU North remained ahead of MSU South, MSU North would have gone to the Orange Bowl. This means (for some reason) that the Citrus Bowl would be out for a B1G team, thus leaving one less bowl than the number of bowl eligible B1G teams. Delaney worked with the playoff committee to move MSUs ahead of MSUn in order to get Rutgers into a bowl.
0	What Abt Gadot	I saw this movie today. Ben affleck was literally the only redeeming part of the movie. It's a 3/10 for me, ben affleck needs to go direct his own batman movie.
1	Well, that does fall under literally anything short of a 5 peat and would probably be bad enough to get the coach fired.	What if you don't make the playoffs?
1	Shady is shady, probably laughing it up in their high chairs at all the idiots throwing gems at a purposefully mislabeled spawn.	Xxl two weeks before new item isn't the same thing as mislabeling a spawn description. .

1	Ah but as the Ugandan minister would say, it is the right kind of rape!	And yet the rape of young women is apparently just fine - as the only cases that have ANY consequences are few and far between.
1	Voting against their own best interests!	Hmm. Is that why the military always votes Republican?
1	Doesn't the *R* in *ARAM* stand for *Reroll* though ?	All **Random** All Mid If after this, you still think ranked ARAM is a good idea, you are just plain stupid and oblivious to any game design concept. /thread

1	Thanks dude that was the look I was going for	Like you would take dick in the ass
1	yeah, but at least Aaron Hernandez wasn't a scumbag while doing it.	Warren Sapp is a scumbag, but Aaron Hernandez murdered multiple people.
1	It's all Tumblr's fault women don't appreciate chocolate-hazelnut seduction.	Your coworker is one kickass lady. I bet that creep is still trying the nutella line on other women and wondering why women don't know a great guy when they see one.

1	It was a fair deal for Weber	"Oh god I remember the ""Raymond+Ballard+4th"" proposal for EVERYTHING"
1	Nah you're a racist because your lived experiences mean nothing as a cishet white male shitlord *that stupid flower smiley thing*	A black guy almost rear ended me, then almost ran over a pedestrian trying to weave through traffic to catch up to me. He proceeded to call me a nigger about 20 times in a minute and threatened to beat my ass - all because he didn't understand the concept of there being TWO turn lanes and he crossed into my lane. Therefore since one black guy can't drive and then threatened me with violence and racial slurs I should want all black guys to die right? Oh wait, it's probably still my fault since I am white. Oh yeah, I'm also not an ignorant fucktard who judges whole groups of people because of one asshole.

1	Yeah but 770 comes with Daylight which is worth $89.99 according to Newegg, and they would never lie about the price of a gift.	Yeah I think its a pretty good deal, picked one up last time. Even if you don't mine like me, I think it's a good deal, according to most reviews it matches up with the gtx770 and right now it's cheaper than any gtx770 I can find.
1	Yep, 100% rational you are.	Yeah, wanting a monarchy descended from a time of warlords who believed they ruled by a divine right from God himself to continue to exist today in a time of democracy and meritocracy is the height of rationality. You're brainwashed.
0	Funny thing about this is while I know you're joking, I think you're actually right about that.	I'm sure there's an entire section on rape, bro rape parties, and roofies...

1	That's important.	Chicago Cubs World Series Celebration Ranked as 7th Largest Gathering in Human History
0	Chicago tried it for the same reasons, and it didn't work unfortunately.	I've actually been saying this for years. The North and the South are so radically different from one another that they end up being burdens on each other. The only problem is that nobody knows how something like this will be handled, and are scared away by all the risks.

1	because christians like to talk crap about many groups and issues, while atheists only talk crap about christians, they did it to keep them in check xD	there are more Christians on this site than atheists, yet the atheists got the default. makes perfect sense
1	But you can't circlejerk to that!	Did no one read the article or you guys only looking at one thing? I love all the wannabe business pros on reddit. Attendance for the hockey events was reached it's expected point but the company who expected to provide 20 events and concerts only shelled out 8. If that doesn't cover 1 million in revenue I don't know. I do understand if hockey was bigger here they would reach their quota no problem but this was not a failure on the coyotes side which budgeted for this.

1	It's fine, ethics only matter in *gaming* journalism.	The irony here is that GG's first reaction here has been to cover up and try to deny that these people were ever associated, and the only reason they're even doing *that* much is because a journalist sharply critical of them, the same sort of person the movement has been critical if not outright hostile towards, called them out on it. Pls halp, drowning in sea of irony.

0	I think he will lose NJ, NY, Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania- the election will be over before the polls close in Texas.	what? well yeah if its a very close race. Not so here. Trump will not get any black vote (but republicans don't anyway), but the elephant in the room is the latino vote. Even if Trump wins the white vote by 2/3rds (and that's being optimistic), he'll need well over 40% of the latino vote. Not happening. Trump is not going to win the electoral college. I think he won't even make it to 175.

1	Yeah and Roma in Italy is their spawn point.	I think you are mistaken. Italy is Roman. Romania is named after the Romani people. These are people that came from India; they are not Roman. There are, if I remember correctly, 4 million Romani people in Romania, which is 20% of your population. That is who you are named after, not the Latin Romans.
1	What's the Free Agent Market looking like for Batting Coaches?	What are your trade deadline thoughts? I know we have the best record in baseball, but I think we need to make some moves in order to feel better about being the best team in baseball come October.

He seemed crafty, clever, and very dangerous. Khadgar's attempts to track him down were not only counter-spelled, but also led to SEVERAL very close assassination attempts on Khadgar's life - and after all that, Gul'dan *still* had a card to play in the form of corrupting Khadgar's close ally Cordana. Plans within plans within plans, this makes him a really great villain, as opposed to the large number that just go ""mwahahaha I have acquired this macguffin, now I am too powerful for you to defeat me"" and then die."

1	Yes because printing money can't affect the value of it	And to a State that is already having trouble balancing their budget ( they can't print money like the Feds can) taking on that responsibility with strings attached is a roll of the dice at best. If the State does not want to set up exchanges, the Feds do it anyway. Easy.

Fuck the Howard Deans and John Conyers and Elizabeth Warrens. Fuck the Rachel ~~Maddows~~ Mouthpieces. Cowards &amp; opportunists such as them had to bail on years worth of public statements &amp; positions to support $hillary. The anger and indignation isn't for Blue Dawgs and ConservaDems. Of course, they would get behind $hillary. This is for every ""Dem"" who claimed the mantle of ""populist"" or ""progressive"": Fuck. You. Fuck every one of them for their cowardice and willful ignorance. Trump is 100% their fault. They chose to ignore Bernie's attendance draw and f-tons of polling that indicated Bernie's crossover appeal. They chose to hype lies and promulgate slander against the one person who represented what they claimed to believe. They ignored Bernie's track-record of honesty, straight-forwardness and being an excellent prognosticator on every major issue to face the US for the past 30 years. They ignored (and sometimes aided) Team Clinton cheating and, worse, turned a blind-eye to Sanders as he continuously (and against much advice) stuck to the high road. Now the people who berated our collective gag reflex while forcing $hillary down our throats want a seat at the table in whatever the new dem/prog/lib structure turns out to be? Fuck. Them. Every one of those opportunistic, enabling chicken-shits can Go. To Hell. /rant"

In public it just seem to be some very pretty, and slightly non-standard jewelry she gets compliments on. It also can be worn as a necklace when its not practical for it to be on her hand.

1	Well no, the reason that Kota lost is that Susie is a literal descendant of Satan.	Not enough #stradegy. But srsly though, you have a tribe full of the normal, white, well-to-do, upper class American people who have a uniform alliance, and then a tribe of dysfunctional nontraditional Americans of many ethnicities, unconventional or even lower-class backgrounds, and are generally off the radar. Imagine an entire white collar tribe against a No Collar trainwreck, and the latter wins and the white wealthy people all get voted off by people who ran a trainwreck tribe, and the only of the white collars to survive is a 57-year-old skeletal professor who is self-admittedly not strategic. So it's the opposite of fundamental strategy with a heaping of classist bias that gets people so angry. Add a twist at the F10 that could have given the Kotas a majority except they mishandled a critical ally and you have the same people crying rigged against it, which makes the rise of the No Collar people even more infuriating to them.

Can some shed insight on why 150+ fps is needed. Somebody mentioned the other day that you can feel the difference between 150 and 300fps for bhoping. I'm using g-sync at 144hz and wonder if i should stop.

1	Yes, but, if society doesn't seem people committing crimes as criminals, where all criminals are evil, how am I supposed to lead a fascist regime, slowly breeding the very concept of independence and freedom out of them, in order to move to a more perfect world, devoid of war and degeneracy?	"Interestingly enough he did break some laws and was arrested a few times. However, the context of how and why he was was arrested must be taken into account and when that is done you realize that the laws he sought to act out against were unjust laws. Too often we believe someone is a bad person when we hear that they have broken the law and sadly we never really take too much time to think ""is that law a just law?"" Someone who is arrested for a nonviolent drug offense for something like possession of pot is labeled a criminal when in reality did they actually do anything that was significantly impacting on society?"

I don't have to remortgage my house	"Semi-related to the topic, because a medical professional has no way of knowing if a patient fully understands their discharge instructions, a method called ""teach-back"" is used. Instead of asking, ""do you understand what I've told you,"" or ""do you have any questions,"" you say, ""Ok, tell me what you're going to do when you get home,"" and let them tell you. Repeat whatever they missed and let them tell you again what you said. Many people, even bright people, miss a lot of what's been said during a consultation because they're still processing the diagnosis and treatment. This is also why it's good to have a family member or care-giver in the room during an exam."

There are ways to disagree with someone without the harsh words. They can think I'm dead wrong, I welcomed that. I did not welcome name calling and baseless insult slinging. I thought the people here, the people I asked for help in a difficult situation, would be better than that. I was wrong about that. And I don't need anyone calling me names or insulting me to understand that. I don't ever need anyone to do that to make me realize I'm wrong. No one does. No one needs to be abused.

We're talking about the idea that Hillary is not a leftist, and that Bernie more closely resembles the democratic party ideals of 30 years ago.

1	Doesn't rule out the roommate's _mom_, though, who clearly has lots of respect for Anita and her family ...	The cut screen and the escape from inside the house leads me to think it wasn't the roommate. The roommate likely came home to get her stuff, and the killer, not realizing the roommate was leaving again, left through the window to not get caught. The screen is what sort of leads me to leave the roommate out of it. Why would the roommate need to escape through a window? Doesn't make sense. Someone needed to flee the scene and couldn't do it through the front door. That's my take on it.

Just the first one to come to mind, it's a low end card that could power two monitors to be used in addition to your current GPU for stuff like office and web browsing, a GT 620 or something would work as well. If looking for a complete replacement then it may end up being a downgrade for autocad (assuming it uses the GPU heavily, not that familiar with it) as you wouldn't be able to buy a workstation GPU that would be an upgrade for under $400 and even then it still wouldn't power 3 monitors, meaning you'll be stuck with a consumer grade GPU like a GTX 660 or HD 7870.

0	It sounds like your wife has better taste than you in games.	"WSIG to play with my wife (who is quite demanding in her taste) I have no more inspiration. My wife is a pickle with respect to boardgames. We have quite a few games (**carcassonne**, **clans**, **hive**, **blueprints**, **citadels**, **eldritch horror**, **betrayal at house on the hill**, **pandemic**, **pandemic legacy** and **dixit**). Her absolute favourite game of the bunch is **pandemic** but we kinda overplayed it by now with the legacy (**Dixit** as well in the past with friends). I learned that she's not big on randomness due to dice rolling, so we only play **BaHotH** with a bunch of friends and she'll humor me by playing **Eldritch Horror** with me. But besides **Dixit** and **Pandemic** there is no other game on our list that she will say outright ""I want to play this tonight""; usually I'm the one who proposes to play a game and she'll do it because then we're doing something together (and something else besides TV). I'm looking for the next **""pandemic-hit""**, the next game that she'll want to propose out of the blue to play. But I'm having a hard time figuring out what it is that scratches her itch. I think I have narrowed it down to: * no random-dice rolling (like in **BaHotH** or **EH**) * some player interaction (so no multiplayer solitaire) * no cutthroat competitiveness (she thinks I'm ass when I play competitively - like in **carcassonne** I like to block :-)) * coops are preferred, but not a must (preferably no pandemic-clones, we have played **forbidden desert** and **pandemic** feels just a lot better) I was thinking about **Stone Age**: she played this game with her friend but she thought that it would be a lot more interesting with more people, and I'm looking for something that we mostly play with 2 (but maybe we can invite other players as well). Another idea was **Dead of Winter**, apparently there is a 2 player variant that plays well? But here I wonder if it becomes too random with the dice like in **EH** or **BaHotH**? Lastly, **Robinson Crusoe**, not sure about random dice rolling there. It's a bit more difficult, but she didn't think that **EH** was too complex to understand. Otherwise there are a number of designated 2 player games: like **patchwork**, **agricola all creatures big and small**, **jaipur**, etc... (but I prefer to get something that other players could join in as well). So help a guy out here to find the next bullseye game for the missus. I love her so much, but damn she's difficult."

1	Yea but think of that poor topless woman that you exploited	I had a topless picture of some woman stored on my computer login. It was no big deal - computer graphics weren't even that good back then. Of course I made sure it was never on my screen when a teacher was nearby. I'd also hacked the school network, and had software stored on my login which could find the password of any user on the school network. That's much more serious than a topless woman, I reckon. Well, one day some scumbag kid in the year below me decided to steal my password-stealing software. He watched me type my password, and saw what keys I'd pressed. Next day, he logged on to my account. That's also worse than having a picture of a topless woman, I reckon. Before he found what he was looking for, he found the topless woman. Then he got caught by the teacher. He showed her that it was on my account, not his - and I got banned from using the computers. He got no punishment at all for stealing my password so he could steal my password-stealing stuff! I was near the end of my computing A-level when I was banned from using the computers. My parents had to complain to the head-master that I couldn't do my coursework, before they let me use a stand-alone computer that wasn't on the network with all the other computers!

Yes i do. 1) I can no longer see pokemon that spawn ''near me'' since forever. 2) I can see pokemon spawn in smaller radius which is actually helpfull when u dont have something else to notify u for the distance. 3) It makes the game less abusable and makes me feel kinda more like an explorer. 4) It forces me to walk a small amount more distances which is actually one of the best values of the game imo. 4+1) It doesnt have to do with the tracker, but i can already see they changes spawning sites and rates even in small villages, which is actually a huge job.... I am not saying the game is in a good state, currently i have bugs at gyms, it feels sometimes laggy in general, when too many people gather around the game drops in stability, i would like a little bit more fights etc etc..... But i do not think that Niantic is destroying the game. Actually i think they already improved it and i am going to be patient because i love pokemon and i want it to succeed. If u dont like the game, stop playing it. Go away, pour your salt on your salmon. ps: even though i can see many good features in the game, i would only purchase items when the major gameplay bugs are gone. Already have that juicy 40euro watting.

He does. He has 3.2 million subscribers and loads of money. He's acting like he he doesn't have shit. And that isn't true.

The stepping stones are pure aids.

Make the spawns equal amount of tiles from chests, some spawns are just so ridicilous, by the time you arrived everything is gone, and theres no point playing on.. Remove the god damn forfeit boat? Youre fighting near them, someone understands that theyre losing - they leave, you dont get the loot, youve wasted your supplies, and now will probably lose. And the obvious - the gear is ridicilous, sometimes even you dont get a weapon from 5 chests, and even then it can sometimes just be a mith scimmy, i expected it to be welfare bridding minigame, not f2p wars. Make loot respawn and give keys better loots, if you fail to get anything decent at the start, youre done for, might aswell leave, not actually giving you a chance to compete, you just got out-rng'ed.

1	You know all over Germany there's swastikas everywhere because taking them down is seen as destroying history.	I can't figure out if they are removing the window and replacing it with a modern piece or specifically removing the confederate flags from the windows. If it's the former good on them updating art like that every 80-100 years can help establish eras of artistic representation (how the church sees itself throughout he centuries). if it's the latter that's just destroying history. Destroying individual pieces of art to conform with current politics can only seen as trying to cover up or hide shameful moments of history. The window needs to be preserved in a museum.
1	What do those scientists know anyway....	This, despite the fact that every major scientific organization on the planet is in basic agreement (and released a statement to that effect)that the planet is warming, humans are the dominant driver now, it is a bad thing. We do deserve what we get but it will be unborn kids and grand kids that bear the brunt of it. I hate humanity.

In some threads here I read that some users were stuck in supreme for like 300 wins or some got global after 15 game win streak. That is crazy, I will be bored to death to play this ge for so long, so my question is, how did you get your GE rank and how many win streak you had to get before ranking up?

1	No you see women are victims too in that situation because that's a result of society viewing women as weaker than men.	Don't even look at that, the most compelling evidence of this is how people reacted to those two actors who acted like they were physically abusing each other. In one instance they laughed and egged it on, the other they were ready to beat the shit out of the perpetrator. Can you guess which is which?

He is number 1 on the current leaderboards which when released didnt count anyones previous wins. in the timezone he has gotten more wins than omniskillz. ALSO omniskillz is good but his number 1 tactic is to remain hidden in the gas for a very long period, he is good but if it came down to combat skill and shooting inboxes will probably rape omniskillz. and like i said for the time period since leaderboards inboxes has infact gotten the most wins if he is rank 1

1	Thank God the right of business people to sell pictures of children being raped is going to be protected.	On another note apparently they may or may not decide to prosecute people for (non-sexual) naked pictures of their kids, which is ridiculous. At least the freedom of expression of manga artists was rightfully protected.
0	If you are giving your opponent enough time to turn car factories into tank factories, you're doing it wrong.	if they were nuking industrial centers it would be stupid to not nuke Detroit.

Why would anyone lie on the internet.there cant be a secret agenda behind a secret group of hackers that absurd	Are ISIS using bitcoin? (conspiracy theory) So we know an idiotic 'journalist' lied when posting an article about ISIS having $23million in bitcoin (see @postmoi twitter feed) Yet what about this $3million bitcoin account that GhostSec claims to have uncovered? (that Lewis Sanders IV stands by and also confirmed by @DigitaShadow (GhostSec) as reported by newsbtc) This is now widely being reported in the press as fact, yet no address has been released By announcing the 'find' they have already alerted ISIS to it being compromised, so why not release the address(es) so community can help monitor the bitcoins and hopefully eventually track down the terrorists?? Using the 'ongoing investigation' line does not add up- either someone is lying about the $3million or they shouldnt have made this public/ or they should release address(es)? The fact GhostSec has openly said it is working with the Feds 'to thwart attacks' makes me even more suspicious Timiing of this hitting the press just as emotions are running high over Paris and EU Commission meeting to potentially 'ban' bitcoin also seems 'convenient'?? If I disappear, everyone please keep asking questions!

But can you identify negative 'male' traits that aren't seen as negative because of an association with femininity? Physical weakness, being short, being emotional, being uninterested in sports- in men these are seen as negatives directly because they're associated with femininity. The inverse and counterpart of this is traits which are seen as negative because they are hypermasculinised, i.e., intentionally cultivated as excessively masculine (for the sake of establishing that one is masculine because being confused for being feminine would be bad). Examples would be physical violence, dominating conversation, inappropriate sexualisation of women, etc.

0	Dilla, Dre, Just Blaze?	I don't know. His first few albums were pretty conventional. Some catchy stuff but if he retired before 808s I think his solo work would just be remembered as one of many good rappers of the mid-2000s. His production before that might have set him apart but most people don't really think of producers as icons.

It's probably better for them to play what they're good at rather than jeopardizing your team. When you get to the ELO where team comp matters, chances are your team will know that and pick accordingly.

Every time it comes up, it boggles my mind. Don't fuck drunk people, particularly people who are *clearly impaired*. I've known this more or less my entire life, because it's common sense. Maybe it's because of my own personal experiences, maybe it's because i've spent more then 20 seconds thinking about consent, maybe it's because i'm not some kind of sport-fucking frat boy, but it's never even crossed my mind to take advantage of some drunk person.

1	Are you white and claiming to be Cherokee	"Someone from a federally recognized tribe just called me a ""fake Indian"" because mine is only state recognized... I understand there are fake tribes. There are a ton of them, and some are even state recognized (like all the ""Cherokee"" ones in Alabama, the ""Cherokee"" on in SC, etc.), and I admit I'm not enrolled yet, but my grandpa is enrolled. Our pow wow is actually this weekend, so I'm waiting until it's over to enroll because the council and the chief are really busy right now. I tried to explain that yes, there are a ton of fake tribes, but that doesn't mean all state recognized tribes are fake. I told him the Pamunkey were state recognized, and they didn't get federal recognition until last year, and how I know the enrollment requirements for a few other state recognized tribes, and they're really strict. He said it doesn't matter, a tribe isn't real until it's federally recognized. Ugh. I just don't get it. I know that we're not federally recognized. I believe (but I'm not positive) the tribe's started the process for applying for it, but they're not done yet. But it's like this guy thinks Indians just appear out of thin air when they get federal recognition. My grandpa was called names growing up, he was kicked out of places for being ""colored"", he was called ""Injun"" in the army because he's Native American! He's experienced prejudice because of his skin color, but he didn't get enrolled with his tribe until this year, because 1) he honestly didn't know what he was, his grandparents just said his great grandfather was full Indian, and 2) we all just thought it was family lore until I found the census records. He's NOT a fake Indian. Sorry for the rant, I'm just annoyed."

If he wins Indiana with 52% or so (which he may), it's only a net gain of one or two delegates. So although he gains slightly, he's lost much more in the sense that there's now fewer opportunities to win delegates. In other words, it's a marathon and hes running a 6:00 per mile pace to Hillary's 6:10 pace, but Hillary is three miles from the finish line and Sanders is five miles behind Hillary.

If it's emotional then I think the first step is to determine whether it's a problem with you or a problem with the relationship. One thing I noticed is you said the sex isn't great recently.

1	nah mate, all just project fear and the bureaucrats tanking our economy deliberately to teach us a lesson.	Its not biting yet, which affords them the opportunity for optimism. Give it a few weeks and price rises are going to start kicking in, and people are going to suddenly realise that their paychecks aren't providing the same standard of living that they used to. Even then it will take a little time for it to sink in, a little tightening of the belt, a reliance on credit or savings. But eventually they're going to find it very frustrating to readjust to the new reality they've woven for us all.

1	I think this is one of those fandoms that hates straight ships.	Does anyone else ship Undyne and Papyrus? I know I'm probably in a minority and it's far from canon, but I think those two would be really cute together. Undyne looks out for Papyrus and keeps him in line while Papyrus can bring some misadventure to Undyne's ferocious, warrior life. They both show strong determination towards their dreams and seem to bond well over cooking. Undyne and Alphys are the popular/nerd couple, but I think Undyne and Papyrus complement each other better.
0	Maybe the last 10 years.	Is this the deepest era of tennis? Even with Nadal and Federer not being good as they used to be, we still have incredibly deep pool of top 10 players. Djokovic, Murray, Wawrinka, Del Potro, Nishikori, Berdych, Cilic, Raonic, Thiem and Tsonga. Is there an era that has more depth than this?

He just accidentally admitted it himself.

Hey, why not have something similar written by that guy who did all those Gor novels? I'm sure his kinks won't have any effect at all on his sexual politics. Wasn't the New Statesman a serious publication at one time? Or am i confusing it with the Daily Mail?

As someone who doesn't partake in either of these I would side with prostitution. I think that would save more lives and help the lives of women being hugely exploited.

1	You're the only one with this problem	"The Problem I Face with Competitive CS:GO Hey guys! I'm Calebrox124, I'm an MGE in competitive with 160 wins and over 400 hours logged. I am on the verge of quitting Counter-Strike competitive as a whole and leaving the space all because of something I have way too much trouble with, and something that could be easily fixed with new systems implemented by Valve. Trigger warning, opinions ahead. I'm going to brag a bit during this, but only for the sake of the argument. I'd like to start off that I am NOT a bad player, by any means. I am almost always top fragging or at least mid fragging on an off day. I play with players high above my rank (i.e. LE+), and I know the atmosphere of a serious competitive match. I've seen and studied almost every WarOwl video since August of last year, perfecting my own game and learning all of the newest strategies and metas. I'm a sick flick shot with the AWP, and I can rotate faster than a revolving door. I study all of the new updates and how they compare or conflict with my gaming style. I have put in the work it takes to be a necessary part of any team, and I am very active in the eSports scene, especially anticipating ESL's next major (Virtus Plow!). Everything the pros do, I try to reflect in my own playstyle. I have put in the time and effort into practicing, warming up, and eventually playing competitively in CS:GO's matchmaking. And I get absolutely shit on by my teammates and the enemies. The problem I face with competitive CS:GO is the lack of caring teammates, and how frankly easy it is to get to certain ranks. I have two points to make on this topic. First, for the LOVE OF GOD GABEN, make AT LEAST the top fourth of the ranks hard as all Hell to get into. No one who is intensely salty, doesn't use strats, or simply gets carried to the rank should be allowed to stay there. This is my biggest complaint, because I see every single day noobs who come to this rank, in which I get queued with them because it's tough to get a full lobby (more on that later) and ruin the game for everyone. It especially kills me to see people who are LE+ with less common sense than I do. This isn't a complaint for my own sake, I'm not crying because I wasn't carried into the higher ranks. I'm saying that around MG2, people should start to get tested heavily with teamwork and compatibility. If your teammates don't get along well with you because you're an ass, that should reflect on your rank. This same principle affects every other aspect of life. Secondly, I'm going to complain about my fellow teammates. I'm the type of person who can really shine with a full 5-man team, all working together, peaking together, doing strats together and all that. I flourish in this atmosphere, and if this is the case, I feel my best and I can play my best. Unfortunately, for the other 90% of the time, I'm stuck with idiots who don't even know their spray patterns, yet have 200$+ knives. I need more than someone with the ability to aim well in on my team, and matchmaking isn't somewhere I can find this. And it's not as simple as asking around, finding good players and queuing with them solely. In the MGE levels, it's mainly full of newb idiots or smurfs. The one or two ""good"" players that do come on don't play often enough to be interested in a long-term engagement. Through the entirety of my time playing CS:GO, I can count on my hand the amount of people who turned out like me, and most of them don't play anymore for the same complaint as this; lack of caring and ""good"" teammates. This is another problem that would be fixed with better, more personal rankings for matchmaking. In conclusion, I've hit a wall with how much I can improve on myself without a team to improve with. I have no more drive to be promoted, and I don't see the point in trying anymore. Every game's the same, and not even a 5-man lobby with LE's can make a difference when I'm mid-top fragging every game, yet still losing because the LEM has 4 kills by the end of the first half (yes, this happened today.) I need advice. It's why I've come here. I need help finding motivation, and if anything, proper teammates. If anyone out there feels the same as I do, let me know by a reply. I'll be watching this thread for a while, and I'll be thankful for any attention. Thanks for reading my rant! You guys are awesome! (P.S. This is the time when I ask if anyone else is stuck in the same situation as me. If so, for the love of God, add me on Steam. I'd love to meet you. IG: Calebrox124)"

0	Very insightful, much appreciated.	"The Pope can leave any instructions he wants to, but nobody is obliged to follow them. Voting is by secret ballot, so the Pope has no means by which to force the college of cardinals to pick his preferred candidate. And as far as making them do random things, no, he has no real ability to do that other than normal persuasion. The Pope's pronouncements are only considered infallible in certain very specific contexts. I suppose he could quietly tell a bishop ""do this or you're excommunicated, but that counts as normal persuasion too, though on the shady side."

0	Nothing wrong with the current surrender vote.	Do not show how many Yes or No's during a surrender vote. Just show the amount of people that voted. And in addition, if people do not vote, then they shouldn't count at all. Example. 5 people vote, then a successful surrender is 4:1 If 4 people Vote, then a succesful surrender is 3:1 It's fine if people don't vote, but they shouldn't affect the outcome of a vote by not voting. If they truly don't want to vote, they shouldn't count in any way, shape, or form.

They're heavily tracking their players with e.g. GPS and other monitors + specialized data from i.e. OptaSports (not the one you can access) analyzed by phd statisticians. It may not be as important as in baseball, but perfecting throw-ins is an important edge for the best teams of the world."

1	It was a bank robbery.	"Jason Chaffetz, Carly Fiorina and the Republican Party owe an apology to Planned Parenthood and the American People for fomenting hatred and inciting violence against the organization. The language that Republicans have employed against Planned Parenthood over the last several weeks has been appalling. They have falsely accused the organization of being at the center of an illicit industry focused on increasing the number of abortion procedures in order to profit from the sale of ""baby parts"". Even if that language did not directly lead to the violence that was recently perpetrated against Planned Parenthood, it is only a matter of time before this language *does* directly inspire such violence. This is the type of language that fascist dictatorships use to foment violent action against their political enemies. Worse still, most of the Republicans employing this language lack the conviction of their words and are merely attacking Planned Parenthood in order to further their political careers. If we as a nation can't demand and receive an apology from these demagogues, as well as assurances that they'll stop attempting to terrorize their political opponents, then we may as well pack up. Because a two-party system can't last long where one of the parties starts to use pogroms and assassinations as legitimate tactics and no adults in the room stand up and call them out on their despicable and cowardly bullshit."

0	Turns out they've been dying Jon's hair darker for the show.	It's sub-optimal casting. Given that they already had Kit Harington playing Jon, it would have made more sense to pick a very dark-haired girl for young Lyanna. Perhaps she was cast for being able to do amazing things on a pony (speaking here as a lousy rider). It'll be interesting to see whether older Lyanna has darker hair. Hair can darken during the teenage years. At least the actor cast for Rickard Stark looked plausible as Kit Harington's grandfather.

I'd be pissed if my boss asked for one. I never call out. However, this dumbass posts to Facebook what he's doing when he's supposedly sick. I work fraud investigations full time and loss prevention part time- like I don't know how to do the simplest of investigations... Bright side is that he's getting fired next week for falsifying time sheets- he also leaves hours early or arrives hours late and puts in bogus time sheets. He has no clue that we know.

Sorry if this has already been asked, but can someone explain to me why the entire crew aborted mars after about 18 days because of a sand storm? It seems many years of planning &amp; lots of expense to get a crew to mars and to have them just up and quit on a whim two weeks in seems a tad unrealistic. There also was a lot of infrastructure setup there, and not sure how they would have constructed all those buildings in 18 days

This post left me really confused maybe cause I've never had a boyfriend and I've been married to a woman for a very long time. How does assuming male role even works? Do you delegate one person to wear jeans and t-shirt while the other wears a dress? Does one person make inappropriate jokes about their dick and pretend to be emotionally unavailable?

0	Was it Rumer Willis?	I thought she looked okay. She had a big chin that others made fun of behind her back but I honestly never noticed it. As for being aggressive I can't say for sure. She was more experienced then me so maybe she just knows what she wanted and went for it. What I learned that day is how fucking hot I find it when a woman takes charge during sex. We tried having a relationship after that but it just didn't work out. Besides the sex we didn't really seem to connect well when we were 1 on 1. We did much better with other friends around us. It didn't help that she was really into weed and cutting herself while I was a straight edge kid (at the time) and clearly couldn't help someone with that kind of emotional baggage though I gave it my best. In the end it just wasn't meant to be.
0	pretty sure no one plays bot games to have a late game scenario.	Please remove MMR from AI matchmaking I play AI very frequently (Almost 700 wins), in fact, I don't play much of SR normals at all. I like to wind down with a nice AI to have a little fun, but one thing I've noticed is that when I do queue for AI games, I get paired with other level 30s with several hundred AI wins. While winning every game is nice, there's absolutely no challenge and most games end at the 20 minute mark. I'd like to be grouped up with random teammates to see if I can help out newer players and possibly go against bots who aren't 0/11. Since there's no real player balance issues (Don't have to worry about experienced players playing with newer, it's a co-operative game mode) I don't see why there's much of a point to have it enabled on AI games.

That basically implies that the company is never at fault, and it's only the employees fault that they don't fit in. That means that the company would never have reason to change, which is a very foolish way of thinking which is not in the employees interests at all.

0	Legacy's there for a reason	Runescape lacks simplicity it used to have.. I won't make a long post because most of you won't read or just downvote this.. Recently I've spoken to quite a few returning players just generally and they really find it hard to learn the new combat system. For me, i'm fine with it, but for majority its hard.. it's really hard to attract new players if they're struggling.. Pre-eoc for example, people would log on.. just click and attack.. it was as simple as that.. mechanics and whatever came later.. Anyone could learn it.. and i feel with the new system it's definitely different. I'm not hating eoc or anyone of it, i enjoy it.. Just really wanna hear what you guys have to say about it.. Maybe this is the reason why the playerbase has neither shows growth or decline? I'm gonna get destroyed on this 100%.. I just wanted to let out my opinion.

0	Because Bethesda's knowledge of Fallout comes from skimming the Fallout wiki.	Why are commonwealth ghouls so different? (maybe spoilers?) So, I just rescued Billy Peabody in Fallout 4 and something about him has really bothered me. He's supposedly been in a refrigerator for 200 years with no food or water, and yet he's still alive. In previous installments ghouls are stated to eat (Harland in New Vegas, for example, talks about eating radroaches for protein and drinking condensation on pipes for water). Yet this child ghoul has been deprived of both food and water for 200 years. This got me wondering, are the ghouls in the commonwealth somehow different from the ghouls in the other games? They have a very clear difference in appearance, their eyes aren't bloodshot, they seem to have no issue growing hair, many ghoul's voices aren't even scratchy and as mentioned before they apparently don't need to eat or drink to survive.

1	I believe that GOT stands for Game of Twinks	Is GOT short for Game of Thrones? (Curious because the book series is called A Song of Ice and Fire, the show is Game of Thrones). If not, you should totally read that. If you want a gay-themed book, Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green and David Leviathan is a good book, as well as Every Day by David Leviathan (pretty much all of DLs books are gay). As for non-LGBT, there's East of Eden by John Steinbeck which I loved. Dracula is a good book as well, but these are just classics. I also really enjoyed Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska by John Green, and a book I consider a must read is The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. It's so good. In the realm of short reads, The One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate is a little elementary, but it's really good. Then there's Alice in Wonderland, Slauggterhouse-5 by Kurt Vommegut, and Animal Farm by George Orwell.

They are collecting the taxes that pay the E.I.T.C. from workers who earn just above the poverty level and from the true Middle Class, the professional class, not from the people who refuse to pay them in the first place. A wage suppression racket that is only exceeded in harm done to the people of this nation by the for tax money for profit private prison system.

0	This is the answer I was looking for thank you.	"Mr. Baggins was Bilbo's title, which as heir to landed gentry Mr. Frodo would inherit the name as well as the land upon Bilbo's death. Samwise's father (the Gaffer) had been Mr. Baggins' gardener, as well, so Sam would have grown up learning to show their family's employers the proper respect. When Bilbo left, but didn't die, Mr. Frodo assumed possession of Bagend but not ""Mr. Baggins"". By the end Sam could have certainly simply called him ""Frodo"", but I think he preferred to maintain a certain sense of propriety, for comfort's sake."

My reaction was as such: My body lurched from a seated position towards the case and yelled ""Are you serious?!"" It wasn't oc'd or anything. No strange behavior was going on prior. So.. Back to my old 560 Ti I still have.. Well, I hope you liked my story."

1	right - because the post-pension crowd is responsibly managing their 401ks right now and investing a little extra on the side to make up for possible Social Security reductions.	Overall unemployment isn't going to correct itself. My argument was that the current issue of an excessively older workforce will correct itself. Jobs aren't coming back, but the cycle of older people retiring which results in open positions at the bottom of the chain will correct itself. Basically, the effective retirement age has risen and we are correcting for that now at the expense of the 20-30 bracket.

1	3.99	How much would you be willing to pay per month to guarantee that Netflix would get streaming rights to every single movie released in theaters...18 months after release? Like most of you, I've had Netflix for several years now. After you've watched the 30 or so must watch tv series and picked out the few dozen good movies, you have to admit the content is somewhat lacking. What would the magic price be if we could guarantee that we get real movies 18 months after theater release. That gives everyone time to still get their cut. Big box stores, dvd sales, redbox and then it trickles down to netflix.
0	I've made the same mistake before ha	When I have fused two strands together end to end I hold both ends into a flame then when they are good and melted I smoosh them together. Next I reheat the area and then roll it in my fingers to make it smooth and so it stays. Did this on a bracelet that has been on for about 8 months now and it shows no signs of wear or ripping out. (I should note that if you intend to make a bracelet that you intend to just slip on and off do not forget to take it off when you shower because it can shrink just enough such that you cant get it off and if you are lazy you may just leave it on for 8+ months)

It's ok, mandatory history lessons in the UK pretty much don't touch on the British Empire at all.

Probably the same in Russia.

That's not proving its dead, it'll be a long time till 'it's dead', if it ever is. You guys talk about security stuff and shit like html5 was the god-thing, keep in mind that flash was a separate program you could disable easily if an exploit was found, while html5 is embedded into the browser, i'm sure there must be a way to disable it, but good luck with that then.

0	Oh shit, that sucks	"I think I delivered some back news today. So today I was processing our electronic prescriptions. One came over for Truvada, I proceeded to process it to the patient's insurance. After accepting the claim, I saw the copay was a little over $1300 still. Figuring there was copay assistance programs available, I figured I would give the patient a call and have him look into it while we ordered the medication for tomorrow. I call the patient, tell him I processed a prescription for him but his copay was high. I hadn't mentioned the name of the medication to him, just what his copay was and that there was probably a coupon or program of some sort he could enroll in. He paused for a moment, then asked ""that's for the Truvada isn't it?"" I confirm. He said he knew there was a program he would look into. Followed by another pause and ""they said they weren't going to sent anything over until they got my blood work. They must have gotten my blood work back."" I didn't know what to say. I told him it's probably worth a call to his doctor. In the mean time I would order the medication in for him. I'm pretty sure I told a young man that he has HIV today. It only took about 15 minutes from receiving the rx until I called him. You would think the doctor would have that discussion before sending his prescriptions. Anyone else ever accidentally deliver life changing news to a patient?"

I will respect the old school team more for the truth. There will be a back lash either way from this please just inform the community of further reasoning. I honestly believe that major parts of this video makes sense and that there have been multiple bugs/glitches that've been introduced and we also know your team probably wont go and check all of his old code for bugs over the duration of his employment.

"My friends and I used to play a game mode called Rogue where everyone puts their name in a hat and then each draw a name out. That name becomes your target and if you got your own name you were rogue and could target anybody. You could only specifically target the player whose name you had (unless you were rogue - free game) and when you beat your opponent, you took their name. It took out the ""I'm not the biggest target"" element while still allowing for dynamic multiplayer action."

0	Thanks for a good answer	Pretty much this. Many laptops have their motherboards set up such that the graphics card and network card are both competing with each other for communication bandwidth. Graphics are given priority in a competition between these two, so doing something that is both network and graphically intensive such as high end video games will cause frequent disconnections.

1	Great point.	"I should have posted this before hand before you think you're getting anywhere with your opinion... -Signal -Incoming argument of regurgitated assumptions of post. -Don't read other comments before assuming who you are dealing with. This will be unwise and in my favor. -Initiating ignorance now for an assumed repeated collection of snarky comments from news sources you are programmed to repeat without questioning it's authority or validity, this is you assuming their actually news worthy enough to regurgitate. -Hopefully user is getting paid to talk about said post with response, he or she is likely not going to get paid with what he or she responds to next by using questions like, ""what the actual fuck,"" to bait and gage user as they attempt to determine their intellect which is normally hidden from contextual view. -Insults are welcome if they are at least some what original, but repeating yourself will get you lost with where my fingers go or where they have been. -Use Caution and good luck! ---- But I'll keep responding since you said fuck. I enjoy that you actually scale the years behind. Let's stretch that to 15 years. 9/11 is a great way to collectively speak of or maybe even going back as far as Clinton era to recognize the housing crisis started with their deregulation of banks... But wait. Yes people do shit on Obama... but it wasn't this collectively. There was one news network and several papers that criticize his policies. As we should do for ANY president. That's our duty as citizens. But since you don't want to talk critically and be passively dull and not entertaining of such ridicule, I guess for a moment I'll jump on Trump bashing for a slight pause to answer someone saying, ""bullshit."" And ignorance it is... I'm really surprised you think this way of my post without responding to anything else. But I guess when you're programmed to hate someone more than another you've accomplished someone's social engineering for them. You actually think these are your thoughts? This shit you say when you are just repeating the news who doesn't report the rest of the world anymore? This is kind of rhetorical but you may repeat your response again and then say how everything anyone types bothers you. If Trump bashing is a form of therapy, when will their be healing or should we all give up and collapse the nation into a depression on purpose?"

1	Golly, I'm so surprised that Ted Nugent is a dick.	Ted Nugent. I used to play piano at a fancy restaurant in the upper peninsula of michigan. Ted Nugent is part of a rich-people hunting club and is well known for coming up to hunt. So, it's almost 10pm on a friday night, he and about 8 of his buddies come in. We're set to close and the maitre'd comes up to me and begs me to stay. It'll be a lot of cash for the restaurant, etc. Convinces the cooks to stay, and they get everything up and running again. The only server left is a heavy-set girl , and so she's got the table to herself. Now, she's a great server, intelligent, capable, and i've seen her in action oodles of times. She and I are the only two out in the dining room, i'm playing (exhausted because it's past 10 and I had 8am classes that day), and she's serving. They order massive amounts of food, multiple bottles of very expensive wine, and are loud and obnoxious. I wouldn't mind that so much, except for the fact that every time she turned around they immediately started making fat jokes loud enough for her to hear. It was clearly getting to her and after a while she was visibly upset. The maitre'd calmed her down a couple times, and eventually they took their tab (close to 1k) and left. This is close to midnight. So, two hours, I didn't take my usual rest breaks and i'm wiped out and my upper body hurts, she's been verbally abused all night, and the bunch of assholes finally leaves. They stiffed her and they stiffed me. No tips on a 1k bill after keeping the restaurant open for an extra couple hours for them.

0	Actually, if you can replicate it reliably by experimenting, you could make a really kick-ass video in slow-mo :D	I thought the same thing, but I tried imaging every possible scenario of how the pull string could have bounced up and tied itself in a knot like that one, but I just couldn't come up with a plausible one. The knot was way too tight, for one thing. Also, the pipe is fairly close to the ceiling. The length of string that would've had to swing over the pipe was much longer than the space between the pipe and the ceiling. I can't prove anything though. I'm sure that there's some freak scenario where if you pull on the string and release it at the perfect angle, it will form a simple knot. If this happens again though, I'll take a picture of it so you guys can judge whether it could've been purely accidental.

0	This makes no sense	It might not be as much of a problem there as it is with immigrant communities. The Russian and Romanian enclaves on Long Island went heavily against him, as did the Cuban Democrats who live in South Florida (although more Cubans are Republicans). In areas with high amounts of Asian populations, he is also getting pasted (with the exception of Seattle, which he did quite well in). I don't find this all that surprising. My dad left Poland when he was 16 years old in the middle of the night to come here back in the early 80s, and he is genuinely scared that someone like Bernie could win. I am a Kasich supporter, but I don't share that fear all that much, because we have a representative government with checks and balances, so no, Bernie can't jail anyone just because they work in the financial industry or seize people's farms and put them into collectives, even if he wanted to. But he does seem to have a messaging problem.
0	Flying solo to the Philly show as well, can't wait!	Go. I was supposed to go to the October 5th show with 3 other people but I'm the only one who bought a ticket before they sold out. I repeatedly told them it was going to sell out but people don't listen. Anyway I'm still making the trip by myself and it's still going to be a blast. Just realized your venue is a little different but I still say it's an opportunity you can't miss..

That's why it's so disingenuous to hear SJW's claim 'its just a joke' whenever they're caught saying something stupid. No, it's not. Their use of language is very careful and meant to bully anyone who doesn't agree with them. As soon as it's turned against them, it's 'just a joke'? Nope, sorry ...

1	Yeah, Mother Jones is just more tabloid scum trying to get a rise out of the ignorant masses.	What this article fails to address is whether or not these trades were abnormal in any way other than their success(i.e. the amount/value). Was there an abnormally large spike of trades that were successful? I'm sure many lost money on trades placed at identical times to these ones they describe. How can we be sure that these.trades can't be attributed to some combination of legitimate research/investing and sheer luck? This article is quite absent of factual details, and therefore leads me to be skeptical. I'm not saying big banks and trading doesn't have a large share of corruption, but I don't see the evidence to support these claims.

0	Cool, thanks for the tips!	It's a really fun game to get into. Best advice is to just get a distance driver and look up some videos on how to throw it, then go to a field somewhere and do some practice driving to get comfortable with how the discs fly (it's slightly different from a frisbee). Then find a nearby course and try it out. It's a lot more fun if you have someone else who wants to get into it with you so you can both stink together. It takes a little bit to physically figure it out, but once you do, it's a ton of fun. Lots of people have a ton of discs, but it's a bit unnecessary. Really imo you really just need a driver and a putter. I'm not even using a putter right now because I'm cheap.

(not a critique against you - I realize you're just quoting the article. I just wish the article had used the linked data and said that 41 people died and not sub-selected)

"The Star Wars experiment I was discussing the truth claims of TSCC with my NOM sister when I suggested that the evidence that supports the BoM as a historical account is exactly equal to the evidence that support Star Wars as a historical account. And that got me thinking It would totally be cool if we found people who have never seen Star Wars in their life and presented them the story as if it were truth (we can even give the story ""scriptural"" wording like the BoM). We would ask them to read the story and pray about its truthfulness and if the Force^TM is real. We could even set up a phony Force^TM church building and hold services for the subjects to attend. We can have midichlorian healing session and everything. I bet we could totally convert people to the ~~dark side~~ Force^TM"

I don't know what a TAM or SGU is, and I have no idea why the OP is so morally opposed to weddings. This entire post just seems like a giant ball of angry and gibberish with no explanation.
1	But it's not *exactly* the same.	No offense meant here, but did you even bother to read the Guardian piece on the Chicago PD 'black sites'? They *were* detaining people, without legal representation and prior to actually charging them with a crime, in a warehouse that was off the books and that served neither as a booking station nor as a jail. Yes, it may not rise *quite to the level* of the Gestapo, but that is far too close for an ostensibly free and democratic country. We also have documented cases of warrantless wiretapping, illegal gathering of phone and text conversations, and have become accustomed to seeing footage of unarmed civilians being killed by police on what seems like a nearly weekly basis. The United States is also killing American citizens without due process overseas.

It's his goal for the entirety of the part. Even in part 3 he's still talking about ruling over everyone, only now he wants to rule za warudo rather than Joestar Mansion/Windsloft. It's not until 6 when he starts evangelising to gay priest about Heaven that his goals shift.
0	Yea that's a little weird to me too, rep since now it scrolls the opposite direction	There were a few things I was getting stuck on earlier but all problems have been solved and I don't regret it too much anymore. The one negative thing I do have to say is that I absolutely HATE the new app switcher! On 8.4 I had Seng set up with Polus and 3DSwitcher, so it was very functional and cool looking. I've purchased and quickly uninstalled both Auxo3 and Lylac. Both have some major flaws I just couldn't deal with at all.

1	Reasonable comment, so by r/nfl bylaws you were downvoted.	Uh, it's not revisionist history to say he was our backup since he was our backup. It's also not revisionist history to repeat what I've said all along. For $14-$15 mil/year, I wanted Brock back. He is unproven but seems adequate, so middle-of-the-road money is fine for him. Instead, y'all went out and paid him $18 mil/year. You overpaid for a backup, and that's fine. That's what franchises without franchise quarterbacks do.

1	I agree, and in fact we should probably only listen to 3/5ths of what Lavar Burton has to say anyways...	Even if it is way above a necessary amount, it still stands that military spending is a defined necessary function of government, whereas PBS is not. PBS is an unnecessary government spending that people have gotten used to over the years and now think is a right, but it isn't, it is just tradition. Just like being the most powerful country in the world that can destroy all life on earth several times over is not a right, it is a tradition. Tradition makes neither of these things right. I didn't say that there was no room for cuts in the military budget did I? You just assumed that is what I meant. What I did say is that big bird is not something that the government is required to provide, but the national defense is. What level of protection we need as a nation is not something I feel like arguing about right now

Second of all, his *Hornets* team was in no way better than Kidd's Nets team that reached the Finals, are you kidding me? That team had Jefferson, Vince Carter, Kenyon Martin, and Kerry Kittles, who was a pretty good player in his day. CP3 had David West, Tyson Chandler, and that is it.

We finished the project and closed that site in 2013. There are a few sites left, one in Kentucky, one in Pueblo, Colorado and one other place if I recall right. I will tell you that the oversight and regulations that these sites are under is ridiculous. Between the military, OSHA and environmental rules it's both a very safe place to work (no, seriously) and also poses almost no risk to the surrounding area. Part of that oversight is informing the surrounding communities of what's going on.

1	False, The voters should have had a time machine or precognition to foresee what was going to happen in the playoffs before they started.	True or false: As bad as Curry was in the playoffs, he still deserved the regular season MVP (arguably unanimously). I say true. LeBron IS the best player in the world, most definitely. But he coasts through the regular season, and no one else could really touch Curry in the regular season. And that's OK! Credit to LeBron - it worked, he played 43+ MPG in the Finals, and he had one of the best Finals performances of all time and a well deserved championship. But as easy as it is to shit on Curry's playoff performance (deservedly so), it's hard for me to say that he didn't deserve regular season MVP. LeBron could win it if he played as hard as he did in the Finals, but he didn't, because he didn't need to. The championship is more important anyway, obviously! Thoughts?

1	[Test]	Here are some hard ones An emperor has 1000 barrels of wine he wants to serve at a party tomorrow. However, he knows that an assassin has poisoned exactly one barrel. The poison is lethal and will kill anyone who ingests even the smallest amount. The poison is also slow acting and causes instant death with no warning: if someone is poisoned they won't know until the next day when they suddenly drop dead. The emperor has 10 slaves available to help figure out which barrel has been poisoned by the next days party. How many barrels can the emperor serve at the party tomorrow, and how does he know they are safe? The best solution allows him to figure out exactly which barrel has been poisoned. Here's another one which I think is harder. 100 prisoners are lined up, single file. The warden places on each of their heads a red or blue hat. They guy in the back of the line can see everybody's hat but the guy in front can't see any of the hats. One by one starting from the back the warden will ask each prisoner what their hat color is. If they get it right they go free. If they are wrong the warden will shoot them right then and there. They are not allowed to say anything when asked besides 'red' or 'blue' and with no inflection. The prisoners do not know how many red or blue hats there may be in total, just that everyone has either a red or blue hat. If the prisoners are given all this information and allowed to come up with a strategy before hand, how many people can be saved? The best solution saves almost everyone on average.

You start with all option on the board, imagine magic if you had the option to pick which card you added to your hand each turn instead of just drawing a card. Your discard pile goes back into your deck/hand whatever you want to call that equivalent in magic. Creatures have a 50/50 shot of being rolled as energy instead of a creature to attack defend. The differences are immense! There are similarities, combat is one of them but that doesn't mean people should clump them as the same game. The game is attack versus defense, it may seem likes its ripped off magic but that's because magic combat is pretty simple.

Many survivors have walked into the city with this belief. Few walk out. However, there are others in other areas who are completely unaware that the military had any known action on the city. So people who enter the city either believe it is a refugee center or other means. Those people also die or turn, unfortunately. But there are many sane humans who did learn to stay away from the city. Many of them formed their own communities, but it was learned too late by said communities that the virus is known to infect crops. As of 2040, no known large communities exist anymore, though their hollow sites remain.

0	Samurai Champloo Cowboy Bebop Rideback?	What is a good, short anime for someone just starting out in the fandom? What I'd really like is a short, 1-2 season(24-32 episodes total) Shounen Battle anime that has good humor and an enjoyable romance sub-plot. SAO would suit this perfectly, but is there anything else? I've got a date who wants to get into anime. So far she's only watched the average amount of Pokemon and is almost done with Psycho-Pass. My initial response would be to get her into Death Note or FMA Brotherhood, but I'd like something shorter that we might both get into. I'm considering Haruhi, as it's a classic and introduces a lot of anime culture, and it's pretty short, and also SAO or AOT, but I feel that there might be something better.
0	I wonder if everyone will think Shatkins are so smart when the Sox sign him for 15M, after the compensation period.	Jays front office didn't read the market on Edwin. If they thought their deal was the best one out there and that they wouldn't get outbid for his services, they could've just gone into the winter meetings and told Edwin that they'd match any offer as long as it was within their budget. If Edwin's value drops during the meetings, Jays get him back at a deal and subsequently set the market for re-signing Jose cheaper as well. Instead, they offered Edwin 4/80, and told him take it or leave it. And when he decided to leave it in favour of checking the market, the Jays go immediately to Morales and overpay him too. The Jays read the market wrong. And i'd even bet, by pulling Edwin's offer so quickly, they killed his market too, which allows teams now to wait it out and maybe get Edwin without giving up a draft pick.

From what I understand, the quality of boot camp programs can vary a lot, even within the same organization. I'm super happy with mine. I think my campus has something like a ~90% placement rate for graduates, and it's in a growing tech area (Indianapolis). In researching their curriculum, I found some reviews that almost scared me off, but I went to a Meetup they hosted and a few other events, talked to alumni, saw how plugged in they are with the local tech community, and I was sold. I heard from multiple people that it's the best decision they've made for their careers. I'm not finished with the program, but so far, I'm inclined to agree. Do some local research if you're considering options. Don't trust Google'd reviews unless it's relevant to your local campus. Scope out the relationships and connections with area tech employers. Talk to alumni, especially; they'll know better than anyone if it's ""worth it"". tl;dr - Maybe."

0	Open a dance studio.	Engineers or engineering students of reddit, what other career pathway would you have undertaken if you had found engineering to be too difficult? According to my opinion most students are attracted to engineering major due to * Good salary just with an undergraduate degree. * Ability to create cool things. (creative nature of the field) * You help make the world a better place using science Some of the engineering students had done advanced maths in high school giving them a solid foundation. So they find the subject not very difficult. Others either not having done advanced maths before or due to poor in math skills find engineering very difficult. Most of them work extra hard and eventually become successful engineers. However, there is a large proportion of them who drop out of engineering and switch to a different major. I assume that everyone here decided to stay in engineering. So my question will be hypothetical. What career pathway would you have switched to if you found engineering too difficult? Will you be able to satisfy all the reasons that got you drawn to engineering with the different major? Please explain? I am really interested in the ones who got into engineering because of the cool science stuff or to help make the world a better place as PRIMARY MOTIVE rather than the high salary. If you only wanted a career with high salary then you would have gone to Banking. *All assumptions made are my personal opinions. So, might be incorrect.

0	"Lawsuits by people attacked by the ""protesters"""	These Protesters NEED to be stopped It is ridiculous that during a rally like the most recent one in Kansas City can be interrupted over, and over, and over, and over by these idiots who sneak in signs, spread out all over the crowd, and pop up like a game of whack-a-mole so that secret service can't escort them out. Can these people be arrested, or have charges filed against them? It's so stupid that this sort of misconduct is tolerated in events as major as these. You very rarely see conservative people protesting liberal rallies, and if conservatives started doing what these people are doing you can be sure that it would be ALL over the MSM, while situations like Kansas City are ignored. How can we turn this around, and make sure that these 'people' can't sneak into rallies to try and disrupt things?

0	Cool story bro, it's the same as at least 10 other posts I've seen.	My thoughts on the XP system I've had Rust for a long time, since Legacy, and I've gone through periods of activity and inactivity with the game. I liked Legacy a lot, but New Rust is infinitely better. Since the implementation of the XP system, I've actually started playing often again. I've played with groups on and off before, of usually 2-6 people. By far, playing with friends is the best way to experience Rust. It helps a lot when getting blueprints and pitching resources together and using the best strengths of individual group members. But lately, for a while now, I've been a solo player. And it sucks ass, naturally. Especially since I have more responsibilities and don't play as often as I used to. The main problem was getting blueprints. But since XP was put in, I can actually enjoy the game. Once I find a good spot to build, I actually stand a chance in the game now as a solo player. I am having a blast. Although it needs some tweaking and could be a little faster, I think it's still enjoyable and I would rather this over the blueprint system, or possibly, have a minor BP system integrated with the XP system.

You can go back to previous areas after your done with them, that's an open-world in my books, not a Skyrim/Far Cry/what-ever esque you can go anywhere at any time open-world, but the world is still open. And why is the fact that it's an MMO gonna change that? It's what I don't get when people talk about Pokemon MMO... most MMOs have leveled areas, if you go too far ahead without being leveled, you'll just find stuff that's too hard for you to beat so really no reason to go there.

1	Soon as mason costs them a grand final berth than he will be steppin in those shoes	Is Mason Cox the next Jim Stynes? I draw comparison between Mason Cox and Jim Stynes. When Stynes first played for Melbourne in the 1980's, his own teammates were quick to let him know he wasn't wanted; a gimmick rather than a true footballer. Gary Lyon once said that he was angry an Irishman with no background in the AFL was playing in the major league. Jim Stynes himself said he felt unsure his first years in Australia and battled criticism from fans and media alike. His first few years in the game were woeful. However, it was Jim Stynes character that would ultimately lead to his success to becoming a Brownlow medalist. That same character that had people admire him outside of football post career. Every interview or opinion piece I can find on Mason Cox is that he is a dedicated, hard working and committed person with those same attributes that Stynes possesses. The difference is, Cox has had a better start to his playing career than Stynes did. He is also loved by the fans at Collingwood, and outside of the club alike.

0	you mean flusha turning cheats on?	Pro mentality with huge lead at halftime switching to T side Watching G2 versus Fnatic right now, they were so solid on CT side. However, on T side, they're allowing Fnatic to get comfortable hence why the score is closing. Luminosity would be an example of a team who have a near perfect mentality when they have a big lead, I don't think I've ever seen them come close to losing when they have a considerable lead. CLG are by far the worst team at closing out matches when they have a huge lead. You can tell it completely causes them to lose focus adopting a 'don't fuck this up' cautious attitude to each round. Obviously the score gap is a huge factor in the level of aggression you should apply when you have a huge lead but if you're winning 13-2, 12-3 you should be going SUPER aggressive at round start IMO. Don't let the CTs get comfortable. If you don't somehow get a round by the time it's 13-8 then start playing normal

I'm glad I didn't get the college credit because 1st year university was that much easier. I barely had to study for chemistry whereas my class average was in the 40s. Just think of it as prep for university so you'll be ahead because once you're out of high school, your hs marks and ECs mean nothing.

0	It may have something to do with Naruto mastering sage jutsu that opened the doors for a more complete bonding.	How come other Jinchuriki don't have a mode similar to Kurama Link Mode? And no, not the mode where the jinchuriki are cloaked in a reddish chakra resembling their respective Tailed Beasts. If anything, I thought Killer Bee would have something akin to KLM since he taught Naruto proper control over Kurama.

I don't care if it takes them 6 months to get the zombies right as long as it happens. I'm a patient man, and I've already got my 30$ out of this game 50 hours ago. I would love to see the physics implemented so that blunt weapons can knock the zombies over, giving you a chance to escape.
0	Is there any data to back that up?	I would suggest that the best way to prevent abortion is to require men to actually pay for their children.
1	what a badass	I do what I want.
1	I'm sure the thousands of migrant workers breaking their bodies in the fields right now for barely minimum wage would wholeheartedly agree.	"The text says ""The survival of the human race has always been dependant **on first term** on the exploitation of women, without which it would have disappeared long ago"" I bring light to this because this statement is completely redundant and only serves to promote the idea of women being in disadvantage. The entire rest of the board is filled with similar messages, and the worst is that this is an officially endorsed entity in my campus while there is absolutely none endorsed for men's rights"

Tier 1 and 2 runes become absolutely obsolete once you reach level 20 and buy tier 3 runes (most basic of them cost very little since they halved the prices). Tier 1&amp;2 runes only look like trash in our runepage interface.

0	I like to watch Netflix while mining, it's really the only way to go.	I literally just started two days ago. So far I got a Venture, two mining lasers, a scanner, two mining drones (can't use yet until tonight when I get home from work) and that's about it. I have been mining Scordite, and as long as I'm at my comp I'm making about 1.6m ISK/h. So far I've been having lots of fun trying to get better shit to mine faster/more.
1	'just for the Apple keynote' Yeah, I doubt he would waste time and effort for a couple minutes on stage at some obscure company's event	Miyamoto is in the States, hopefully to shoot a Direct. How long does it take to make one? A ton of people were hyping up the fact that with Miyamoto in the US, there's no way he's here just for the Apple keynote. With that, does anyone know how long it would take to produce a Direct? The case is most likely different due to it being a new console, but NoA does some really neat stuff in their Directs compared to NoE (inclusion of Bill and Reggie and other employees for gags) Any ideas?

1	Yeah like all the violence that happens at beer festivals	I was there today. It absolutely poured down all day. I personally didn't see any arrests and the ambiance was a reasonably friendly and positive one. Police were only a perimeter presence even during the big smoke up at 4:20. To me 420 is about changing the perceptions of cannabis. Thousands of people getting stoned together and not one incident of violence. I expect it to be much the same all around the world. If it was an alcohol rally, it would be much more dramatic affair.
0	This is Art I'd pay for and proudly display on my wall.	"Got really stoned tonight and painted this. What do you guys think? :) I've dubbed it ""Einstein the Owl."" (x-post r/bakedart &amp; r/painting)"

0	Isn't there like a cool down on using tanks though, I'd imagine that's a little different if so If not then forget what I said	I used to play World of Tanks and they would charge a few dollars for extra garage spaces. Basically the same as deck slots, but you could store 1 tank in each. Occasionally they'd give out free spaces. Was probably a huge money maker for them, so I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard does something similar.

If he at least tried to look like he's playing for the shirt then I wouldn't take it, but it just doesn't look like that's the case.

1	Haha yeah, no person in power or politics has ever done that!	Go back to snorting coke and fucking hookers. Leave the politics to people who know what they're talking about.
1	"because ""my body - my choice"" obviously only applies to women"	What if after receiving a blowjob the girl tells you she had AIDS? You enjoyed the blowjob, get tested and find out you don't have AIDS but the fact remains the woman deceived you by omission. You should have had the oportunity to choose for yourself if you wanted to accept the slight risk of getting AIDS from her. Just because everything turned out fine doesn't mean it was right. This is the same situation, OP had the right to decide BEFORE he had sex with a trans person

I'm just praying that this guy runs as an independent or a write in campaign or something. I'm really curious to see if it's possible for the Tea Party to ruin a sure thing for Republicans in Mississippi.
1	this is our just reward for being peasants.	I'm assuming that the CTE camo is only available to those that have played on the CTE, which is nice and all as it's a pretty cool reward imo but it's a bkt of a shame that those of us on console don't even have a chance of getting it. If I could then I would play on the CTE servers, and I'm sure the same can be said for a lot of other console players with premium.
1	In other words, don't be diabetic during a police encounter or you'll be shot or tazed.	Best way I can describe it is, if someone took a slice of bread and stuck it in a glass of sugar water, and let it rest for awhile. A slight alcohol scent. Lots of cops will think someone is drunk because the person has a slight alcohol breath and the symptoms for hyperglycemia is similar to being drunk.

I mean I don't know anyone in the military, so who was I to say that some people didn't behave like that. But it seemed so showy. He then ""accidentally"" dropped his dog tags on the ground. Which also seemed weird. Who brings their dog tags to a bar and also aren't you supposed to wear them?

1	Jesus will magically transfer all the needed nutrients to her body via prayer IV, doncha know.	"Yeah. That's unfortunately not just a Mormon thing.

She went home and freaked out in turn to her husband, who told her it would all be fine because it was in God's hands. And she believed him! I know that's not nearly on the level of deliberately having another child even though you've been told you will die if you get pregnant again, but that's how it starts: with ""I don't need to take prenatal vitamins even though I'm having regular unprotected sex because Jesus!"""

0	Seems like some James Bond shit	Some Lethals/Tacticals that I would love to see on BO3 1. Decoy grenade. When thrown somewhere, it will create a gunshot sound and a red dot on the minimap. I think this has been in a prev cod. Either way it would be so useful on search. Can be thrown at A to juke the opponents. 2. A stun/concussion that has a lower effect but lasts a longer time 3.The ability to have a light and heavy grenade. The light grenade throws a longer distance, but kill radius small. The large grenade does the opposite. 4. two trophies. One to stop lethals, and one for tacticals. Each can stop 3 before breaking. 5. A bit weird but there should be a piece of equipment that creates an almost human pesence. When enemies use target finder or mms, they appear to see something. When they shoot they dont kill anything but alert themselves on the minimap. 6. Camera spike!!! Will be so sick on snd where pros throw one down to watch a narrow lane. 7. Laser wires ( Or some other name) When walked over, the player is informed that the lasers have been cut and an enemy has walked past it. Tell me your wacky ideas and what you thought of mine
0	IIRC there was a rumour (or maybe they actually did it) that Australia was going to require porn starts to have at least C cups	I took it as referring to animated/drawn imagery, not just pornography featuring people who look young. Surely the latter is ridiculous to enforce- prosecute an adult for having photos of their adult body (or that of their adult partner) on their own phone or computer, simply because of their appearance? Seems pretty unlikely.

1	B... but how will I feel special without effort then?	"Gamergate has no idea how to accomplish their goals, so I'll give you the practical solutions you lack. There are two ways you can change the behaviour of video game journalists: 1. Boycott video games. Stop paying money for games that you feel aren't being marketed honestly. If enough people do this you will change how video games are marketed. Realistically, you might come to realize that GG is nowhere close to big enough or committed enough to impact anything but comment sections. 2. Compete with unethical journalists. Became video game journalists yourselves and provide an ethical alternative. Succeeding at this would prove that ethical video game journalism is a viable business and force the current landscape to change. Realistically, you might come to realize that your idea of ""ethics"" is childish and naive because the business world cares about what makes money, not what makes forum posters happy. But this idea that your internet comments will inspire international businesses to change their models and likely go under, all to satisfy your sheltered idea of ethics? Pure idiocy, and everyone can see it."

0	American Horror Story has some strong female leads.	If FX got rid of FXX and ran Always Sunny, The League, and Wilfred on FX, I'd 110% agree with you. Right now, I'd say it's on par with AMC, which is still producing quality TV. Sons of Anarchy and Justified have weakened in their later seasons, and Fargo and The Americans are still young - they could drop in quality, though they are excellent shows. I think Tyrant and The Strain could add to it, but I'd say that the rise of FX is really something impressive. But right now I think we can all agree HBO is winning. Veep, Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, True Detective. Hell, even Girls is good for its niche audience. I'd say my one complaint about FX is it is a *very* male network. Get some quality shows with female leads and that'll propel you to the top easy - but I guess that could be said about most TV.

0	More like Knight is the dumb muscle that Consular sends out to smash things...	The Consular story is widely considered the weakest, and there are a *lot* of justifications for that opinion. I remember a random internet rumor (meaning I have no source) saying that the primary writer changed midway through, which is why the story from chapter 1 has zero relationship to the story in chapters 2 and 3. True or not, a large part of my own problems with the Consular story stem from that disconnect. We spend chapter 1 establishing the character as a Hero. We're doing tons of heroic deeds--saving people either using the shield ritual or keeping them from hurting others. And at the end of it, we get an *incredibly rare* honorific within the Jedi Order. We're not even halfway through the game and we have officially hit legendary status. It's really hard to move on from that point, especially considering that from then on it's forgotten entirely, other than us being called Barsen'thor by other characters sometimes. Then in chapter 2, we essentially become the gopher to a bunch of random politicians. First off, nobody likes politicians. Secondly, many of the yahoos we have on our ship are rude, unpleasant, bossy people. And we have to make nice and help them with their stupid problems so that the Rift Alliance will join the Republic. Of COURSE that is lame. Chapter 3 picks up a little bit; using the Rift Alliance as its core we start recruiting allies to deal with the Real Problem, which are the Children of the Emperor. But that *entire plotline* is weak. It's like an afterthought or spin-off of the Jedi Knight story, and not even the whole story, just the Kira Carsen part of it. Taken as a whole, it's pretty obvious why the Consular is one of the least-liked, storywise. There are no huge badass epic moments either. The closest is the final battle, and even that was kind of disappointing. Anyways, the only thing that really helps, when I play Consular, is to think of the character as the Knight's sidekick. The one who cleans up the Knight's messes and soothes ruffled feathers. There is very little difference between Light and Dark Consular, other than Light coming across as smug and Dark coming across as whiny (at least from my perspective). There's one notable decision point where a character can die ... but appear alive and well in a later class cutscene. If you're halfway through, just ... power on through for the achievement/etc. and then re-write the events in your head in a way that makes sense for your idea of the character. That's what I've had to do.

Do you think we will ever have an Enemy or Activity in game that is just beyond our reach? Atheon, Crota, Skolas and Oryx. All were a fun challenge. Does Bungie have it in them to put a Boss or Quest in the game that is just so staggering difficult it takes say weeks or even months to complete. I love having certain things done to show off to the community ( as we all do ) I thought having mult Flawless runs was cool enough. It really isn't. Having all the Oryx Challenges done.. what a blast but nope. Having beat all the content in the game on the hardest settings. Awesome. I'd love a true hair pulling, bleeding from the ears challenge. Something that is so incredibly difficult, so complex that it may scare most players from attempting. Anyone else feel this way?

0	Interesting, both seem plausible	Yeah, it could be what you described. But I'm also wondering if it was a result of how packet transfer (packet loss) functions in gaming, where the game is always predicting the most likely command/action of you and all others playing. I can't explain it fully, but maybe since Ahri was spamming her Flash toward her tower as she was rooted by Ivern, the server predicted that she would end up there, and so it made the Ivern Q dash that Zed took place him allll the way where she was trying to Flash toward. Bit of a longshot, but it's possible.

I was going down one time with a full basket and when I got to the landing with the door, I had to put everything down to open it. As I'm doing this I hear a sound that i can easily identify. The sound of pant cuffs from baggy jeans slapping on steps as you're walking down them. It was distinct. I knew no one was following me but I stared at the corner of where someone would have to turn eventually if they were coming down. The sound just kept going. Maybe it was my cat? Still nothing. I shrugged it off to a fluke and picked up my basket when i did I got my first, and only, super intense case of vertigo. It was so bad my vision flipped completely upside down and i fell against my wall. Maybe they weren't related, maybe i had a weird brain moment cause both, but to this day it still gives me the creeps.

Exploring the 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets of No Man's Sky So I was just having a think about this. The scale of No Man's Sky is literally astronomical. The Milky Way has about 300 billion stars. That means if 10 million people played this game, they would each be able to explore 30,000 star systems WITHOUT EVER SEEING ANOTHER EXPLORED SYSTEM. If you assume there are 12 explorable planets/moons per sytem, that means you have 360,000 things to explore. If you spent just 5 minutes looking at each place, you would be playing for about 3.5 years straight. *Insert Sean Murray mindblown gif here* And No Man's Sky is 61,489,146 times the size of the Milky Way. Ok I'm just gonna let myself out.

Just as ""battle"" could mean they animate, tango also could be interpreted as the same thing, or as just confusion, if someone doesn't know the phrase (which is only used in America, and therefore not unambiguous.) and on your point of them getting confused with other lands that could also be named the same thing, fastlands, battle lands, tainted lands, and urzatron could all be called checklands by a new player who doesn't know better."
0	In the perfect timeline Cheap Trick would be visible on the outside of the backpack, but given that walls thinner than some backpacks block it I guess it'd depend on how big the backpack is.	Could Rohan have used a backpack in order to beat Cheap Trick? Like, it's not showing off your back, so i guess that would work for keeping him off getting into others while thinking on how to take him off

0	Maybe there's a SpaceX fan in the NASA press department lol	You're definitely correct on the first two points. Media can be pretty blind to the facts and technicalities. And it probably will blow the wind off his sails when we successfully land.... But that's not what we are hoping or aiming for. I can't say whether the information that's been given is intentional as a result of that since none of it actually came from spacex. It's come from nasa or usaf. Which would be odd that they're trying to create some sort of competition on our behalf .p

1	You might want to throw in the	Don't let these ignorant sheep dissuade you from the truth. There are so many unanswered questions. For example, the 2002 Tampa suicide attack was done in a Cessna 172 weighing about 2,200 lbs, and it only destroyed about half of a single office. Simple math tells us that a Boeing 767 weighing 400,000 lbs should only be able to destroy about 90 full offices, yet it brought down the entire building with thousands of offices in it. Let's see how the reptilians manage to spin that one.

Roberts Rebellion is better left to our imagination. They could do Dance of Dragons, The Rogue Prince, Aegon's Conquest, Blackfyre Rebellion, The Ninepenny Kings, Dunk &amp; Egg, Fall of Gogossos, Valyrian Freehold, &amp; Valyrians exploring Sothorys. There is plenty more they can do without touching the almost legendary Tourney of Harrenhal &amp; Bobby B's Bellion.

1	Yeah whm is a bad class that isn't really used.	Do you think that WHM/CNJ has terrible traits? This is just a small rant from me about the traits that a Conjurer has because I feel that they are underpowered or weak. Enhanced Medica: Grants a 20% chance that Medica will cost half MP. (On average, that means that Medica will cost 90% of it's original MP cost. The savings do add up for healing intensive fights but I can't help but feel that no one would notice if it didn't proc at all) Quick Stoneskin :Shortens Stoneskin base cast time to 2.5s. (0.5 Seconds saved can make a difference but as a weak mitigation spell that should be cast in advance, I don't think it would really matter) Overcure :Grants a 15% chance that after casting Cure II, your next Cure III will cost half MP. Buff duration: 15 seconds. (It's alot of MP saved if you use this trait but the number of situations where you get both the proc and the chance to use it are extremely rare.) I'm sure a number of people disagree with me but I'm hoping that these traits could be reworked one day so that they'll be more reliable. What are your thoughts about this?

1	Thank god someone random set me straight, I thought my 20 years in the field and training taught me, but here I am schooled on Reddit.	Being a little stealthy killing machine has nothing to do if they pant or not. They don't build up a sweat before attacking their prey. They're ninjas/calm before the attack. So of course you wouldn't see them pant before. Your assumption defeats its own point. Cats pant like dogs when they work up a big sweat after rigorous play. Most people don't play with their cats to this point. But some cats love playing fetch, or running up/down stairs, jumping (especially when young) and they'll do it till they pant like this. Panting is completely normal for cats after becoming exhausted after play. If your cat is panting from not doing anything, then there would be an issue.

Concessions to southern delegates representing plantation owners (not at all the norm in the southern colonies, but a special interest that demanded attention just as the northern industrialists did,) are not the same as the purpose of the document. The 3/5ths compromise et al. are real history, but they aren't the primary reason for having a national charter document!

0	"It's also worth noting that if you pay for the Job Seeker Premium subscription, you can ""feature"" your application which automatically puts your LinkedIn application to the top of the list."	"This is just one data point, but I'm trying to change fields, and the one single job interview I've managed to land in a new field has been applying via LinkedIn. And that's one success out of maybe only five or ten jobs where a LinkedIn application was an option, so a pretty stellar ratio. Meanwhile, I've sent countless apps through company websites without hearing a peep. And it's such a seamless process compared to the fuckery that is most company website applications. LinkedIn gets a lot of flak for being the dorky second cousin of social media that nobody likes, but if applying through them became the norm for the hiring process, it would be a huge improvement. Just make sure your LinkedIn profile is as sharp as you can get it. Professional headshot or other nice photo, max out the ""skills"" section, get endorsements from former supervisors if you can."

1	wow really scared the shit out of me	story about a Ouija board I should state this is not my story but my dad's He never used a Ouija board. So a bit of background is that my dad lived in a small town with one school that went from kindergarten to 12th grade. He was in sixth at the time. I should also state that the highschool is in the basement. His teacher sent him to get something from one of the highschool teachers. When he started walking towards the basement he felt uneasy. Going down the stairs he felt even more uneasy until he got to the door and paused infront of it. He heard a bang on the door and slowly opened the door. He looked at the door and saw a planchette sticking out of the door. The teacher was at his desk a Ouija board on his desk. He was pale and looked at my dad. My dad asked what the hell had happened. The teacher explained that the planchette had started spinning presumably when he left the room, it started spinning faster and faster and soon flung towards the door as he was about to open it. If he had opened the door as soon as he got to it, The planchette would have stabbed him.

If he dropped it into the airbox it would be impossible for it to end up in the combustion chamber.

This guy must have no idea what he is doing or he is just careless. Probably both.
1	obviously obama the lizard person	"I slept with a crazy girl last night I had never seen anything like her. Beautiful, smart, funny, relatable, anything you could ever ask for in a girl. I was in love, granted I had only known her for a few hours, but I was in mad love with this girl, this woman. She had a twisted sense of humor, I caught on to that as soon as she drunkenly and playfully ran a knife across my arm, acting like she was going to cut it off and laughing like a maniac while doing so. We got some weird stares from others at the bar but who cares, I was with this gorgeous woman and as crazy as her laugh sounded it had a beautiful ring to it. I should have noticed something was off about her as soon as she was buying me beer after beer, shot after shot. But hey I was getting free alcohol, what's the matter with that? This continued on through the night until last call when I finally decide to take her home. She graciously left the bar with me, clutching onto my hand as I hailed a cab. As soon as I got one, I opened the door to let the girl- what was her name again? Did I even get it?- into the cab but as soon as the driver turned around to look at us he got this awful look in his eyes and sped off, with her foot already through door. I didn't see her yank it out before he sped off, she should have been dragged right behind him but I looked at the beautiful girl in the beautiful, skin tight teal dress and both her feet were planted firmly on the ground. She was fine. ""Are you okay, is your leg okay?"" I slurred out and the girl just happily nodded at me. ""That was fucking weird why did he drive off?"" I asked her. ""Yes that was very weird."" was all she said and started walking in the direction of my apartment. I figured what the the hell and walked up next to her. That was the second time I should have realized something was off. She knew exactly how to get to my apartment, I'm sure I had never met her before, I'm sure I've never seen her at any of the parties my roommate throws from time to time. I would have remembered a face like this one. Pale skin, beautiful green eyes. At that time, how was I supposed to know that that face would come to haunt my dreams? I don't remember much of what came after up until we were laying in my bed. I don't remember fumbling for my keys to the apartment, I don't remember any sloppy making out, I don't remember falling into my mattress. Everything was a blank and then I was laying in bed with that pale face hovering over my own. Seeing as how this isn't a porn site, I'll spare you the detail of what happened next and cut right to the part where things started getting noticeably freaky for me. ""Want to try something different?"" she asked me. God, I still can't remember this girls name. It would make filing a police report so much easier if I could. But anyway, I nodded eagerly. This girl had my jizz all over her tits, one of the most amazing orgasms I had ever had and I wanted more. So much more. She sauntered over to her purse laying on the ground by the floor. Did she have that earlier? She bent over at grabbed some things out of it. Obviously, she was planning on getting laid tonight. She pulled out several pairs of handcuffs and tossed them at me, giving me a seductive wink as they landed between my legs on the bed. I was a little put off at first but I figured what the hell? It could be a good time. But she began pulling other times out of her purse. I began to wonder how she fit all of it in there. There were maybe ten or so black candles that she set up around my bed. I figured maybe she wanted a romantic vibe? Who knows. What she pulled out next, though, that's what scared me. I long, serrated knife. She examined it and walked over to me. ""You'll have a good time."" She said with a wink. She moved fast, I didn't even notice her handcuff my arms and legs to the bed posts. I didn't even feel her cuff me. That's when I got scared, I didn't think I was going to be the one in this position. She straddled my hips and run the knifes side across my body. The cool metal sent shivers throughout my whole body. ""This will be fun"" she reassured me. The candle light set a creepy glow around everything. She lifted herself off of my pelvis and put me inside her. I started to say something but she quickly slapped me. She got a rag- where did she get a rag from?- and gagged me. There's a gap in my memory from where they next few moments should be but the next thing I remember the knife was dug into my chest. She started carving me and I let out I scream. Jesus, I felt like this was going on for hours. The iris of her eyes began to widen, not the pupils but the goddamn iris until there was no white left and only green and black. Her pale skin turned to green scales and a vipers tongue came from her mouth and began to lap up the blood from my body. I began to scream as much as I could with a gag in my mouth. I was sure this was the end for me. I made as much noise as I could hoping the neighbors would do something but nothing seemed to come of it. All of a sudden my bed began to rattle and shake and that menacing laugh that I thought was so endearing at the bar cut through the air but the thing was, this girls mouth was closed. Her green and black eyes stared dead into my own and all I could hear was that god forsaken laugh. I wanted this hell to be over, I wanted to just bleed out and be done with it but I was still there, I was still feeling the knife to dragging across my skin. I began to cry. Right there, I began to cry. Them my door started rattling along with the bed. It was banging and rattling and then it wasn't there any more. My roommate ran to me in a panic and pulled the gag from my mouth. I screamed louder than I ever have before. ""What the hell man what did you do o yourself?"" Ricky screamed at me and slapped my face to snap me out of it The girl was gone. I was driven to the hospital and stitched up and I tried to file a police report but once I mentioned the eyes and the skin they decided I was crazy and did it all to myself. I was released from the hospital and I looked in the mirror this morning and saw something no one had mentioned to me at the hospital. The cuts on my chest and stomach spelled out something that I don't quite understand. The spelled out ""10 DAYS"""

I was in a H2H game great game was tied at half I got ball back returned my first kick off for a TD in a while, was driving down the field, when suddenly my little sister walks in shuts my PS4 off because we were suddenly getting dinner at that exact moment... Was a little pissed as it ruined my record at an undefeated season. I'm now 2-1. I get back a couple of minutes ago and play another. Another great game losing by seven but I'm about to change that. My little sister then shuts it off saying I have to tuck her in according to my parents... I'm kind of mad as this means no first round bye and an uphill battle to make playoffs. I know it's a stupid reason and family first but I take MUT seriously to and it's so uncool to do that. My record is like 75-85 but 20 of those games are outside interference suddenly and another 10 are people Quitting and me getting the loss.

0	That is hilarious.	A family friend was learning some of her Native American language (Chinook I think). But some Tribal Officials caught wind of it and send someone to hired her as an interpreter. She tries to explain to that she isn't fluent but the she was told that's fine and that she just needs to BS it. They all could speak English but they work in the old way of negotiation and debate where pauses in the conversation are common and everyone lets what is said sink in and respond only when ready. Though when they do this in a modern meeting they appear unintelligent so the translator is only buying time buy saying random Native words.

I noped right out of there and went home to do some research online (I know, I know, should've done that first). Found out that at right around my car's current mileage, the LED bulb behind the odometer tends to burn out. The replacement bulb was only $2 from the auto parts store. I now drive across town for all my OEM purchases, big and small. TL;DR: Dealership tried to charge me $800 for a $2 fix.

1	Personally I thought the actor they cast for young John was not so great	If we had gotten the TOJ scene in Season 1, maybe fewer people would have questioned the casting choices. This scene has been hyped for so long, it was bound to let some people down. Personally I had no problems with the TOJ scenes, I think Lyanna's actor nailed the character and she did a terrific job. I don't mind if she wasn't a fan of the series at all and in my opinion this has nothing to do with someone's performance as an actor. Lena Headey hasn't read the books as far as I know and she does an incredible job. She's also my favorite casting choice, albeit one of the most disputed. I thoroughly enjoyed the TOJ scenes even though something about Young Ned's actor seemed off.

Big (6'2', 217 lbs), Strong (19 reps at 225 on BP), Fast (4.48 40), and was one of the best all around safeties for us ever. He could hit like a freight train (just ask Jimmy Graham), he could cover, he could stop the run, he had everything needed to be the next great safety and it was all lost due to injuries that he couldn't come back from.

Since the Bucks have so many scorers that like to score inside, especially with the addition of Moose, do you guys think they'll have problems with spacing?

0	Assuming that it is intentional...	Nintendo Has Brought on a New Form of Marketing With Nintendo NX seemingly having its announcement coming tomorrow until the end of time, Nintendo has generated a kind of hype I have personally never seen. They are almost anti marketing the Nintendo NX and somehow generating massive amounts of buzz without effort. This reminds me of some of the ways some cell phone companies market their products by purposely leaking things or misleading customers to build hype. Nintendo is doing it in a very interesting way though, by barely participating. Not only do none of us actually know what the NX is going to be, none of us actually know when it will be announced. People are literally scowering the internet looking for clues, looking for info and just generally discussing something they know nothing about. Imagine if Apple didn't announce an iPhone event next year, but kept talking about the new iPhone as if an announcement was eminent. It's this same reaction really. I think by not saying anything Nintendo has also allowed their competition to fundamentally destroy themselves, leaving in Nintendo a big opening. Let's be honest, who was really hoping Sony or Microsoft would announce updated versions of their consoles you have to pay more money for? No one. Who was hoping PlayStation plus would go up in price by another $10? No one. Who was hoping that Xbox exclusives would release on PC? Probably most people with a PC, especially people who loved Halo growing up, but no one who's been loyal to Xbox paying a yearly subscription for years was hoping for that. When PlayStation said their main competitor was PC and Xbox exclusives started shifting to pc, Nintendo won a big opening. All they have to do is say look our console isn't just an attempt at replicating your experience you would get on a pc at a budgeted price. It's a Nintendo console, it is unique, it has character, it has a lot of awesome games you know you love, it's fun, you can play games at home with friends (no one else is really doing that to the degree Nintendo is) and best of all it's probably not going to suck at all. Nintendo learned their lesson with Wii U otherwise Reggie wouldn't make a comment like that because it would probably hurt him. Nintendo seems keen on going back to its roots, aka going back to the Nintendo anyone would love. I did like the Wii U, but the lack of content really killed it. That and the gamepad battery life, although the pro controller somehow has infinite battery so they should really try to replicate that if possible. There's so much new tech on the table for Nintendo to experiment with, whatever NX is it already has a big audience eager to see. That's an exciting thing, because I've never seen this level of genuine excitement for a console in ages. My hope is that they take advantage of this and really hit it out of the park with the unveil. Also to people hating on Nintendo for appealing to kids, the only games I can actually experience and play with my niece are on a Nintendo console. She refuses to play anything else, but what else is there on other platforms that's like Kirby Canvas Curse or Super Mario? Not much.

1	As the daughter of a republican politician, I'm sad my dad apparently doesn't love me.	"Oh, these Republicans aren't saying 'women matter', they're saying ""our women matter"". Look at the denouncement statements from Republican leaders today. Nearly all of them are saying ""I have a wife/daughter so I can't support him"". They're still not considering the plight of women not in their proximity. It's the classic theme of ""us men have to protect our women""."

You can get used to the Steam Controller but many would not take the time, instead deciding that the controller sucks instead of realizing they bought something that is... new. If you want something that you can customize till the cows come home, something that will control your HTPC and has more buttons, more haptic feedback, and more features than literally anything... get the Steam Controller. No controller will make you a better or worse player.

1	she is right on #1 because her pc has more expierience than yours and older than it = better	My mom's hilarious insight on PC's 1) Her PC with an 11 year old CPU should not run any slower than my brand new i-7 4770k 2) Why do you need a graphics card anyways, it says here the CPU has integrated graphics, you can save money on this? 3) Why arent you turning the computer off everytime you leave the room, it damages the components by having it on! 4) Why is my comouter so slow? I have *norton* and always check in all the boxes when i install something, look at all those toolbars! 5) Why buy this, the console is so much cheaper! 6) You shouldnt ever move on a desktop, the components may break and get destroyed just on a 10 minute drive! I didn't really know where to put this, but i thought you would enjoy it^hopefully^you^do.
0	Yeah but this article mentions turbo 4 or 6 cylinders	Yes, the early 3.0 models were 1) slow 2) slow and 3) sluggish if not slow. Lack of a V8 option was almost a deal breaker. The 3.6 in later models were slightly better, but something like a Northstar or equivalent with all the updates the current engines received would have been nice in that place, both ride quality and sound wise.

I went the other day and ate a healthy portion of food. Not a huge victory but it made me feel good non the less. Part of become fit is changing habits from the unfit lifestyle I have been living most of my life. I really notices it the other day at the Chinese food place. For some reasons in our society all you can eat means eat until you cant eat any more.

1	Yes, because living in section 8 housing is a lot better than living in a middle class neighborhood	Why would you want to be middle class? The most overlooked class in history... It's way more profitable to be upper class or needy. That's where all the benefits come in. Being a decent hard working person who's not too greedy or vain has never paid off for anyone, ever.

Oh, but she was being SOOO nice. If some asshole tried to hug me after I didn't buy the phone I didn't want in the first place... Bring the fake negative points, bitches. They hurt so good. After you down vote me maybe you should think about how fucking ridiculous this interaction was in the first place then think about how insanely lame it was to recount this scene to an anonymous internet audience for fake internet plus points.

1	"Yeah, who cares about finding someone you love deeply and connect with when you can evaluate your ""sexual market value!"""	I'm not sure if you're being facetious, but that is essentially the truth. And it's not so calculated . . . it's just the way it happens. The fact is that men like variety in their sexual lives, and they are willing to sleep with women who they deem unworthy of relationships. Women almost never sleep with men they deem unworthy of relationships, so they sometimes fail to understand the man's perspective. In the end, however, all of these super attractive men will settle down and get married, but usually it will be to an extremely high value women who is often younger than them. And even then, they will frequently divorce that woman in favor of a younger and higher value woman once the first wife gets older and her beauty fades. If I had one piece of advice for women, it would be to honestly evaluate their sexual market value by ranking themselves out of ten, and then aiming for men who are of equal or lesser sexual market value. If a woman is a 7 in the sexual market value scale and she is constantly chasing after men who are 9s and 10s, she may end up having sex with them but she will never get the relationship she's hoping for and is essentially wasting her time. She should be pursuing 6s and 7s who will value her enough to commit.

I always thought that was going to be a futile effort anyway. He should have focused his attention on independents, courting a very small contingent of disgruntled Democrats is not the best use of resources.

0	Thanks for the awesome tips!	Definitely! Having another guy to cover your back and possibly flank the enemy is a huge advantage. Also makes the game less boring. Just make sure you know eachothers positions so you don't end up surprising each other. Announce when you fire so that you both know it's not another player. Also try not to stick really close to eachother. The element of surprise is a big thing and if another player thinks there's only one of you then you can easily come out on top with good communication and positioning. It's comletely unnessacery to be looting the same building together. One guy should be looting and the other guy should be covering his ass. Or you could both loot different buildings. Just keep your comms simple and straight forward and keep your mate informed of which building you're in and where you're moving to. Having a friend also makes friendly encounters with other players easier as you will have the upper hand and a single player will be less inclined to kos. Anyway hope that's enough advice to get ya going and to stop ya from combat logging! Good luck out there dude! Just remember loot respawns and having interactions or firefights with other players is much more fun and exciting than logging out and holding onto your gear. Even when you die. Just try your best to learn from your mistakes when you die and get back into it with a fresh start :).

I know some of past is coming back, but it needs to come back at full force. I just wanted to take a moment and let everyone know that it always doesn't hurt to listen to throwbacks here and there to see how certain sub-genres evolved to how it is now.

Manziel did not look comfortable in the pocket at all, and that drop of the head scares me to death during the run. Hoyer was missing passes, but he looked far more comfortable making his plays and the passes to Gordon and Austin were spectacular. 2. Armonty Bryant is playing for a starting role, and man, he might just get it. Bryant is giving an impressive amount of pressure on that Lions line and made both Orlovsky and Stafford flinch quite a few times. 3. Hey Mike Pettine: ""Physical D"" should include far far far less broken tackles and loose plays. You gotta walk the walk if you're going to talk the talk.

1	You don't have to wait, TF2 was released in 2007	Loved TF and can't wait for TF2. The game just lacked depth. I got 50 goosers and GEN10. Had a blast and it was hard work. At GEN7-ish it started to become repetitive and stale. Not in a bad way, it just felt like groundhog day; like I forced play. I like the simplicity but I think they need more variations moving forward. More maps, game modes, etc. I mean games like Halo can be repetitive but online doesn't feel as stale as TF did towards the end. Just my 2c.

"Tiny bad - ""The talking wolves aren't magic"" Myself and a small group run an RP set in Europe, with a reasonably rigorous definition of magic and the like; on several occasions, we have rewritten these definitions for the benefit of one or other of our members, which is all fine. Enter N. N isn't a spectacular writer, and her plots aren't overly imaginative - ""That person who laughed when your character died? Surprise, she's evil"" - but that wasn't a big deal. People volunteered to plot with her, one of the writers in the group gave her some pointers, and all was fine. She wanted wolves. These weren't just any wolves, of course; they had names such as Appleberry, Storm and Layla (In Russia, I might add). They raised her main after she got abandoned by an abusive mother; they learned to speak German (not that anyone in the RP had been to Germany, not even the wolves, but ho hum); they leaped to her defense when some other characters came looking for her (trying to kill one without permission, I'll note). Fine, fine, don't worry N, we can just rewrite some of the magic things to make this fit - ""They aren't magic."" What. Whaaaaat. No, N, you cannot have talking wolves in the middle of Russia in an RP only differing from real life in the ""magic"" aspect without magic. You cannot tell me that wolves somehow gained the vocal dexterity to pronounce German words because they are ""very intelligent"". I refuse. I simply refuse."

I think the theory is that it's harder for kids to keep their balance or hold on to the pole while the bus/train is in motion.

Problem solved, without bothering a paying rider to give up their seat.

1	There is a Toronto BLM, they mostly just disrupt traffic and the pride parade, doing real important work	Is there a Toronto BLM? I dont hear much about cops profiling race in Canada. I live in BC and there is plenty of diversity in people both on and off the police force

0	Depends on the patch.	How often do these loading screen crashes happen? I've had one in the last 2 years....and it was because I thought I had crashed, when the game was just taking forever to start probably because of someone else. That is also when I realized I will never get past Gold/low plat because I have NO PATIENCE.

1	I'm proud to be an American	American justice: HSBC launders billions, no jail time. Charlie sells bitcoin to a SR launderer, 2 years. Words cannot express the sadness and outrage I'm feeling right now. Banks such as HSBC are found guilty of laundering billions of dollars not just for drug users but for violent crime cartels. Billions. Violent crime. And yet not a single exec faces a day of jail time. Charlie Shrem, who sold Bitcoins to someone who helped people buy drugs on Silk Road, has now been sentenced to two years in jail. If there was any doubt that we are struggling against an immoral system in dire need of replacement, let this end that doubt. Charlie, our hearts and minds are with you, friend. The work continues.

0	Ah the good old days of mapping left mouse click to the scroll wheel and using a .50cal sniper rifle in cod as a one hit kill shotgun.	I've always thought if you can break something with such a simple macro, then something else needs fixing. I've played some games where the max tap-fire speed of the guns where ridiculously high, and with a macro you could basically fire an entire magazine in a fraction of a second. Obviously, the correct fix there is to make that impossible with a sensible max fire rate rather than trying to punish people for macro-ing.

Selectively releasing information is the same as lying. Plus, it should bother you that the Russians may have something Yuuuggee on trump.

I look at him and chuckle from pure disbelief that I am really being asked this (mind you it is 1:00 in the afternoon) and I respond with ""excuse me?"" the officer said they got a call that some people were around looking into cars and shops! mind you all we did was skate up two blocks while of course passing in front of stores and passing by cars and of course there will be times my eyes will look at the business that is open in broad daylight if i want too or if its in my line of site lol the people who called it in did not even wait for 10 minutes to pass by before they call a group of spanish and black guys suspicious you would think the 2 white guys in the mix would have balanced it out but nope lol still."

0	race you to the drop	I hate you r/headphones Two days ago I was happy with my audio setup and had no plans of changing anything anytime soon, just two days ago. Sure I knew that at some point I'd pick up some HD 650's and the Magni 2/Modi 2 for them, and maybe even some used LCD-2's if I found a good price for them, but I wouldn't be doing that for years. But Massdrop just had to announce the HD 6XX and how could I not buy those? $200 for HD 650's? That's a no brainer. Of course now I'll need a DAC to use with them and I'll want a decent AMP to go with it, perfect time to buy that Schiit stack. Well since I left the audio market Schiit has come out with the Jotunheim and every review I've seen of that has been glowing (thanks u/ZeosPantera) so of course now I'll be getting that. The Jotunheim comes with a 4 pin though and I would love to take advantage of that so I'll probably get a XLR cable for the HD 6XX and maybe I'll pick up a XLR to mini XLR cable for my Q701's while I'm at it. Well that's going to cost at least $800 and I'm not even finished. Now that I will have a proper setup I can use the Jotunheim for my speakers, but I have Mackie CR3's, which are great and I love, but they're powered speakers and they wouldn't take advantage of the Jotunheim so I'll want to change those out for something else. I have no idea what I'll change those out for but I'm sure it will cost me another $500 to do. Sure I'll probably sell my Fiio E12 and my Mackie CR3 but that will only get me like $200 maybe, which is not much considering what I'm about to be spending. So I'm very excited about all these things I'm going to be getting, but I hate all of you for killing my bank account, especially you Massdrop because you started this. TL;DR: I'm back
1	Dude natural accidents and intentional, racially motivated murders are totally the same thing!	How the amount of people struck by lightning in the 1950's relates to the number of lynchings escapes me. Lightning has never congregated in mobs on manhunt to find a black man who murdered a white man and lynched 13 other black citizens just in case they were guilty. Among those men that were guilty, sentenced, and executed before being proven innocent was Hayes Turner who had a 8 month pregnant wife that who spoke out against his presumed guilt. Mary Turner was then hunted down, captured, tied down by her ankles, hung her upside down from a tree, and set on fire. Before her husband was executed, the mob cut open Mary Turner's pregnant belly, and her somehow still alive child was born prematurely and subsequently stomped on and crushed to death. Tuner's body was then filled with hundreds of bullets and then burned along with her child. We do not have an accurate count of how many lynchings happened in the United States during Jim Crow Laws, but we do know many were unreported. The facts we do have tell us of incredibly gruesome accounts such as Mary Turner's lynching that were recorded and should never be forgotten.

0	as someone who lost his father at 13, yeah, teens can go through hardship, as can children, as can anyone at any age.	"I strongly dislike this viewpoint that teens can never go through hardship. Yes, many of them don't ""have it bad"", but it harms the many teens who actually are depressed. Depression is a struggle no matter what age the person is, but I feel bad for the many youngsters who are legitimately, medically depressed and don't get the help they need because people brand them as some stereotypical emotional teenager. They can't help it if they have some neurochemical imbalance messing with their mind. It's horrible how commonly they are blown off and their problems invalidated just because we assume that they can't have ""real problems"" if they are between the ages of 10 and 20. And even if they aren't experiencing a medical reason behind their emotional state of mind, who are we to dictate what somebody is 'allowed' to feel? Just because we don't think they have a ""good reason"" to feel some way, doesn't negate that they feel that way in the first place. Hell, teenagers are going through some shit. They're learning to deal with many aspects of life for the first time, and it doesn't help that their heads are being pumped full of hormones, or that they are being pressured to decide what to do for the rest of their life. Yeah, some of them are straight up little assholes and probably a portion will be for the rest of their lives. But to group them all together and roll our eyes and say ""figures, another one of those twats is talking about suicide"" isn't fair. Just because we're older and made it through those years doesn't mean that it's not hard for them."

I do fear that tanks will become too strong if they have access to too much gold too quickly, but I think that item AND buffing most of the tanks would be enough to make them playable.

1	GGG should listen to more people like you who don't play the game.	I don't enjoy Labyrinth enough to even bother unlock Ascendancy classes I'm not the biggest POE player, I've played on and off since open beta... With the release of 2.2 I finally decided to follow a build and I've hit my highest level to date (52). The Labyrinth is so tedious and boring I cannot even bring myself to complete it on Normal to unlock Ascendancy classes. Since I have 10 week old twins I only have 2-3 hours a week to play and the Lab content is just not fun compared to progressing through the regular game. Hopefully once the game progresses to the next content the Ascendancy classes are locked behind the 6 trials rather than the Labyrinth, but I suppose that's a bit of a pipe dream.

So I've been playing smite since xbox beta. pretty much only play league conquest as a solo laner, and I often pick AMC. Nearly everytime I pick AMC as solo I get whiny bitches complaining how I'm gonna get wrecked, that I'm a noob, and why I even play league. A majority of the time, if we have a decent team that knows how to play(not surrending in 20 min) I do the most Minion and Player damage, the most tower damage, the most damage taken of all roles except for support. I will go up againt Bellona, or SWK and usually beat them to pheonix. I understand that AMC isn't the best for team fights, but how often do you guys see AMC's get worked in solo lane?

I won't remove FB links, info regarding public officials, etc. It's the job of admins if they want to censor the users, not moderators. As I read the rules ... contact info for public officials is fine. Info easily googlable about that public official is fine. If admins do not like it, remove it. I won't.

Atleast you should understand, how it is likely to be used? No, IE is not showing this. Stop with the offensensitivity. Also what's wrong with you - get AdBlock.

It's also incredibly strong and non conductive. It's terrific for wire management. Everyone uses hot glue. Even boeing uses hot glue. Think about that next time you're on a plane.

I've put a dent into Voyager, Neelix's jealousy is getting annoying He's basically all the things I hate about myself when I'm in a relationship, what with the jealousy, paranoia, and constant worry. Not to the extreme that Neelix takes it, but he basically acts out the little things that lurk in the back of my mind. Is this a running theme throughout the series? Or does he eventually chill/ruin everything, and the relationship between him and Kes loses that vibe?

Also ""you don't get enough carbs"" -- I am not low carbing! I had sushi for lunch for christ sake with one of these girls, she just saw me eat a bunch of Nigiri sushi, that has rice!!"

Jackfruits are absolutely tremendous, reaching a maximum size of about 80 pounds. There are people who make a living selling fresh chunks of jackfruit, and it's probably a very tough living. It's not like the thief took a couple of apples or starfruit, it's probably more analogous to having livestock stolen. For one of these small jackfruit sellers, losing a couple of jackfruits - ~150 pounds of fresh fruit - is probably a huge deal.

0	I would also recommend the awper to retreat towards T spawn, because if CTs will decide to save in the middle of rotation, they will most likely stay closer to their own spawn.	Try not to let the AWP'er exit bombsites alone I've seen it happen way too often on all kinds of ranks. Done it myself as well. You successfully take and hold a bombsite as Ts, the CTs are saving and occasionally waiting for exit frags. You all start leaving the bombsite through all the different exits, to reduce the possibility of a ninja defuse. The guy with the AWP goes off by himself, there's a guy waiting around the corner, kills him, free AWP for the CTs, reks your team the next round with it. Not to mention the money your team loses with the investment you have to make again and you possibly won't even have the option to buy another one the round after either. Just a little thought I'd share since it happened to our team the other day again. If you have the AWP, ask for someone to back you up (if there's enough of you alive) when leaving a site or, in some cases, if there is no other option and you do have to go off by yourself, make sure you choose a way that there is almost definitely no CT. You win the round and your concentration can dip those last few seconds. Sometimes these tiny errors can decide whole matches!

1	You sound pleasant person	It sucks how I can't be too nice to any men. A rant: Backstory: I'm a vendor that's been working with a restaurant for the past 2 years. Workers there come and go but there's an old man that's been there the entire time. Once, a long time ago, he asked me if I would put songs on a mp3 player for him. I told him ~~hell~~ no and that he needed to learn to use a computer himself, to which he didn't like, but I don't care because I can take or leave the guy. The other day I was getting ready to take off and he comes up to me asking me questions (english isn't his first language and like I said, I can take or leave the guy so I just wanted him to go away the entire time) to which I act friendly enough. He starts feeling my arm, saying I must have big muscles, then he starts trying to pull me in for a kiss. I was at work so I couldn't strangle his stupid ass like I would've liked, but I made it clear he's dead to me. This isn't the first time this has happened. Some men just come to the conclusion that I'd have anything to do with them just because I'm polite. And it's not always old men either, guys have beckoned me over for whatever reason and then have leaned in for a kiss *as* I'm telling them I want nothing to do with them. I should just tell them the truth, I'd never consider dating an old man. I think old men are disgusting. They should stick with women their own age. Young women who are into old men have issues or they want their money when they die. Old, broke-ass men that chase after young women are fucking pathetic. No guy, I don't want to get to know you, I don't even want to expend the energy it would take to remember your name. I'd rather go back to before I was burdened with your existence, I miss that, please let me relive that time once again. I swear to all that's holy, I take the time to make myself look as ratchet as possible and I *still* can't get men to leave me alone. I could cover myself with literal feces and will still get hit on by at least one fucking homeless guy. What do I have to do?!? I don't want to assume every man is like that because it's not true. But when I have to look at the ground everywhere I go because merely making eye contact for even one second is enough to get me followed around an entire grocery store (and I see you, motherfucker, you think you're slick but you're as plain as day, do you think I'm stupid or blind?!) what choice do I have but to put up my defenses? I need a really big fucking dog to take around with me or something...

0	"Well you did say ""I am that good player"" who gets put with the average players, so it's your fault then if you lose since you're the highest player, the kills should be easy for you right?"	Bungie needs to learn how to balance teams. The crucible is almost unplayable because of this. Without fail there is almost always a team with one really good player and the rest of the team is really bad vs a team of average to good players. More often than not, I'm that good player. I'm sick of this and I'm many others are too. I should NOT have 90% of my teams points and be losing by such large margins simply because my team can't kill things. If you are SO adamant on giving us SBMM at least balance the teams fairly instead of how you currently balance them.

IIRC though, there's an option to set the controller to be seen as a guitar controller in PCSX2. I remember it working just fine with a 360 controller on one of last year's builds.

1	Working at a car was around christmas is fun!	"My day was awesome. how was yours? Two happy things happened to me today. A friend invited me over to spend christmas with is family so I wouldn't be alone and the gift from my secret santa arrived today. People at work love to tease me and finding out that I was participating in an online secret santa gave them lots of fodder. They had never heard of Reddit before I spoke of it and consider it just another ""outandoutann is weird"" thing. I put my work address for secret santa and received the package today. Everyone was shocked and excited when the front-desk secretary called to say there was a package for me. I LOVE my gift, It's exactly the kind of thing I love and everyone agrees that it's the perfect gift cause it's so me. I can't stop smiling. Also, I was sure I would have to spend Christmas alone. Two other families had already invited me to spend it with them but I wasn't sure I wanted to. One family is very religious and I'm sure they will want to go to church etc. I'm an agnostic atheist and I'm not against church but I don't want to spend Christmas in one. The other is the family of an ex-boyfriend of a friend. I'm not close to him, don't know his family and they live far away. I was going to stay at home but the friend I spent last Christmas with invited me to join him again this year and I'm stoked. My day was awesome, how was yours?"

If a national or international company does something bad, it will affect millions of consumers, but it will often take an extremely dedicated and expensive effort to discover exactly what they've done. If tort recoveries are capped, then there is less incentive for plaintiffs to bring the companies to justice, and less incentive for companies to actually fix the problems with their products rather than just paying settlements to the people they hurt.

They never banned people from breaking ToS. And Blizzard doesn't immediate banhammer everyone who breaks ToS, they always get warnings and second chances because they're essentially kicking people out of their player-base which loses them money. Botting was 100% against ToS in hearthstone, but Shaman bots were everywhere. Sure, the accounts got banned temporarily, but they did not lose any cards, gold, experience, or golden avatars they obtained by botting. Just lost the ability to continue botting and playing for a week or two.

0	It depends on jurisdiction, but the SPCA will have the appropriate connections with law enforcement that investigates animal abuse.	Three things about this post are very disturbing: 1. They knew what hotel you were at very quickly after you returned. So either they're monitoring you directly or indirectly, either way that's deeply troubling. Did you ever figure out whether there's something on your car or phones? 2. They're not respecting the TPO. 3. Your dogs were definitely poisoned. Especially if they died at the same time, that's a huge and terrifying red flag. Please contact whatever state agency you need to in order to get the proper autopsy that can be used in court. Consult your lawyer if necessary. You need to keep any letters or other things they give to you as evidence. You don't have to read them, but give them to your lawyer. They may admit guilt or other things but you definitely don't want to be accused of destroying evidence. You and your husband need to treat every encounter with these people as potentially life-threatening. If you see them, go to the nearest group of people and call the cops. Do not engage them, do not give them any ammunition or ability to claim that they were defending themselves, or the satisfaction. Your husband really hurt your case, here. I personally think that your husband is being an idiot. Unless there's some kind of complicated custody issue at play, he needs to realize that his other child is safe with his ex for now and his current wife and new children are literally under threat for their life. Forcing you to stay around because he wants to see his other child is selfish and demonstrates a lack of basic concern for your well being. Surely going away for a few weeks or months while the protection orders are finalized is going to be understood by everyone involved.

I think you want a team that has a good TV broadcast, history of winning, ownership willing to spend, and passionate fanbase. Don't think you can go wrong with any of your choices, really, but the AL East in general always has a high level of competition - Blue Jays and Orioles are good right now, and Rays have had some success in the recent past. Dodgers and Giants are both good clubs, but their division is generally pretty awful. Washington Nationals might be another option. Bryce Harper is arguably baseball's best player, have a former Cy Young winner on the pitching staff and Strasburg has a small shot at the award this year. Depending on how things shake out with MASN they may have more money to spend in the next few years as well.

0	What is Moncada's targeted future position in Boston?	If there is any way to do a deal that doesn't include Betts, Bogaerts, Swihart, E-Rod, Devers, Espinoza, Moncada then I take it in a heart beat. I don't think Athletics want Bogaerts because they have a million short stops and they would want someone with more years of control I would think. Same could go for Mookie. Stephen Vogt is their catcher for a while, so maybe they wouldn't want Swihart. So if it's possible without the guys I mentioned, you do it. If you need one of them, I'd debate which one to give up.

0	Damnit don't bring logic to the feels.. :P	Well odds can be cut down a lot. If two people are from the same country and meet each other, that brings it down from 7 billion to a few hundred million. And the fact that they are romantically interested in each other increases the chances that they are a) from similar social class b) within the same generation c) live in the same geographic area. When you are little or a young person, the time that you vacation and travel is seasonal and coincides with school. The amount of travel destinations is relatively small; a small handful of destinations in a small handful of countries and cities. When you are on vacation you take *hundreds* of pictures, when it's a spot like the Eiffel tower, it's a big lawn where hundreds of tourists are taking pictures. So the situation is as follows: I married one of the thousands of people who grew up within 100 miles of me, and happened to be vacationing in the same highly popular tourist destination during the small window of time most people have to be vacationing. Also our families could afford to vacation abroad in the first place, which increases our chances of being downselected to one of a very small number of universities. One of us happened to be in the field of view of one of the cameras during the thousands of pictures we, or our parents, or our siblings took during one of our many vacations to a small selection of locations.

0	This sounds like the intro to a movie.	Tribes are an emerging form of society created by global communications. In ancient times, a tribe was a group of families linked by common fate - survival - and led by its strongest warrior. Then the tribe conquered others tribes, the strongest warrior became a king, who was later replaced by a republic or an empire as governance became more sophisticated. But within these kingdoms and empires, other institutions and organizations emerged by common fate - the church, the guilds, corporations, etc. They could only remain institutions as long as they had a working system of communication. Eventually the state overcame them all and WWII happened. Now that communications are completely open, common fate groups are reorganizing at a rapid pace. Confederations of these groups might emerge as well, and then they will have substantial power available to deploy - power equal or greater than some states'. It will be an incredible opportunity.

But the cop is a civilian too, being a cop it seems you get all of the benefits of joining the military without the self sacrifice of actually serving your country. Police should have their own judicial system similar to the UMCJ. Guilty until proven innocent. Police get all of the benefits (plus some) of being a military member, but are dealt with in normal courts. I don't know, this is just a rant, but when the states attorney and the police are on the same side it just begs for corruption. This is just my opinion based upon going through the legal system on both sides (civil) and seeing the UMCJ is efficient and deterrent to people who would break the law in the armed services.

There are lots of posts about people being disappointed with the Steam sale. Now I'm not being deliberately confrontational or trolling here, but I'm happy with my purchases, and am wondering if anyone else is? Stats: - My wishlist contained 20 items (I did have more, but I stripped it down to the ones that I was positive I'd actually buy) - 2 items not yet released - 16 of these items on sale in total - 10 of these items on sale at 50% or better So I bought those 10 on 50%+ sale. Which is pretty good, IMHO. 9 games and 1 DLC. I don't care about flash sales or mini games or trading stuff, just the actual games themselves. While I've been a Steam user for less than 2 years, I've been building up my collection through the Humble Bundles since 2010. Am I an anomaly? Could it be because I tend to prefer indie games over AAA?

1	Ok you are right, Edmonton is different.	Calgary's market is very different. Similar to Toronto and Vancouver, much of their assessment growth was coming from condos in gentrified areas.

The Nexus 6P 32GB comes at 74,800JPY ($610) versus $500 at the US store. An increase of $110! The only difference is the radios. Anyone knows why?
0	The math actually supports the former, not the latter.	But that's just it. An aces defense dice are more important than your attack dice. Would you rather have 3 attack dice on Soontir who has 4 defense dice or 2 attack dice on him when he only has 3 defense dice and you have a guaranteed crit? I think it's a little ridiculous they made this card when outmaneuver exists, is more expensive, is harder to use, and does less.

1	Devalues my bot farm.	Make voting in polls require 1k total level. At the moment I believe there is no level requirement to vote which seems the best way to do it unless you account for bot farmers who have a massive advantage over regular players, that's hundreds if not thousands of false votes. And by adding it the majority of dedicated players who actually spend a good amount of time playing the game will be heard rather than those who join for a month and know little to nothing about recent updates. I just don't want to see a few bot farmers controll our game. Alternatively make it so it's 1 vote per Ip this also would prevent people with multiple accounts from voting on all of them. The system seems fair atm but unless you take into consideration people will take advantage of having multiple accounts or bot farmers to abuse the system to work in their favor.

0	in short, you were a teenager and now you are not.^^	I used to be pretty music elitist. For me it was a social anxiety thing; I'd always be afraid that people would make fun of me for listening to pretty out there stuff, so I spent a lot of time thinking about how to defend my taste and cultivating disdain for the type of music that I figured that kind of jerk would listen to. I'm glad I've matured, it eventually hit me that liking 'shallow' or simple music isn't all that different from liking cheesy action movies or procedural crime shows. Just because something isn't groundbreaking or vastly different doesn't mean that it doesn't have a lot to be enjoyed and appreciated. My mom doesn't like horror movies, I don't like historical fiction, neither of us are wrong. People look for different things in what they choose to enjoy.

0	Thanks, that actually helps a lot.	I've sold on ticket exchange, stubhub, ebay and craigslist. In order of ease for the seller: 1) Ticket Exchange. Whole transaction is automatic. Fees are vulgar though I think 10% for seller plus 16% for buyer.. ugh 2) Ebay. I've made a couple deals on there and what's great about it is that there is an interface to haggle/exchange offers. I just transfer the tickets thru the Niners interface to the buyer and I'm done. 3) Craigslist: I do get a lot of tire-kickers asking about tickets and not following through, but when you make a deal it is easy - paypal for elecytronic ticket exchange. But it is the highest maintenance due to bumping ads all the time and dealing with insincere tire-kickers. 4) Stubhub. I fvkking hate Stubhub for Niners tickets, because I can't complete the transaction until the week of the game when I upload the tickets. The lowest option for Niners tix with the print delay. They need to get a robot to accept a ticket transfer on behalf of the seller and then PAY the man. Until then, Stubhub is dead to me. 5) This message board and others like it. Just no traffic.

1	Now I started to dislike you, why kill the innocent arsonist?	"So, I was McCree the Executioner, except my target died N1. I decided to play it as your average annoying bad player in the hopes of looking kinda suspicious. Except I kept getting blackmailed. The second day I was blackmailed, we woke to find the Blackmailer dead. For some reason, a random townie asks my role and starts accusing me. The Town puts me up on the stand and eventually concludes that I'm blackmailed and innos me. Next day, Amnesiac remembers as Blackmailer. Well heck. Town get suspicious of me again and demand my role, I say Sheriff and pull up a bad fake will. With Spy, Spy and Sheriff already dead I was hoping to look very suspicious with my ""easy"" TI claim, except it didn't work. They voted inno. I was so upset. The next day I get blackmailed *again* but not nightkilled. What the heck? There's now only five people left - me, three Mafias, and an Arsonist. I don't know which is which. One person asks for my role. I can't respond. Then a couple of them say that ""yeah mccree is arso"". I realised that they weren't joking. They actually thought I was the Arsonist. And then they voted guilty on me, joking all the while that ""we know you're not bm'd"" ""i'm amne you're lying lol"". I quickly typed up a thank-you note to the Mafia in my will, getting it done just before the judgement time ended. Everyone voted guilty. Imagine the collective meltdown when ""The Jester will get their revenge from the grave!"" notification showed up. It was utter *chaos*. Mafia were flipping out because they got it wrong, and the dead (who'd suspected me of being evil from the start according to Medium #2) were all screaming in caps lock at the plot twist. I ended up working out who the Arso was that night and haunting them. Mafia might've fucked up on the whole ""lynching the right person thing"" but they still helped me look suspicious and got me on the stands three times before finally lynching me. And I got the ""haunting the Arso"" achievement, too!"

1	Yes for the sake of your argument everyone is supposed to know exactly what you're talking about before you say it.	"I'm worried about a democracy that elects people into power in obviously undemocratic ways. I do not intend to waste any time on talking about monarchies. That's a whole other thing. We do not have any monarchs with actual power left in any meaningful countries in Europe. But now that you made it clear that you need me to talk about this, here you are. Monarchies were abolished for reasons in many European states after WW1 and before, by the people. Germany, Austria, France, in some ways the UK are examples for this. And if you're trying to tell me that it was not obvious that I was talking about democracies when I said ""father and son has not happened"", then... man, I don't even know what to say. If you however know that it was obvious (which I think you do) and you bring this up as a stupid-a** argument against my statement, then man, there were enough good points against what I said in all comments posted before yours. Find something better to do. It's not like most of the arguments which make sense have already been stated in the comments."

1	No that doesn't sound like abuse to me.	"Commish started Jake Locker(IR) on Thursday, then switched him out yesterday for Alex Smith. Abuse? Our 8 team league of friends has become pretty competitive in the last few weeks, despite the fact that we aren't playing for money. The commish is leading the league at 7-3. Two teams are 6-4 two teams are 5-5, two at 4-6, then taco at 3-7. Only 4 teams make the playoffs, so every game counts down the stetch. On Thursday the commish started Locker, which had several of us saying ""Lol wtf?"" but it happened. He got 0 pts and we all thought ""Hey that sucks for him, but it might help open the playoffs a bit."" Then Friday morning he switches out Locker for Alex Smith. Our point is that (1) He had all week to set his lineup. (2) It sets a bad precident. His point is that (1) Yahoo shouldnt start guys on IR. (2) He ""would do he same for us"". Side note: The league taco is on a two game winning streak despite starting his players on bye week. He is now 3-7 and beat the commish last week while starting Alex Smith."

There are many cultures, and I don't think we should destroy them as there is a lot to learn about social psychology, history, propoganda etc. It doesn't limit anything, but instead frees people to have a real working knowledge of the universe around them.

0	This actually makes me really happy - a bunch of your descriptive roleplay stuff (like the clothing shop) were really tingly for me, so I'm glad that's what you'd continue to want to make!	"This sounds self-involved, because it is! But I won't make videos that don't speak to my experience of ASMR. The only guide I have for videos is my intuition. That doesn't mean I don't take requests and listen to lots of feedback. It doesn't mean that I only make videos featuring my own most powerful triggers. But I won't do a video if it isn't feeling natural to me that day, that week, or ever. I don't think it will ever feel natural to me to make an entire video of inaudible mouth sounds. But some people get tremendous comfort from that. Some days I am not in the right place to do an ear-to-ear video. Some days personal attention videos just don't come out authentically. So, even if I have a video planned, and even if I have a hundred requests for a specific kind of video, I won't do it until I know I can enjoy doing it and do it right. Part of ASMR is affectation--we all know and embrace that. But, and I'm sure other creators will agree--we have to be comfortable sharing facets of ourselves with many, many people. It can be hard, because I'm a pretty obvious people pleaser. If I post a role-play, a lot of comments will say, ""I really like your rambles better."" If I do a whisper, many people say, ""I like your soft-spoken videos much more."" So I catalog feedback very carefully, but must resist the urge to please every one every time. But the one request I'll never take is the one where I have to force myself through. I've tried before and the videos just don't work at all. But I might try it again in a week and really love it. I guess what I mean is, even though a big part of ASMR is role-play and a little razzle dazzle, there's a big difference for me between pretending and faking. If I'm going to act like a complete dweeb, I want to do it with heart :)"

0	That's the first thing that popped up into my head when I saw that idea too, as much as I like variation in maps, I do still prefer to keep the core mechanics in place.	I was the one who started the conversation on that post about the camera. Ha
1	In Oklahoma, no less.	Who would have thought that racism and ignorance would go together like that...
0	"You consider an unsolicited email a ""barrage""?"	Define spam. To me it is a barrage of advertising but should we expect that definition to be expanded to include anything the mods simply don't like?

0	April 24th Game of Thrones comes back on	Pls be true. I've been looking for a good incest story
0	Now that's what I would call A Series of Unfortunate Events :P	Normal. One time baby boy screamed like that and woke me up. It startled me so bad I screamed in reaction, which woke up Daddy yelling which got the dog barking and at attention which REALLY woke up baby boy. It took forever to put him back down!
0	I remember freeze framing through that scene because I wanted to see what all he had in his fridge...I don't know why I wasn't expecting rows of vials, but it was clear as day what they were	In the full version of this you can see his vials when he opens his fridge. Obviously Cutler did not prepare at all for this
1	If you're depicting him for his kind in being racist, that makes you racist too.	Okay now you're being racist!

0	Seems to be the case of a lot of games which feature the theme of artificial intelligence... *glares daggers at ME3 ending*	"My biggest problem with Shaun's stubbornness has more to do with how I couldn't ask obvious questions and at least hear his reasoning. Stubbornness without explanation is a narrative brick wall, it doesn't feel like a person is stubborn. It feels like the story needed him to be, so he is. It's harder to accept. I could never ask Shaun, ""why do you believe synths can never have free will? I've seen it several times."" That felt like a glaring omission."

0	Definitely, there would be less salt and deflect would be easier to play around if the animation actually represented its size.	I don't consider myself qualified enough to say what the size SHOULD be, but I definitely feel like whatever the size is, the visuals should match up to it as closely as possible. Balance aside, this kind of behavior needlessly adds to the learning curve for newer players in a way that's not very intuitive.

0	Young voters will be thanking their grandparents in 20 years that they chose to remain a sovereign nation.	Young people overwhelmingly voted to stay (~61%), older voters chose to leave. Something about that rubs me the wrong way. Not saying that older folks shouldn't have a vote obviously, but something about the motives behind their choice.

0	Dark times ahead	I don't think rules change but the subreddit definitely will. Shitposts will start first and in a week or so you'll see speculative posts on next season pop up ever more frequently followed by even more shitposts. Every parcel of news will be argued over, reposted and argued over again and by the time you're strongly considering unsubbing it'll hopefully be time for the pre-season tests.

1	But, I've been lifting for two whole months and I haven't seen any results on the retarded lifting program that I made up and I need an edge!	I wonder how many people on here who take such supplements actually have a decent diet and are at least truly intermediate lifters. It's not worth your money or time. If you haven't sorted out all the basics, spend less time on supplement sites and more time in the kitchen and gym.

1	Porsches and Mercedes HQ are in Stuttgart tho	This is really frustrating. Tons of celebrities call Atlanta home. Atlanta is a huge town now for music, movies, tv shows, and business. There has to be a reason both Porsche and Mercedes moved their head quarters to Atlanta. Right now There are 57 movies and shows being filmed in Georgia. The best part is we have a great economy, great living conditions, and contrary to popular belief we have great fans. Our fans are begging for a big star to pick Atlanta. With the new Falcons stadium Atlanta is going to get a lot of high profile events. I think he would be smart to come here and be the star that helps Atlanta win a championship.
1	Yeah that alone would make her a pretty terrible president and person.	God, I hope Hillary doesn't actually listen to Kenny G.
0	You're just another example of a brain dead leftist.	It's pretty clear to you maybe, but it sure seems to be moral to me. Discrimination is immoral. Also, if you think Disney needs money, you live under a rock.
0	Not really an apples to apples comparison, as the phantom camera is designed for video, whereas the original just shot a sheet of film, but for something moving that fast a 2 microsecond exposure would get a *much* clearer image than a still from 170,000fps video, even if it was recording in 1080p	Bear in mind that a camera recording at 1,000,000 fps playing back at 25 fps would make one millisecond over a minute long. Recording at 170,000 fps at a resolution of around 480p would show a similar result to the image shown, as it would make one second in real time last 6800 seconds (if I've done that right)

0	Veterans lying about their service is common.	My dad said he was a veteran but apparently isn't... My father passed away almost a year ago, just shy of his 65th birthday. He always told us while growing up that he was a Marine and did two tours in Vietnam, amongst other now apparent lies (maybe?)... I am also a Marine, seven years and counting. I went home recently on leave for a friend's wedding and saw paperwork from the VA that my mom had requested. His SRB was there. I found the last entry that designated his transfer into the reserve, and that entry listed his awards at that time. A National Defense, and a Meritorious Mast. Three years of active service out of six required by contract and from what I can see he never went any farther west than Kadena. I am pretty blown away and have no idea what to think. He always told us he had PTSD and his alcoholism was part of that. Now it is clear to me that he was a Vietnam Era Veteran, and could wear the Vietnam Service ribbon (like I am a part if the Global War on Terrorism and wore that ribbon before I deployed for the first time) but he never could wear the campaign medal because he never spent time in country. I guess I am posting to vent a little, but also because I am hoping someone out there will help me understand this. Maybe it is common to talk up your service a little bit but I can't understand any of this.

1	Yeah but Podolski and Campbell are really good I can understand why Wenger doesn't give them more minutes	Arseblog points out today that our loanees Podolski, Sanogo and Campbell have scored a grand total of 0 league goals for their current clubs. I haven't checked appearance and minutes data for all of them, but know Sanogo has been injured and benched a lot, though Campbell has had 15 appearances. I guess Podolski is out. Sanogo seems like a pet project for Wenger, so let's give him the benefit of the doubt. Campbell has been on perma-loan, yet signed a new contract before leaving (the cynics view is that it was to give him resale value). Any other comments?

Very few people are going to feel Euphoria even when we reach the previous ATH. We've been grizzled and a lot of us are still quite upset to be so far below our composite buy-in levels that we aren't going to be settling for anything less than moon at this point.
0	And that's why this is a shitpost worth downvoting.	The two 'old' designs are the same setting, the right window opens when you click adjust on the left window. The middle window/popup(modern design) is the popup for changing the time, the window behind it is just the settings page. Yes, there are two different styles used in windows, modern design and the default win32 design. That is not really nice but I'm pretty sure there isn't a quick solution for it(since modern design is new and the rest is kind of redundant but needed for backwards compatibility and fallback until they have moved everything to the new framework)

1	Thanks I've never heard any of this before...............	I'm surprised you guys are judging Benoit so hard. The guy had so many concussions and TBIs that its fairly obvious he was having behavioral problems that were out of his control. I'm on mobile so i cant link it at the moment but a neurologist that studied his brain said that Benoit's brain resembled that of an 85 year old Alzheimer's patient. All of his years of wrestling really fucked him up and he was practically running on autopilot for what would have been a while before his murder suicide. We are at a time when we are finally beginning to understand the severity of TBI influence on behavior and suicidal ideation. Check out the ongoing research on NFL players with concussions and their subsequent behavior, and then realize that wrestlers are subject to that much more abuse on an ongoing basis. You guys are acting as if you're doing someone a favor in calling him out as a murderer when the situation is obviously much more complicated than that.

I've done a lot of research on critiques, but I've found it hard to find good arguments for it. Actually, I've had some trouble finding arguments for it, period. However, if you think you can knock it out of the park by arguing against, go ahead. Just as a suggestion, I think explaining the effectiveness of Keynesian policy as much as possible without empiricism will do you the most good. Anybody can find a case study that ""proves"" their point, so I'd love to hear a more dialectic discussion. Once again, though, if you think you've got THE piece of evidence, then lay it on us without hesitation."

1	Honestly, if you don't see an image of a woman chained up like a dog, forced to wear a metal bikini while a pervert drools over her empowering, that sounds like a personal problem.	"Okay... I'm going to wade into this. Feel free to disagree, but I'm going to try and lay some things out for those who don't see what the issue is. I grew up with the original trilogy. I saw ROTJ before puberty, and my friends and I were mesmerized by Leia. There was the one kid who insisted that his cousin had a Kenner Slave Leia action figure. Dammit, I wanted that figure too! (For those of you who don't know, there wasn't one. It was just myth until the 90s.) So, Slave Leia became a thing. The Friends episode from the 90s actually captured some of the allure of this outfit. But then I had to go ruin it all by having kids. Yup, I have daughters, and a lot of this slave Leia stuff bothers me. Part of the problem is that by focusing on this outfit, it undercuts Leia's agency in the film. In ROTJ, she puts her life on the line to save her boyfriend's life, gets captured, but then strangles the slimy dude who captured her. Take that. Leia's a badass. But look at this card? Do we get agency? Do we get a badass? Nope, we get submission. She's looking down, she's chained. We don't get Leia the ass-kicker, we get Leia lounging and showing off her body. And Topps is tellings us that Leia, posed thusly, will ""capture our attention."" But I do acknowledge that this scene happened, and does indeed make sense in the context of the story. My preference? Skip this card. Maybe acknowledge the outfit by using a shot where she is *doing something*. Strangling Jabba, shooting the sail barge gun, or even swinging to safety again. The real problem is what this outfit has become, outside of the movie. Go google ""slave leia art"" or ""slave leia fan art."" Umm... wow. Those images do not convey the picture of a leader, of a woman who went to save her boyfriend who got his ass frozen and hung on the wall in some backwater in the outer rim of the galaxy. That is a woman who exists to fuel our fantasies. That is my problem with this card, it hews too close to that Leia, rather than the badass that she could be. I'm not upset, but I'm not pulling this card. That's all. I just wanted to give you guys some context why people might have a problem with it."

Arbitration is NOT based on law by is 100% legally binding in almost all cases. This prevents the city from firing police officers.

Then I read the rest of their comments and feel no desire to give them such benefit.
0	If you could link to that research, either here or in a new post, that would be awesome.	The current research either describes us as over-empathizing or as possessing empathy while others possess a simulation of it, the reason is that we have been shown to still have emotional contagion (the sort of empathy you see in fiction, otherwise it's only seen in babies). In essence we absorb and feel the emotions of those around us without recognizing what's internal and what's external, there are exceptions to this but most of those are when the other party is also in the spectrum and even then we still feel a good portion of it. To complicate matters even more, although this has really only been shown anecdotally, we speak a different emotional language so our displays of emotion are lost on NTs just as many of theirs are lost on us if we haven't learned to read them but autistics can read each other. Unfortunately a large portion of our emotional language seems to be based in our capacity for empathy which makes it almost impossible for NTs to even approach fluency thankfully theirs is easy enough to learn that it can help bridge the gap.

0	He says he's paying off current debts, it sounds like the current situation is temporary.	OP, this is great and shows that your job is paying well. But, the question has to be why are you struggling? You are earning above the average for a UK couple, even more so for your age group. People are picking on vaping ect and telling you to stop, thats probably not necessary, but if you are struggling on this income you really need to sit down and budget a limit for these and other expenditures. You also need to think long term. If your GF wants kids your pattern of work becomes a problem. It might feel early to discuss that but you both need to know what the aim of this relationship is. It might be that the job is right for now but that its more acceptable if you are willing to transition for other future commitments.

0	"You can use a computer to do unauthorized things, but there is no ""unauthorized way"" to use a computer."	"There isn't ""*THE* new definition,"" i.e., one. The U.S. government defines hacker as anyone using a computer in an unauthorized way, which is a crime unless authorized by a government (specifically the U.S. government), in which case it's legitimate espionage or whatever. The mainstream public defines hacker as (1) anyone who's good with a computer, or (2) anyone who can circumvent a security measure. The technology community defines hacker as anyone who can use a technology in a way other than its anticipated and intended purpose. I have no idea which of these definitions you even believe to be ""*THE* definition"" of hacker."
0	You're probably still better off just getting a ps2, and sticking with a ps3 slim, which are going to be more reliable down the line.	How are the backwards compatible PS3's holding up nowadays? I see that they're not *too* expensive. Around $100. Are they worth getting, or is it better to just use a PS2? Do they have any problems, are they loud devices? If they *are* defective, is it easy to open them up and maintain them? I do so with my PS3 slim but I think it is still too loud.

0	its simple supply and demand, the demand for racism way outpaced the supply so they had to make more though.	This is so gross and desperate. They faked racism so hard during the election people had to fake racist attacks to justify it.
0	The US is on the forefront of medical research because of our our excellent postsecondary schools, not because it cost me over 40k in hospital bills for my daughters delivery last December.	Not that I'm anti single payer (I'm not) but the US style of healthcare does have medical benefits. Namely the US is on the forefront of medical research, because its so lucrative to do here. If the US went single payer, the entire world's medical costs would increase, because right how the US is disproportionately subsidizing those costs through our insane profit potential. Also the US is much better at developing and performing complicated, high risk (and very profitable) procedures. Again because the insanely high profit potential attracts people to specialize more and more and more to increase income potential. So make no mistake, if the US went to single payer (which I believe would be the best outcomes for the majority of people, which is why I support it), there would be something lost, and everybody's (but the US) costs would increase on average.

But she screamed,""JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE!!!!!"", so Junkrat heard her, and ducked behind cover. Junkrat through a concussion bomb while Pharah was getting ready to launch her helix rockets. But something was strange. Neither of them could explode/launch their explosives. And it wasn't because of any dysfunction, no, no, no, they just couldn't gather the guts to do it. They both had realized they had a strong connection, mostly with explosives. So Pharah went away, and Junkrat left the area. He couldn't betray Pharah by taking any artificial research. You choose what happens next. Write a comment! And if you can, include Roadhog somehow, because he is still Junkrat's bodyguard, and I don't know how he would fit in with this story."

Yes, I too played vanilla AV as a rogue trying to get my lobotomizer and up my rank. You kept accumulating honor as long as you stayed in. My point is that currently AV gives the exact same rewards as any other bg whether you win/lose, even if it can potentially take much longer.

I'm getting a CT scan next Thursday to see how much of my skull has disintegrated and/or if the infection is eating away at my brain. **TL;DR: My brain and skull might be melting.**

1	Yeah damn veterans and their **perks** and **pay**!	Pay is pretty damn decent when you factor in 100% healthcare coverage for whole family (you pay nothing for anything), Housing allowance, and food allowance, and a yearly small clothing allowance.
1	Maybe just give all stupid performers an EV RE-20 ... they will be very confused	It's crossed my mind before to fix barbed wire to the bottom of the cage of all my handheld mics to prevent this behaviour.
0	Agreed.	Don't read the prequel till its publication order.
1	The eye cant see when you use more than 128K ram	You won't need 256K RAM, 128K is all you need.
1	Yeah, Republicans are the party of hating veterans...that angle will surely work!	Disgusting. You guys really do hate veterans, first Kerry, then McCaine, now this? Have you no shame?
0	I seriously laughed at this for about 2 minutes straight and I have no idea why.	Hehe Jefferson-Cox, LOL Roosevelt-Tits, LMAO Kennedy-Nuts, etc...
0	Meanwhile there is a HUGE shortage in French Immersion schools...	Average Students Per School by School Districts in Metro Vancouver
0	Yes the Arabs in the picture are getting off at the concentration camp stop.	lol it's a microscosm of different Jews - doesn't Israel force deport non Jews? What a crazy policy.
1	Dario by a mile, Sebastian Saavedra is awful.	Sebastian VS Dario: who is the better driver and who's had the better career?
0	DEEPER!!!!	2 packs a day will help.
0	I don't believe that he conveniently ate the ticket nor do I believe that he was actually ticketed for Jaywalking on South St.	Maybe you didn't read his comment carefully enough, but he ate the ticket. I don't want him to post it, because it would probably be a picture of a used toilet.
0	Well I'm glad he got his gear back, back but that's fucked that they made him pay for it!	Wanted to comment on this in the other sub you posted on but I couldn't do to not enough comment karma. Best write up I've seen yet lmao but good advice! I read a post earlier about a guy who got a legal Chem seized (I think it was etiz, the story is in other rc sub) and the package got delivered empty with a letter from ICE about ten months ago and then last month they wrote him back saying chemicals were found to be legal and he could pay to get them back!
1	yep, my fault, should have seen this coming, i'm holding it wrong	Same reason your house didn't come with a broom.
0	And I dare anyone to explain why he downvotes the parent.	When you think it's alright that cilvilians killed that soldier, why are you upset when civilians use carbombs against american soldiers in Aghanistan? It's just the same old story with a different name......
0	To be fair it's not unusual for someone to take a mini step in the opposite direction to push off to the direction they want to go.	My whole issue with it, is that it wasn't an accident. If you watch the video he side steps into the field before jumping out of the way. If you're standing straight up and try to jump out of the way of someone, you don't need that additional step. He was trying to make it look like an accident. You won't see a head coach happy after a 70 yard run back like him. It was just completely classless.
0	ripped 3 BV chars from 820.... and i warned them :D	You think the Shaper is scary?
1	No Inferno, no king of banana.	Friberg the last 18 matches
1	A new shoe?	Look what came in the mail today!
1	I've never seen such a legit news site.	World War III - The New Axis of Evil
1	Yes, I guess that's why Las Vegas has abolished all dice games.	I dunno about that. With the right mathematics, you could predict what side the dice will land on. Most likely humanly improbable, but not impossible. For true Random Number Generation, there can't be any arbitrary constraints such as limiting what numbers can be selected (1-9) or using any sort of order or logic, which already defies how the human mind works as well as modern computers.
0	If kappy were here, he'd get the puck out of the zone :(	End of period, finish all beers in sight and then do whatever like fix your balls/boobs and lets goooooooing
1	And because the press in India is known for its exceptional fairness and being objective.	Because news reports are not anecdotal ever.
1	yeah i hate it when video games are unrealistic	A glorious absence of concealment logic.
0	To cunt Cuntar Cunto Cuntas Cunta Cuntamos Cuntan	Why did the verb ending suddenly change from -ar to -er/ir. Also I think cuntar/er/ir should be a stem changer because that's a cunt thing to do.
1	New people cannot detect	So, I'm an asshole in asking why jesus gave her cancer to begin with? Or why jesus wouldn't just remove the cancer instead of just stopping it from spreading? Seems to me that jesus is being the asshole here.....
0	Fascism is real and Trump is the leader of fascist America.	"ITT: People that hate the government interfering in their privacy but are totally okay with the government trashing civil rights ""to stop terrorism."" The cognitive dissonance is real."
1	Yea the guy working at applebees is making $100/hr.	Get off your high horse. I spent several years working in restaurants and no one was ever making less than $15 an hour after tips, sometimes its was closer to $100 an hour. Stop looking for a social cause to crusade for, there isn't one here skippy.
0	Couldbeworse54 already has that with Sherman AND AP.	Guys don't forget to draft Johnny Manziel, you want that 24/7 ESPN coverage don't you?

0	"After you ""cum lube"" stunt, I expected you to be filling your receiver with some fresh and frothy santorum."	AK-47 Filled With Silly Sludge. Will It Shoot?
0	I was gonna say the same thing, but I think this is actually in the first half hour of the second part.	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?
1	Genius	With the recent ddos of the site, you could run a crosscheck of downtime vs matches ppl lost big on. Should produce a pattern of suspects
1	great reply, really disproves my point!	Lol kk
1	Yes because drugs are really what those kids need right now.	This is incredibly sad... I can only hope her kids take on her cause with an incredible amount of passion.
1	Yeah public unions!	Denver police monitor says panel is telling cops it's OK to lie
1	ZOMG GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD THIS IS DEATH TO HUMANITY	The food of the gods
1	Do you really think I'm going to get my DD rail wet?	Rainsofting separates men from boys. Anyone willing to get mud on their gear is a true airsofter.
0	I'm with you on that, but really beer distributors and bottlers are vital in disaster relief since they have stockpiles of purified water meant for large quantity brewing.	I know its a really nice thing for them to be doing and all but im pretty sure if my town had just burnt down I would much rather a beer.
0	This message best read while listening to a jazz rift of bass and bongos, wearing a beret and drinking espresso.	ok. so what is the history? it's what people are ##guessing is the problem. it might be a food allergy is doing this to this child. it serious as a heart attack might be. so, because this child has a food allergy, we allow this fascist God damned police force to taze him, strangle him, mace him? what? the? fuck?. it might be any sort of allergen. it might be a wheat thing (i forget what that's called). it might be an allergy to some sort of meat. it's likely too much red dye in the child's candy. children are precious. no child deserves this - especially when they are acting out, because a child is acting out due to influences upon him. it could be the very air this kid is breathing. did anyone stop to consider this child is living close to a coal plant? no. no-one wants to consider the child. they just want to consider how they're going to mace the fuck out of him. well fuck you all. and if that was my child, you'd be at the bad end of a good rifle. my advice, treat the child for pinworms.
0	Think of all of the parents that didn't have to get dragged to concerts for their 9-14 year old kids.	Exacly. That's a reasonable age to start attending. Anyone below is either an annoyance to everyone else, or at risk of being trampled.
1	thanks for circling it, would never have noticed otherwise	TIL ROBLOX's total RAP is R$15,331,399
0	Incoming cock!	Let me jump this pogo stick onto your dinner, WCGW?
0	I think after Aliens 3	When is the District 9 sequel coming?
1	"He's just mad because he ""hates everything about life""."	Well I've been watching his vids for like a month now, and he genuinely seems like a pretty nice guy. Also very good at simplifying and explaining...
1	Well I sure hope we buy another CM instead of a CB to keep up with them.	Real Madrid officially sign Isco
0	then it could be worth it - but I'd want to make sure it's a surefire RB1 because Marshall is a damn valuable WR	PPR. That's why I'm considering this. All three get so many targets.
0	I hope there is a pretty hefty fine for people caught doing this	Whitebaiters are pouring cooking oil into Christchurch's Avon River to make it easier to fish
1	Yeah stop using a weapon that has been a part of every FPS since ever you useless fuck.	Get off the roofs and stop sniping.
0	i like to think we might be the only sane people in an insane world	There are tons of theories. Some of them are total BS Most of the current information points to it being a genetic disorder. There isn't enough good information out there yet.
0	the free agent crop this year mainly for forwards is better than years past	Haahah, this list just feels like they added a whole bunch of filler to try and generate some clicks. Subban, Bobrovsky, Taylor Hall, c'mon... It's like they're trying to create free agent frenzy whenever an important date comes up.
