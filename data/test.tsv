3	I imagine they are small marks and if you weren't looking for them wouldn't see them.	Yeah, I don't think I have ever noticed any chalk marks.
4	Yeah, me too...I didn't enjoy it much, although I do enjoy them seperately	I honestly really hope that Sweetz is /not/ in fact hinting at Burial's future 'avant-garde` sound
5	If a frog had wings it wouldn't bump his ass when he hops	None of this matters if Trump wins Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.
6	can't watch it and get into heaven son, that's stealing :(	You are on the internet, you can watch everything somewhere.
7	I don't really know the exact models but have you looked at crown hookah glass bowls?	Bowl recommendations I do know about the wiki, but I'm looking for something fairly specific. I want a bowl that holds less than 20 grams with a fairly average pack, and doesn't ghost flavors (which sadly disqualifies basically every stone/clay bowl). I would absolutely love the Onyx bowl but as we all know it's constantly out of stock. Anything else that fits that criteria? Seems like every bowl is 25-30g these days. :(

13	By Trump-Logic, as displayed many times, that number is actually 8 million votes.	Kyle Griffin on Twitter: "Clinton's popular vote margin is now 2.83 million, more than 5.2 times the margin Al Gore had in 2000."
14	Good Rexy.	LeSean McCoy out of practice again on Thursday

17	I cursed you	Loki. I started out as Thor, but wanted a more stealthy God to play, so I got suggested to try Loki. He did end up as my first diamond, so that's great and all.
18	True, but that also costs a couple of cards	Or superior energy retrieval

23	Payback for Wade shooting the lights out last week	(Washburn) Amir Johnson hit four 3-pointers in his first SEVEN NBA seasons. He has four in the 3Q tonight. #Celtics #Bulls
24	I'm not gullible enough to take the word of something he wrote in a book so there's that	God damn you are gullible. Btw, you don't know how taxes work. For the simple minded though: He gets audited every year and has yet to go to prison for tax evasion, which is the end of the discussion ultimately. Why would anyone pay more taxes then they have to? We do the best we can within the rules we are given, pretty fucking obvious/common sense business practice dontcha think?
25	I wanted to try it but the queues were so long, since it was called DODGEball, it would make more sense she could only use her 3 and 4 (less cancerous and you can dodge better)	it was actually really fun, 90% cdr, infinite mana, only use her 1 and 4, and going back to the fountain didnt restore health.
26	And then there was Mormonism	Makes more sense? It claims to be the *final* revelation, and Mo is the *final* prophet. Straight away that's an invitation to violence.
27	You mean like the women they are slut shaming for wearing 'hypersexualised' costumes?	I like how there's no "Yes" decision out of the 'picture broadcast' block. What if I'm perfectly happy having my costume plastered all over the internet and airwaves? Oh! And decision blocks should be diamonds, not rectangles. Learn to flowchart.

31	So I kind of know, would bbq pork with vinegar not work better for that region?	No but that would work for Nola. I live by the beach my flag has a palmetto tree on it.
32	Purging voters doesn't qualify?	I caucused for Bernie and he won my state. You are talking about internal party politics and we are talking about systematic voter suppression done by public officials ala Jim Crow. Very different things.

34	I'm up in Canada, so I'm just going to stay put while that man is in office...	May have to wait a while with Trump in office and the hiring freezes. Not that it was easy to get a civil servant position before that unless you were a co-op.
35	Department of ^selective Justice	Charlie Kirk: "If there was a video showing Trump calling for violence against Clinton supporters, Obama would be calling for a criminal investigation."
36	Pretty sure the term is 'house nigger', not field negro.	When blacks trash on other blacks, they are a "field negro". When white chicks dish on other white chicks, they are enlightened in their lack of privilege.
37	I think it's because you have to make them in bulk so they have to pick popular molecules.	If your t shirt, socks, coffee mug, etc. has a structure on it, it's probably either caffeine, dopamine, or THC, because people are original.

50	Its the Russians!	The right-wing has congealed around a hysterical, conspiracy theory-fueled consensus towards liberals. They believe Obama and Hillary are out to destroy the country, one health insurance registration and common-sense tax policy at a time.
51	The ones who do, live in those states like NY and CA that get less influence	How come Americans don't find that horrifying?
52	So basically you win by getting a lot more points, and your company pays the cost with an additional $200 for the ticket?	I know a lot of people have been grumbling about the new bonus category for the Platinum not living up to the hype. It actually sort of worked out well for me, because I needed a flight to San Francisco next weekend for a conference. The best part is that I get reimbursed, so can't go wrong, right? Well, I had to purchase my ticket on October 4th to confirm my attendance, but when I called the Concierge the next day to ask about retroactive credit (because the category doesn't start until today), they said that they could not extended. I even explained that I also have the PRG, and having heard about the announcement on Tuesday and thinking it couldn't have worked out any better, would otherwise have put it on my PRG. I ended up cancelling the ticket thanks to United's 24-hour cancellation policy, but the price has since jumped in the past 24 hours to about $200 more for the transcon. However, the other reason I was pushed to cancel was because some of the logistics around the conference seem a bit sketchy. * They were supposed to contact me 3 weeks out (about 2 weeks ago) confirming my attendance. They did it only two days ago. * They needed a confirmed ticket to SFO as a way to confirm attendance, which I sent them two days ago almost as soon as I received their email. * I haven't received any more email since then. My plan was to book a hotel for the weekend as soon as they got back to me, but since they haven't... Anyhow, I think it'll work out in the end. If I have to pay the higher price for a ticket, it just means more points to look forward to in the future.
53	Why have historical and scientific accuracy when you can have transphobia instead?	Transphobia and homophobia are very much related and treated very similarly socially. People also seem to forget what trans women's contribution to the stonewall riots was (as they were at the time considered gay male transvestites). Trans people have been in the gay rights movement since the very start.
54	Its actually exactly the same as other seasons and tomorrow will be a huge player massacre aswell..	cry more lol this season has been more active and has so far lasted longer than the past few
55	10 years, 10,000,000 documents, 0 corrections.	Have any of them been fake yet? Why would that change? All this says to me is that she knows more is still out there.
56	I haven't played in a while, but I think you can mark them for deletion and pause the work.	Closing houses? Hi everyone, Just as hopefully everyone else on this sub, I love this game. But I've been having some difficulties, and I'll list them off in hope that some of you can help me out... 1. Houses. In my recent game I've had a terrible starvation where 90% of my population died off. As a result, my survivors were scattered across the map. So I closed buildings in favour of bunching my people up to close walking distance. So now all my people are living in different houses close together, so instead of at least adults coupling up everyone decided they needed their own house. So now, firewood was being used at an insane rate to heat all these barely populated homes. Do I have to demolish every single house to prevent this? A feature to 'close' houses would be perfect to prevent this perhaps. 2. Maps. As a noob player I find it frustrating to get maps that are littered with hills and lakes. Perhaps it's like that to make the game more challenging but can we have some maps that are flatter (noob friendlier...) that don't force me to stretch my town across thin valleys and make forester lodges a pain in the ass to place. I know there are mods for this but vanilla features for this would be wonderful! P.S. How does everyone manage to feed their town past the 150 population point? Nothing seems to help for me.

59	I don't know, sounds like he may be too *euphoric* for us lesser beings	Bummer dude. This place isn't... you know... *enlightening*, but if you like cats or porn or talking to strangers then it is ok.
60	SS: You lost, don't ever call us again you loser and you can forget about being friends on Facebook.	Is abandon the right word here?
61	Is he also a closet homosexual in PA?	He's now a state senator.
62	151 comments and no one noticed the hypocrisy in the display featuring a representation of the human face in a religion that supposedly objects to that.	Indoctrination is a cruel form of mental child abuse any way you slice it.
63	But how'd you get Falco in 64?	I've done this in 64 well over a decade ago. It's just rare to see it in an actual match.
64	Especially if they have capped shoulders	that 90% of the bodybuilders you look up to are on steroids, set realistic goals.
65	I thought Adult Swim really was the one place that you didn't have to worry about political censorship, especially for shows after midnight, but apparently not.	What kills me is that this situation is very unlike [adult swim]. Every fucking show that challenged the norm in some way found its place in their network, and now that the "norm" is protecting people's feelings, we're never going to see anything challenging ever again
66	Hmmmm... Truth must rhyme with douche for a reason.	Lol, I've hated wikileaks from the start, however I don't believe they were linked to Russia a decade ago, they were just giant douchenozzles.
67	Yeah... The rising median wage at a time when the entire world's developed countries are seeing thay shrink is really hurting the working class...	Frankly I'm sick and tired of working class American's paying the price for these imperialist games that only benefit the rich but cost them nothing.
68	You can call Commuter Services, they will sometimes impound bikes that have been parked way too long	Beach cruisers are inherently terrible. They're not practical to ride on hills, so they end up sitting in the same spot for months taking good parking spots. Their handlebars also take up three spaces. There should be some time limit for parking a bike (2 months?) Just my opinion...
69	Can you tell me, without spoilers, why they're stopping in November 2018?	YouTube: The Great War channel. They've been producing a show every week for almost two years (100 years ago today......) and will continue until November 2018. It's binge watching at its best.
70	OK, dude...chill out!	Never EVER assume that someone would want you to take that step without asking their permission. Even if its with good intentions, ask first and let them have the chance deiced.
71	Do you happen to have any suggestions for alcoholic drinks that don't taste too alcoholic?	It also depends on what you drink. A dark beer or something is really disgusting in my opinion, but a nice cider or girly drink is great.
72	I guess its just perception but I live in the suburbs of NY and those things youve listed only further push my point.	Doesn't offer much? Oil, Mining, Fishing, (if it ever gets approved like it should have decades ago) Natural Gas, Logging, Farming (If you know what you're doing), Snow Machining, Dog Sledding, Sea Life Studying, And Hunting. This sate offers more then most places in the world do. It's expensive and cold but that's the best defense against people who are anti-progress, I just wish it worked better.
73	I would have said a big bag of wool.	What do you call a sheep with no legs?
74	"Without using traps or *abilities*"	This. I don't know why people don't take the advice, when it works and makes it a lot easier.
75	And I'm sure none of those reports are fake or staged	Reports of racist graffiti, hate crimes post-election
76	TFW you believe that all the people that hated before are now sticking up for you o3o	honestly, i don't understand why people still hate on her. she's definitely improved, and she's not shoving OCs at all. She simply wants to show her work
77	More of that famed Trump sarcasm?	Trump Says He Didn't Call Climate Change A Hoax
78	Well, I mean, there was taxes but we've moved away from that since Eisenhower, the stalwart Democrat who built our highways	I don't know how often you venture out into the wide world but for newer toll roads they just send you a bill. And by the by, how do you think you were paying for them before? Did you think the bridge and tunnel fairy just built them for free?
79	I mean, you're totally right... ...but if michigan squeaks in and wins, you better believe I'm gonna be celebrating like any other Michigan fan.	Don't put Michigan in the playoffs. Fuck that. I want them to be there. I want it so bad. I cried after Ohio beat them. But don't fucking put them in the playoff. Why do you even play the games if you're gonna award based on *perception*? Yeah, Michigan is a better team than either of the two teams in the B1G Championship Game. So what? The 07 Pats were a better team than the Giants that year, but we didn't award them the Lombardi based on the idea that they only lost because of a fluky play. So don't fucking put Michigan in the playoff. Otherwise, what's the point?
80	How did u get that kimmich?	Any improvement and upgrade suggestions please. I have roughly 50k to spend?

83	Go to the fruits and vegetable section and get an apple instead	Should I get Microsoft or Linux?
84	**NOT PAID ACTORS**	These faux-reality commercials make me hate Chevy. They are actively convincing me *not* to buy one..
85	Ahh yes, the ignorant kid with a stick up his ass that can't give credit where credit is due.	Ah yes, the good old BO3 stomp where the team that lost actually got more rounds than the winner!
86	I'm just waiting for the German redditors to tell us who this is blown out of proportions.	PSA: if your country doesnt neighbor Russia, please dont belittle those people concerns. Thank you.
87	That's because so many of them are centralized in the most expensive part of the country.	It's worth noting that American IT workers, *especially* software developers, are already paid *way* more than their counterparts in other countries, even in other developed countries. My software job here in the US easily pays twice as much as an equivalent job in any EU state. We pay a *lot*. Obviously I don't mind the extra money, but most software developers aren't paid "slave wages". That's why the median salary is nearly $100k.
88	Never said that him not saying anything made it worse, people getting angry at these people is what made it worse He didn't do anything wrong, he just couldve thought in a more positive way.	Okay but once again, how did that make it worse? You didn't actually answer the question. You just avoided it. The other guy couldn't read his mind. Not to mention he reacted just fine.
89	Are you honestly implying that no one, not even this mass murdering psychopath, deserves it?	It's thoughts like that that lead to people killing people. 'Because they deserve it'
90	Yep - it's in Leviticus - did you miss this part of early morning seminary?	So the double reed is OK in church, but not the single reed. Got it.
91	Having 2 chairs is pretty unusual.	If you hold the humorous speech competition and table topics competition at the same meeting, do you have two separate contest chairs? I'm guessing clubs usually have one contest chair for both competitions, but would it be reasonably normal to have two separate contest chairs for humorous speech and table topics separately? If I'm a contestant for the humorous speech competition, can I be the contest chair for the table topics contest? I'm trying to compete as well as get CL credit for being contest chair.
92	IT'S ONE OF ONLY A FEW SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN PEE ON YOURSELF WITH LITTLE TO NO REPERCUSSIONS, A MAN'S GOTTA LIVE A LITTLE	WHEN CARSON WENTZ PEES IN THE SHOWER, HE PEES ON HIS FEET ON PURPOSE
93	You guys are a brotherhood brotherhood sticks together	First year union apprentice laid off for three weeks. Called the hall today and was told it could be a few more weeks. What are my options? I'm hoping people here with similar experience have advice. I'm working out of IBEW local 354 and have been unemployed for three weeks and probably at least a few more. Every time I call the hall or the JATC they don't sound very sympathetic or hopeful. I'm currently getting unemployment but it barely covers my bills and my wife is starting to put the pressure on me. This is my first year in the industry so please help!
94	I don't know... He probably already offed half his army for that sick power armor.	If it were Woolie's gorilla army they wouldn't be scared of backing down as cowards and then betray their race for jetpacks at least.
95	Yeah, sending dick picks has really done wonders for Anthony Weiner's career.	Generalizing much?
96	This needs to stop.	'I'm a non-binary 10-year-old' - BBC
97	needs more spacers	My Kilo TT Stripper
98	Nothing to do with anything.	Yep, but (((their))) thought-process doesn't work that way goys... They think "we're God-chose, we're the Light unto the Nations, and besides that, the Torah says we will be persecuted throughout history, so it's expected that the goys will persecute us! When they persecute us, this means the Torah is getting fulilled and it also helps us to consolidate our tribe and not assimilate among them. Also, these idolatarian Christian Goys with reddish faces and hairs are the descendants of Edom(=red), and our Rabbi says that they're kind of like animals, barely human, and just like the wild animals don't like to have masters, these goys alike don't like to have masters! But as the Torah says, we will be masters and we will give a lot of loans to other nations, but we will take no loan. Also, the descendants o Jacob (=Jews) will destroy the descendants of Edom (=Christians) just like it's written in the Torah, and the Torah is what we repeat every day and on each prayer, so this belief is deeply embedded into our subconsciousness..."
99	His final typing is grass/ghost	Im playing now. He is definetly grass/flying
100	How many freedoms units is that?	You could walk the entirety of this 2,500 kilometer-long line that stretches halfway cross Canada without seeing virtually any signs of humanity such as roads, towns or settlements. Canada is big, folks.
101	Hindsight is 20/20!	Well, that seems so obvious on re-reading, except for not having known "overwatch" was a game lol
102	But, but, Trump and the Banana Republicans said they could.	Also the fact that manufacturing competitors like Germany and Japan are no longer reeling from post WWII economic hardship. And we're now part of a global economy. It's just not possible to put that genie back in the bottle.
103	Everyone always hopes for this and everyone is always let down.	I really hope we get a completely ruthless Vader in Rogue One, completely irredeemable at this point. I love the character when he's at his most villainous.
104	It's been adjusted... just give up on the anus obsession already!	Also options: Ahnus Annus Anuus Anuss
105	Haven't seen these exact criticisms before.	Everything Dean Ambrose does inside the ring looks utterly fake. Sorry, i just can't get behind the guy. He has great in ring psychology, a great talker, awesome energy and has the look to make it in the WWE. But inside the ring, every punch, kick, rope move, movement, it just seems completely fake and forced. Two times during the match he did that stupid 2nd rope bounce. First, it never looks real, makes absolutely no sense and takes a stupid amount of preparation to even make the move while the opponent stands there waiting for him to do it. By far the worst move in his arsenal. Every other moves just seems so... fake, like he's a bad physical actor, when i am watching guys like AJ, Seth, Jericho, i can believe that that is a real move within the WWE realm, but the ones done by Ambrose always, always look fake... Can't remember one wrestler who always seems fake. p.s. personal opinion, what do you guys think.
106	Ahh, so that was what the whole Hamilton thing was about.......	TIL A few days before delivering the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln saw John Wilkes Booth perform as a villain in a play at Ford's Theatre. Someone told Lincoln, "He almost seems to be reciting these lines to you." To which Lincoln replied, "He does talk very sharp at me, doesn't he?"
107	Straight outta goodwill	mmm boxy ill-fitting suit
108	Yeah but you can add a simple sharia law that says women must give sex to husbands, perfect!	Japan doesn't really have a problem with hookup culture, though. It's that Japanese women find the men so unappealing that they would rather remain virgins and date virtual men. Arranged marriage would just mean a lot of dead bedrooms, because the women would still find the men unappealing and unattractive.
109	That's just because you're not even a medaling hospital, gotta go with the top 3	Believe me, I work in one of the top 10 teaching hospitals in the US and they get just as lazy as anywhere else. I've seen patients be misdiagnosed quite a number of times only to go somewhere else and have it discovered. Residents can be over worked, fellows and attendings cab be swamped with cases. I'm not saying this is true 100% of the time, just saying every hospital and every practitioner is capable of making mistakes.
110	If you aim it stores three bullets allowing you to burst fire.	What exactly differentiates an "Elite" Wingman from a standard Wingman? Thanks for your help! I LOVE YOUR GAME.
111	Choice, conservation and management are even more accessible, and very effective.	This. Nuclear is much more expensive than having people put solar panels on their personal property and connecting to a grid already set up to take them.
112	It was in reference to the show The League	Ocho hasn't played a football game since 2014. And that was for the CFL's Montreal Alouettes. He hasn't played in the NFL since 2011.
113	Found the Sony bot.	Seriously? It's one of the best films I saw this year.
114	Except Luis for athletico bombs forward and crosses?	Not really, yes full backs in 9 out of 10 teams do overlap, but theres that one team that has them stay back and play as actual defenders (Atleti, West Brom, etc) and it should be an option for people to use and even though there is an option in "stay back while attacking" it doesn't work, if you want it as you are saying and having your full backs push, just leave them on default, but this is something that should be addressed imo, as it completely shuts out an entire style of play
115	Never understood the purpose of banning people from an anonymous site they can register an unverifiable account to within 30 seconds of their ban.	Well, I guess we can't "brigade" it and earn ourselves some two day bans. Thanks, Reddit!
116	But I haven't listened to any wisps in that game or does it not matter at all	Monty will make random remarks when you go down. The shadow man will talk directly to your character (I believe) upon your first down after the wisps swap to red. So far from experience; He questions Tank directly, asking if he even remembers his own name. He questions Nikolai directly, asking if he is actually proud of his russian blood. I think he asks Richtofen about a promise. And I don't remember Takeo's. I think it had to do with his pursuit of honor.

121	Lets just hope he doesn't use this to inspire his supporters to commit violence against anyone.	He's got a rabble that will listen to him regardless of evidence or truth, because he's speaking directly to their emotions. That's a great group of people to appeal to when starting a TV network, and if he's got a hook (*"The election was rigged, and WE should have won!"* would work nicely) that he can come back to thematically on that network, he can make a lot of money for a long time by stoking the resentment his supporters have for e.g. muslims, Democrats, black people, etc... The talk of a rigged election is either a face-saving measure being taken by someone very aware of the brand perception around his name (and therefore his wallet), someone priming the collective id of his followers to subscribe to a countercultural movement (like the TV network), or both. I don't know that I'd call Donald Trump a smart guy, but he's very calculating, at the least - I'm guessing he's got a few contingency plans to make sure that he gets his no matter *what* happens to the country in the process.

125	We do not have a lock on the bye yet hommie	Oakland's ROS situation I think it's incredible that coming into this week oak was 10-2 and they were still in the worst spot of any advice playoff team. They had to play @ chiefs for the division which they lost. Now they will likely play @denver in week 17 to decide who plays @AFC north (I think the Steelers but who knows) who is way better than whoever wins the AFC south and then @NE week 2 of the playoffs. One of the crazier scheduling situations I can remember down the stretch.
126	Yeah because the timing was off	No, thats not even in the same year..

130	don't care about security updates?	I have 16GB of ram but I was part of a Windows 10 rollout that was corrupt and now I'm stuck on a version from October 2015. (I can easily update with an install disc but that takes time and effort) When I run BF1 multiple programs start leaking. Desktop Windows Manager and System begin to leak as well. After 2 games my RAM is almost full.

132	It has been ages since they had a visitor.	I'm still shocked aol is alive, I still have 500 free hours of internet in my house somewhere
133	how long were yall together?	Maybe I chose the wrong term. I meant that they would just be trying to make themselves feel better about the situation they've left you in. They don't want to be with you but they may feel bad they've broken your heart. Or maybe they just want some attention or validation. My ex (who fell out of love with me) knows that I need no contact to get over her and I respect that she hasn't contacted me.
134	Yeah, it's spelled "tris"!	One of those e's just doesnt belong here..
135	The real question is how can it predate the bible if the bible doesn't mention it...checkmate	Aside from going to space, doesn't... Doesn't all that predate NASA by hundreds/thousands of years?
136	now I know what to say every time I miss the tyr blink combo.	While I was binging on Serqet, I noticed something that really irritated me. As you may know, one of Serqet's greatest initiations requires the relic "Blink". You find a target, blink to them and either 2 - 1 - 4 - auto or 4 - 2 - 1 - auto. During these combos I noticed I was missing opportunities quite a lot due to a delay after I blinked. I was wondering what was happening and it appears that Blink drops you at your teleport location, instead of teleporting you directly on the ground. It leaves you in a falling state momentarily after you blink into your location. Sort of like when you walk out of the fountain in assault. It also appears to carry your momentum even if you stopped pushing forward during the blink. I was wondering if its supposed to be like this or if its a bug that no one ever really complained about. Either way, it really bothers me sometimes and I would love if it was changed.
137	Flawless logic	You see girls have a tendency to like games like Warcraft and Zelda and girls are only casual gamers so if a girl likes it, it must be casual.
138	If you're Indian, you just have to wait for the Europeans to come so that you can catch a few plagues or something for the tech boost	Which way to the Americas as an Indian nation? I want a chance at spawning Colonialism as Nagaur, which I know requires having discovered the Americas. In previous attempts I was going west, but it occurs to me that I could go east instead, which has the added benefit of colonizing regions that actually can feed into my home trade node. I feel like west is probably still shorter, but it would be nice if I were wrong. Anyone know?
139	Because normal people respond to a variety of 911 calls with limited information.	You act like normal people just go out and accidentally shoot a senior citizen standing in a driveway to death.
140	I don't disagree but I submit as evidence everything they've done in the South China sea to expand their claims over the region.	Still have to have a reason for violating the rules of international waters that you agreed to follow or major shipping that goes through that area will start to become more stressed and possibly break down.
141	Yeah making those 2 saves on the empty net was atrocious defense!	He's great. I hope that sometime in the next 8 years he learns how to play defense.
142	In Minnesota our Democratic Party (The democratic farmer and laborer party) is a relic of the progressive movement.	The Quakers wanted to free to slaves in the early days of the country too.
143	It's a conspiracy by the solar power lobbyists!	They are giving us daylight, we would stay with sunnier evenings.
144	But it's juuuuust a gaaaaaame.	Cheating and creating cheats for online games is now officially a crime in south korea
145	Been thinking this would be perfect for him	Cazorla would absolutely decimate this city squad today.
146	No but somehow racists opinions are worth considering before making policy change now	Do those people even vote D?
147	Could have been San Francisco...	Now make them Asian, (not ancestrially, fresh off the plane), hang a giant touristy camera on each one, and send them barrelling around the city with busy workday crowds filled with bitter underpaid professionals, lost out of town families, angry protestors, and clueless 20somethings too busy "changing the world" to pay attention, in groups of 10 or more, with a tour guide who can't speak loudly or slowly enough. Welcome to DC.
148	What figure is this?	Best blind purchase I've ever made on an action figure.
149	But I need an assault rifle to protect my family from home invasions!	I always laugh at Americans defending that. Every single statistic pretty much proves gun control works. There is no reason a civiialn needs a semi auto.
150	yo ok that kids eyes are legit demon eyes, did anyone else notice this?	I agree with Dylan
151	This isn't about me.	Don't you have anything better to do then to reinforce this pathetic and petty image of yourself?
152	God was trying to smite you for your pagan ways	I'm an atheist, but Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, or whatever other celebration that is going on. Happy Holidays to everyone. I got up this morning and saw lightening.......interesting!
153	These rocks are not for shale!	How I feel when I find a metamorphic rock in my yard...
154	Speaking of [[Friendly Bartender]], I love that card so much that I kept all 17 copies I got, and I'll never dust them!	But why do that when you can transform a River Croc into a *Friendly Bartender* and stuff it into an Expansion ~~to make packs worse so you buy more~~!
155	I mean I would rather have termites or other pests almost anywhere else than my house	That isn't solved by where you stack your wood, if you stack wood anywhere you deal with dwellers.
156	The Last of Us?	Ya I cant recall one WRPG that has prepubescant girls with thigh skirts and panty shots while the girl is all googley eyed for your every move.
157	Great, less people to worry about abusing the system, right?	Overdose deaths so far in 2016 are higher than in all of 2015
158	Not Hackney Road looking North?	Does anyone know where this pic was taken?
159	Thank god there was one brave soul willing to stand up to this blatant animal cruelty.	If they're trying to expose them to get used to each other this is a weird fucking way to do it. My roommate got a puppy a couple weeks after I got my [not quite fully grown] cat and assimilating them to each other so they would play nice was a pain in the ass, but we didn't lock them in a crate together.
160	Yeah, why would they want to test their game on thousands of PC setups for way less money than what they would have to pay quality testing companies who test with 20 PCs.	officially confirming the long known fact that betas aren't actually betas
161	Wasn't trying to be mean, just sounds better when you happen to talk about it again c:	Oh yes you're right, should have researched a bit before posting... but thanks for your correction
162	Come on Clay, just because they rape young boys and wipe their ass with their bare hand doesn't mean they are not a civilized as us...	I think that's called cultural relativism. It's one thing to respect other people's traditions even though they're different, but there needs to be a moral boundary to our tolerance. Child rape is clearly far on the wrong side of that boundary.
163	Same...	I found it very intersting to read, maybe one day I'll understand it.
164	It's okay, just keep it wavy.	Oh I thought he only wanted black models, my bad
165	what about showing the wireframe of enemies that are in the same hex as you are whenever you plant a recon dart in the spawn room	No, they are going to increse its pulse and show in which direction the enemy its facing.
166	Use one AirPod at a time.	Buy two pairs
167	Sounds like you have a bad battery	I really liked my S7 Edge when I first bought it, but I'm ready to throw this damn thing out a window. It's constantly lagging (there are times where I type a whole message, and I'm finished typing before it even starts processing the message), and battery life has been awful, lately. I kind of expected a 3600 mAh battery to last me the day (and not drop to less than 50% in a morning).
168	commas are your friend	Herstory of the world alternatives
169	Indian roller too	You could check out the moontower. I think that place is pretty cool.
170	Ja!	Fire up the Data
171	North Korea	What is very dangerous and can attack at anytime?
172	Your trolling right ahahah sure mate	your 4 limited items + tit white mariachi hat &amp; lime wizard hat
173	more sombras	Small Update?
174	Of course, as expected	wow this one got downvoted really hard...
175	Yes because white people are so oppressed	Must be my white male privilege that causes this.
176	Inb4 it's some house of cards conspiracy shit	CNN is making this about the election right now...
177	God im old, i was under the impression that this was something everyone knew	TIL There was an Official Cinematic for Dominion
178	But but.... They are editing the DOW to fit Hilary's narrative!	This sounds like every ardent Fox News viewer who parrots the same bullshit line about how liberals get their news from the "Clinton News Network" or "MSDNC", two networks not even liberals give a shit about these days.
179	I thought you meant that you had tattooed one massive papercut onto your skin and I was very confused.	All over the place. It's like a papercut. Not a big deal.
180	meirl	Better person
181	Fortunately for him, he is running against Hillary who, if you could build the worlds worst candidate, it would be her.	He's really trying to get my vote. Too bad he's an uncouth, proudly professed unrepentant dickwad.
182	How else could you read that?	all of which is interesting, as supposedly some white supremacists groups also use LOTR as indoctrination: the Orcs are the *evil blacks* coming to rape and pillage, and it's up to the *good white* people to stop them.
183	Gee I wonder why?	Former Bucs TE Austin Seferian-Jenkins was not claimed on Waivers
184	Danny Woodhead, Julian Edelman, Toby Gerhardt, Wes Welker, etc.	Who does Christian McCaffrey remind you of? I'm a big McCaffrey fan and love watching him run. That being said, I couldn't think of a great comparison of his running style. He's got great burst and shake and is awesome as a receiver out of the backfield. The closest comparison I could think of was Marshall Faulk, but that doesn't seem perfect. Who am I forgetting?
185	Because they have a goldfish's memory, so even if they had one, nobody would remember where it is.	why the dont the novakids get a role in being an artifact? currently all the races except for the novakids have artifacts (main storyline). I mean I understand that they where a player idea, but whyyyyyyyy, why would you leave those guys out?
186	It doesn't matter the quality anyway we can always 'enhance that'	I'd love to be at a cctv convention. To hear the talk about why 315p will remain the gold standard for the next 25 years.
187	Shocking	TIL materials needed to produce a pair of $199 Beats Solo HD headphones totalled a whopping $16.89, which is approximately 8.5% of retail price.
188	did they kick the griefer	Bomb Spawns in CT Spawn (Jasonrrr stream)
189	Yeah, I'm not going to sit through 4 30-second commercials just to see a 2-minute clip on 4oD.	That's exactly the reason why it's blocked in UK. You can't really make money on it elsewhere, so you might just as well let them see it, but in UK you can get people to rather watch it on 4oD.
190	Here, I ran down to the shops and bought this just for your sake:	If you think this is a good plan, you're definitely "that weird guy".
191	I think we're onto something!	Like...on a coin?
192	wer da	What's this?! Don't you know this is r/ClashOfClans where we never praise supercell and always criticize their updates for not including every single requested feature?
193	Yeezus	Who would you call the most influential music artist of the 21st century?
194	Well yeah, he killed a "terra-ist"	At this rate, I don't think Trump supporters would even believe/care.. the man said it himself that he could shoot somebody in broad daylight and he would still be supported.
195	Well that's certainly a realistic endeavor.	Former Sanders Supporter Aims To Get More African-Americans To Vote Republican
196	GET THIS TO THE TOP BOYS	I know a girl who thought she was pregnant with Obama's baby but she's got issues. One, that she wasn't even pregnant at the time or ever.
197	Great ground game	Trump campaign left out of Alaska voter guide
198	Make Benelux Great Again!	Kingdom of the Netherlands 1816
199	I had edited my original post, as I meant Cowher - former steelers coach.	How can you listen to cowherd at all? He's one of the worst blowhards. One of my co-workers used to listen to him and every week cowherd would tell us that athletes aren't like us. They go to parties to meet people and have sex. He'd tell us that like we're all a bunch of idiot shut ins and he'd say it every week. I remember him also playing recorded interviews line by line while criticizing every line for the most ridiculous, imagined shit. He's insufferable.
200	That means they'll keep it up to date with the latest tech, right?	Soon you will be paying a subscription service to still use your car.
201	You forgot the	Just got this beauty at Walmart
202	MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN!	It must be nice having such a simplistic view of politics.
203	yeah but they were the greatest 18 mins of all time	He only played 18 minutes. You're really overrating the impact he had on this game
204	*Peoples'*	There exists a special circle of hell for anyone who corrects other people's grammar, online or aloud. I already know that someone will correct the grammar in this somehow.
205	That's how much **courage** costs these days	The price of the dongles is more upsetting than needing dongles. $50 for USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 $20 for USB-C to USB $25 for USB-C to Lightning $70 for USB-C to HDMI $70 for USB-C to VGA I couldn't imagine spending $4,300 on a maxed out MacBook Pro and then being told I need to spend an extra $50 to connect my Thunderbolt external hard drive to it.
206	Don't be an asshole	Don't be a creep
207	Hummm, I still wonder about Brendan claiming SA told him early morning of 10/31/05, that TH were visiting that day!	Selling the Blazer On page 46 in the November 6th interview, Brendan makes an interesting statement. LE asks him when did he see SA next. Brendan states he and Blaine saw him before they went to school. Steve drove up by where they were and told them the Blazer would be gone in the next few days because he sold it. I found that curious...after all that supposedly happened the night before he wants to let them know he sold the blazer. Which makes me think, he got a call from the buyer the night of the 31st, or maybe that morning. It's just a slice of SA's demeanor I think, on Tuesday morning.
208	I would bet on Sage too but subbing Gall seems like a (needlessly) longer bet.	Yeah, I've got sage for this one. Everyone is too invested in gall after he beat up a middle aged man with no fight expirence
209	True dat lol, he's at home right now flipping a shit about the refs too	Not really, SVG always looks pissed off lol. He could explode right now away from the court.
210	Smith never clicked for me	Am I the only one who liked Smith better than Tennant? (and so far I like Capaldi better than both)
211	Nice mousepad you have there on the left!	Ascension is Glorious! I have joined the Master Race at long last!
212	it looks like Chinese	What makes you so sure?
213	If you have a link for this product (the card), hook it up with a link!	I want i think its called a executive card or something... You put prefilled lines in this credit card thing and it hold like 6... Or a royal box that has a built in straw and it has divets that you can pull out thathas lines in it too
214	Alex Jones fully is the guy who yells at chipotle employees to speak English, right?	Alex Jone Melts down over assange
215	Fuck a Hulu.	This is like my favorite show right now. I'm watching it on Hulu
216	Oh hello Nep, didn't know you changed your username	Try Bale at CDM
217	I agree but the mentality tends to be different for some reason.	Many cops are veterans.
218	"You're still a loser"	"Fuck you mom I'm taking a picture while fliping you off!" "Why that's lovely Samantha."
219	Yeah, it's a party every week baby!	Seager hits another 1st inning homerun
220	Aubrey Marcus is still a better guest than Brandon"work ethic " Schaub	Every time Chris "Aubrey" Marcus is on the podcast
221	You should start your post with system name like [PC] or [PS4]	Looking for GTA 5 players to do missions with :)

223	Anytime I'm in common areas and bored I walk around and give everyone "Blessing of King's"	Wow confessional thread
224	Where is the MSM?	Trump Supporters have raised over $88,000 to Repair the Hopewell Baptist Church
225	No - it's been processed, so it's not *actually* wood anymore.	If I stack a giant pile of paper, will it be considered a dead tree?
226	ahh, the old dick joke	I guess that's what people call humor these days..
227	Every item included in the halloween event is buyable!	Is it just skins or can you buy other Halloween items with gold?
228	Q letting those expletives fly!	S5 E26 Season Finale "Nitro Circus Spectacular" Episode Discussion Thread Thought I'd throw up the thread early as there were complaints there wasn't a thread last week made by mods. The discussion will be temporarily stickied to the front page for a day or two.
229	We have no Giannis :( the Greek Freak is lord of the stank face.	Yeah you too! ...Wait a minute.
230	"I think it's a mirrow"	Pat-a-cat
231	Practice your passing instead of blaming the game maybe?	WL bs so im currently 16W 6L at the moment. and its been a hell of a struggle getting through all the bullshit. iI have an 87 rated team,, full of IF's can someone explain to me why 9/10 passes they do either go to the opponent, deflect off my players to the oppponent etc? even the through balls are WAAAAY off my player will be making a run to the left, and they will through ball it the opposite way this happens twice as much in WL as it does seasons, and its obviously non existant offline.... wtf is going on with this crap it is really annoying seeing my players lose possesion all the fucking time and i have to work even harder than i normally do to get the win and overcome the bs TLDR: why are so many passes fucked up?
232	They looked at which was more hoarded and went with the other.	Roark vs Estrada.... Thank you SDS for upgrading the wrong pitcher. Seems like they purposely do this type of stuff. Yes I'm a salty Roark owner. Here's proof why I should be. RIP 234 Roarks
233	I admire your love and dedication.	Keep buying DWK on iTunes guys! Let's get top 5 next week!
234	Ok I think I just SHAT my pants.	Freighter passes over scuba diver
235	Does this imply I'm a five now?	Less photogenic? A beard trim and your hair out of your eyes and bam, you're a 7 (pun intended).
236	Thank you for voting!	I voted for Clinton the first two times starting when i was 19 and I haven't missed an election yet!
237	You should probably add a	no one thinks its funny. we're just taking it back, you porchmonkey.
238	For me, it's when I realized AC3 had no assassination and you were healing so fast you were basically Wolverine and could defeat the entire British army bare handed if you wanted to.	I remember when Ubisoft was as respected and beloved as Blizzard. What the hell happened?
239	Get yourself a chainmail glove and hope for the best	How are people landing the Mavic in rough terrain or tight spots? I imagine it's harder to catch out of the air than the Phantoms? Most of the situations that I would be using the drone in would be considered off the beaten path. Most likely it would be on mountains skiing, or on a boat Kitesurfing.
240	The "Worlds" of CoD has happened three times and I think the Koreans have combined for a total of one map.	ehh.. the guy who used to have highest KD in the world (BO1) was Korean. I don't think you've escaped the Koreans
241	How much does it cost, though?	Nintendo Reveals Nintendo Switch, Formerly Nintendo NX
242	It's rigged because brown people shouldn't be able to vote.	What the fuck? Trump and surrogates are complaining that polls were staying open to allow people to vote????????????? WHAT THE FUCK???????????????????????? HOW IS ALLOWING PEOPLE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE PROOF OF A 'RIGGED ELECTION' ??????

247	I can't believe people have expectations for a movie based on the three previous movies in the series!	Ball's* Also, JL hasn't even been finished and sad lowlifes like you are already waiting to bury it before release. That's what I've come to expect from most of your replies on Reddit, just laughable bitter behaviour.
248	What are you talking about, this is the standard movie commercial break method	When you're desperate for ad revenue
249	I think the given is that this is chapter 849, so oda will have something bug for 850, so there'll be a break before, and a break after for new year	That's a given. It's been 4 weeks, and Oda hasn't put up 5 chapters in a row in recent years.
250	My favorite show and my favorite tv parents!	Can we take a moment to discuss Kitty Foreman being the best television mother ever?
251	It would happen at compile time regardless.	Division is more expensive than multiplication, right? Wouldn't that make the initial one the better choice?
252	Eye can see you up there...	My New Defense Tower Is Ready
253	I thought it was 21 minutes, making the hoarding much less of an issue.	Java fidy sold out in 17 minutes for cans and a few hours for crowlers. Oskar blues actually sent out an apology saying they fucked up without setting limits so that one is harder to get. BA Ten Fidy had a lot more cans and should hit shelves so won't be as difficult to find.
254	That's a good way to get people to stop	Thanks for the downvotes you cucks
255	Any 1070 is a good buy how is this even a question	Is this a good 1070 to buy?
256	Does it stop being animal cruelty if you add red wine and *fines herbes* to the animal?	Why is it always the french when it comes to animal cruelty?
257	Works for me.	Just tell them "A professional flag nerd". That should about cover it.
258	NEIN!^^actually ^^you're ^^100% ^^correct	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the German political system has went through a few changes since 1933
259	agreed :/	I know, which makes me sad because that skin concept was one of the coolest ones that was posted.
260	Does anyone know what a dog jonesing for narcotic looks like?	He's back from the vet tripping balls
261	Found the racist sexist Trump supporter who would probably vote for Pepe	I'm just so incredibly relieved that people fought back and that their propaganda apparently didn't work on everyone (although you have to admit, it probably did work on quite a few). What would become of our country and democracy if we rewarded that sort of behavior?
262	Surprisingly Hillary has been silent on this and hasn't called for a recount.	To pay for the recount. You have to pay for the cost of counting the votes if you demand a revote. Or something.
263	hole situation*	I'm fine with this whole situation
264	*I started having a panic attack right there in the mall, and of course my cis-white-hetero family has no sympathy or understanding of my conditions...*	"...and then the entire food court slow clapped"
265	Obviously what I meant.	Yeah he deserved to die. That long living fuck.
266	Saying that this was a close primary that would have changed if the DNC hadn't favored Clinton is just patently false though, it wasn't close and them wanting Clinton to win didn't overall change the outcome of the election	I'm not interested in speaking in absolutes. I'd hope your distain of others making absolute assumptions would align with your views.
267	Can't even argue with that.	Classic Pillar: close your eyes, flail and hope Satan honors the contract you made with him.
268	The drop sounds very similar to the one in Autoerotique's collab with Major Lazer - The Sound	Thanks mate
269	The cars are incredibly close now ... except for, you know, Honda FTFY.	The cars are incredibly close now ... except for, you know, Mercedes.
270	I feel like Part 4 had so much more energy and life in it compared to a few of the other parts.	to be honest, they could make a hole slice of life of DiU with out stands and with out fights and it would still work because all of the characters have so much personality to them
271	Wow bet that really showed the Nazi's	TIL that students living in Nazi-occupied Norway wore paperclips on their lapels as a non-violent symbol of resistance and unity.
272	Yo les pianos	Old video of smithzz playing the piano beautifully
273	Don't forget their holy capitol in Oregon... the Malhauer bird refuge.	Your a bit crazy here, and the straw man of using Islamic state is ridiculous. The tea party wants to remove the right to marry, force schools to teach Christian bunk like creationism, put gays back in the closet, force women to give birth... So in relation to an ideal society of freedom of person the tea party IS as bad as an Islamic caliphate. If we give them (christians) an inch it's only a matter of time before they are throwing gays off buildings... or dragging them behind trucks.
274	I can't begin to imagine the energy in the stadium after that.	Not a bad first game to attend as a New Yorker :)
275	Just like Adam.	OMG Justin - wants to use his money to help the kids in NOLA. :'-( I bet he'll do it too.
276	Congratulations OP on finding the smallest, most useless gif of this video yet.	Boxing match

278	Get good and don't be in memejoe joseph's class	How to succeed in Chemistry 1A and 1AL? I'm a sophomore taking Chemistry 1A with Kunkel and I'm having a rough time. I attend all classes and go to CLAS with Eric but I'm still failing. 50% on the first midterm and in lab I've gotten a D on every single quiz. I do get A's and B's on ALEKS and lab reports, though. I think the problem I have is that ALEKS, book problems, and CLAS questions are easier and dissimilar to exam questions so they're hard to study from... All of my friends and roommates who have already taken the general chemistry series keep telling me how it's the easiest chemistry class so I shouldn't be struggling and it just keeps making me feel even more stupid. My goal is a B in both classes... Does that seem feasible with the curve applied at the end of the quarter? I'm honestly terrified that I'll have to retake and screw up my academic plan for the next couple of years. I was just wondering if anyone had any tips. At this point, I'll try anything. Thanks.

281	"Beware the fury of a patient man" - John Dryden	What is your favourite quote?
282	Sexism/racism isn't lessened because it's done to "someone of a privileged group"	Using the word bitch supports sexism. Dickhead would support misandry as well, except it's way less obvious in society generally since most men are in a favored position.
283	Gotta love the crazy Yakuza's.	So much money, so little class
284	Sorry	pls no
285	What's the reverb/hold?	Timmy and zCat Reverb/Hold!
286	But Hillary's just as bad and would have done the same things!	He is also a person who opposes the Civil Rights Act. I hope all of those who voted (or abstained) because of their "conscience" feel good about themselves.
287	there lies the problem, un will always be handicapped.	And reforms will be vetoed by these guys too.

292	I don't think that TKOL is their magnum opus in the sense that RIL is for Talking Heads, but I do see and agree with that comparison: they've both got 5 spunky, polyrhythmic songs and then 3 slow, emotional songs.	It's cool, but i would rate TKOL as Radiohead's "Remain In Light".

295	Tbh, the salami sword thing was way more racist than Pierce's comment.	Right before this exchange, Britta says "Shirley! That's the most racist thing I've ever heard!" and Jeff replies "Pierce will beat that in 1 minute," starting a timer on his watch. Then this exchange takes place, and right after Pierce says "she's not?!" Jeff stops the timer on his watch and remarks "29 seconds."

301	Yeah, I'm actually not too worried about the recounts, but something is fishy, and I don't think we should take it too lightly.	To show that it really was rigged? It also makes him the least likely suspect. The man thinks ahead. I believe that he won fairly, so I am not worried about a recount. Could they do something during a recount to swing it her way? I highly doubt it. None of us know why Jill is doing it or who is paying for it. We are getting excited about nothing.

308	God sent the call to show you the call did not come from God.	I once was called to the Phoenix, Arizona mission. I have Ectodermal Dysplasia! Ectodermal Dysplasia is a genetic condition and there can be many symptoms, but one of my biggest is that I don't really sweat. Like I sweat probably about 1/5 of a normal person, which causes me to overheat very easily and I have to be careful when I'm in hot places. I put ALL of this information on my mission papers, told them that I definitely could not go anywhere hot UNLESS I had a car with A/C. Otherwise I can guarantee you I would have passed out, gotten physically sick, had massive headaches, etc. from exerting myself in the heat on a bike. Even just walking continually in heat would cause massive problems for me. So I get my mission call and guess where they called me to - Phoenix, AZ! I was so confused, how could they be inspired to call me somewhere I CLEARLY could not serve (because my SP called the MP over there and there were no missionary cars at the time). I thought it was a test of my faith on whether I'd obey priesthood leaders and go even though it didn't make sense. I told my SP, after much agonizing, that I just couldn't do it, I physically wouldn't be able to do the work I needed to. They assigned me to a new place and I went where they called me the second time. I used to think all of that was inspired, that the First Presidency was supposed to call me AZ first, that it taught me some great lesson I needed to know about following my own feelings/revelation and not just going along with my priesthood leaders. I guess it did teach me that though, and eventually lead to me going home halfway through my mission so I should be grateful for that :) Can you imagine if I'd tried to serve there though? That could have been extremely dangerous for my health! Stupid church.

326	Yeah, that makes about as much sense as FNaFs timeline...	Backwards FNAF storyline(Now with Sister Location) In 1983, after Trapspring(a robot human bunny zombie) had a nice family reunion with his undead son, a bunch of people took animal masks from their homes and placed it in a pile of ruble. This created a gigantic fire that created a horror attraction, a security guard, and phantoms of a bear, a chicken, a slenderman ripoff, a spider fox, a fox that was missing an arm, a fat boy, etc. Trapspring was vanquished when he was put behind a wall in a room. 30 years later, he absorbed blood from some ghosts and pooped out a purple man. The man proceeded to assemble Freddy, Bonnie, Foxy, and Chica. Soon a restaurant was built around their popularity. Purple man then decided to eat some robotic clown monster from the sewer, only to go to his new location(Circus Baby's pizza world) to use the succer to rip out Ennard, who was them dismantled into Funtime Freddy and Foxy, Ballora, and Baby. He later gave the rights to a business man after going to jail for not murdering any children. Phone guy was created when Freddy ripped a person out of another Freddy's mouth. Due to the lack of rat infestation, the restaurant closed down. All the animatronics where torn apart. Soon the Toy animatronics where created. Because of the kind heart of the children, Mangle was put back together. Purple guy then chased children out of the Toy animatronics by putting on a yellow bear suit and sucking them into the backroom. The Puppet and Freddy moonwalked backwards until the police left. After Fritz set all the animatronics back to normal, PG took the dayshilft before the restaurant was closed down. Golden Freddy was turned into a kid by the Puppet, where 4 bullies yanked the kid out of Fredbear's stomach and gave him plushies. The kid then saw Spring Bonnie and Fredbear fix people and exerted them from their bodies and was un-traumatized. Soon some gas leaks occurred, causing Baby to give birth to William's half-daughter, take her ice cream, then ran away. The Puppet them yanked the kids out of Freddy, Bonnie, Foxy, and Chica before giving them to Spring Bonnie that later exerted Purple Guy after he tore knifes out of the kids bodies. The restaurant was later handed over to Frebear's Family dinner because they had less money. Fredbear ran around and stole cake from happy children while the Puppet was demoted to sock monkey. Purple guy brought a kid back to life before making him cry, got in his car, and drove backwards into the sunset. Fredbear later made a TV series that wasn't very successful. He raised exactly 2 dollars.

328	Would be a nice gesture for sure, but yeah does depend on the person.	PSA: if you are giving/receiving an Xbox one console for christmas, considering booting it up before wrapping it to download/install any mandatory updates or digital games! This process could take significantly longer on Christmas Day due to the sudden influx of new console owners pounding the network. Also, if it's anything like last year, there could be more DDOS attacks that render the online services completely useless for days which could prevent the gift from even being able to play their games if they're digitally bundled. Happy holidays to all!

368	Ahem, in 'Murcia we call 'em "Freedom Units".	Words change. Language changes. Hell, even people who live in the same time and place can have different perceptions on language and meaning. Communication is a two way street, you have a transmitter and a receiver. You may think it's silly but what's really important is the people you're trying to communicate with. To facilitate the best communication, you should try to tailor your language so it fits best with who you're talking to. If you're from the US and talking to a 12 year old from France (who has most likely only dealt with the metric system in their life) would you just continue to talk about miles and degrees F? Or would you try to tailor your words to meet their needs and convert to metric for them? The second would help you communicate with them much easier, the first makes you sound like a bit of a jerk. It's the same thing with referring to other people with the right names. It may seem silly to you, but if you don't do it you just sound like a jerk.

People are tremendously tilted and lot's of boosteds and smurfs widen the variety of different skill-levels in a game. Thus, it feels like your impact on winning games is small and there are way more istant wins (e.g. the enemy team has a boosted) and instant losses (e.g. you are outclassed on every lane because the enemy got duo smurfs).

Once the proof is out I'll show myself here, people should stay skeptical, I just needed information, didn't need people to believe in me.

442	You don't know how annoying this is when you're in a dogfight chasing the enemy and he is acting up like that, just going back and forth.. Really good countermeasure tho	Anyone else hate how the rubberbanding works? My router is plugged in halfway across the house and I live with 3 other people, so lagging and rubberbanding is pretty common for me. However, unlike many other games where you just teleport back, this game actively slows you down, and slowly slides you back to your previous position. I have to stop and stand still as the game slide me through a wall or whatever. Even worst is when I get killed because I can't hop a fence.

449	Killary	Questioning Hillary Clinton's Health is Sexist
450	Do you have to secure secrets from yourself or those who aim to assist you?	So, the RNC was capable of securing their secrets while the DNC was not and that's called "actively hiding the "Truth""?
451	How dare you assume his level of attractiveness	I'm sorry. I should use description-neutral adjectives.
452	Christmas can bring out the good and the worst in people.	Christmas is an excuse for people to only be nice once a year. Santa Claus was created to counteract this.

Of course I'm probably nowhere near right and am being really inconsiderate for even writing that, but I just kinda had to.	You have to admire the mental craftsmanship of a pov such as his; where the relationship he constructed on the foundation of intimacy should and cannot not be impacted by his need to be intimate with others.

469	People voted for Trump specifically in reaction to people like you.	Your post history is filled with Trump supporting bullshit. I'm surprised you aren't grabbing her pussy in this picture. Let me guess, she doesn't know anything about politics so she doesn't understand how problematic your ideas are that you express in your post history? Good thing my girlfriend is a liberal atheist and doesn't have to get fucked staring at your teddy bear with a Trump shirt on sitting next to your giant American flag. I assume your Bible was on the nightstand? Also, what the fuck is going in with your feet? And hair? Also also, I know my post history is retarded, it's on purpose. Yours isn't...

477	Because world history isn't good enough source material	I don't believe for a second this could be good. Purely, because AC games themselves are just bad. They don't have any decent source material to draw from.

488	So far we're at three timelines and counting, with a few events taking place outside of this (like mib killing Maeve and her daughter)	That line definitely made me buy the William = MiB theory a lot more. The main problem I can't reconcile is Dolores having a flashback of the buried town being inhabited, when she and William are there in its buried state.
489	Now she's a Jill Stein esque radical leftist	Don't we love left wing hypocrisy, folks? They were shouting for Tulsi to run in 2020 a few months ago and now today she's "a homophobic racist nationalist" because she met with Trump

514	Must be one of them 4Chan hackers	Dude...
515	The packaging fairies?	Except that's not how money works. Best case scenario there is more money in the market to compete for goods and services (which raises the price of things effectively giving you a pay cut) Worst case is it drives up labour costs which make businesses unprofitable and result in layoffs. Remember that many minwage jobs are supplied by min wage workers. Who do you think packages all them fries or buns or burgers that McDonalds sells?

529	EUW	what server?
530	Monte has charisma and certain kind of charm to him, I wouldn't say LS has either of those qualities.	The alternative is Monte. Let's think about that for a moment.
531	You should see the airfield around server restarts, it's usually 3 different groups fighting it out.	Meanwhile I walk through the airfield on a full server and dont find any action. I can't wait for higher pop servers.
532	About 3.50$	How much would you pay for this team?
533	Can't fault Ronaldo to be eager to start his coaching career when it looked like his playing career was over.	Honestly, that shit was disrespectful to the coach. But I digress...
534	Can you elaborate how this makes them kool-aid drinkers cause I don't remember any bullshit from arenanet.	Arena net (guild wars 2 company) chugs it pretty hard. Both canonical lesbian's and trans characters

536	I'd rather beat them properly, but thanks	You can cheese the first one with arrows through the fog gate if you don't mind that sort of thing. Fire Mirden Hammer works well too
537	Christmas won some pivotal battles this year, but we will win the war.	...says the "War on Christmas" crowd.
538	I think (hope) you forgot this:	The metric system is undeniably easier to use than Imperial, but it is hampered by its connection to our decimal system. While Imperial is a hopeless jumble of different units and conversions, you'll notice that many of these units, in a vacuum, are actually quite nice. The inch is one such example. Twelve is a much nicer number than ten. Ten already reaches for the decimal mark with such a common fraction as one fourth and is completely hopeless when it comes to thirds. Consider seconds/minutes/hours which are counted in 60 and 12 (or 24 or whatever). These are also really nice numbers. You can use minutes to measure half-an-hour, quarter til, ten past, etc. and you'll still have a whole number because 60 has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 as divisors. This could be possibly be a partial reason why the French attempt to establish decimal time never took off.
539	Yeah, totally worth the risk of killing people.	Take it from the son of a trucker, it doesn't work that way. You drive when they tell you to drive or you lose your job and can't pay the bills. Some companies are good about their schedule and others aren't. There ARE laws that govern how long a person can drive for, typically 12 or 14 hours is the maximum, with a 10 hours downtime required if you go the full allotment.
540	tl;dr stack that paper up and then make boss moves.	That's real money management. It's all about setting norms. I live in NYC and made about 55K last year before taxes and put away about 4K in savings. It boggles my mind when people say that they make 70K and are living paycheck to paycheck. Like what are you spending money on? Check where your money goes and cut out what you don't need. Then be patient with what you want to buy. Then spend real money on what you really want. Like my $1,500 bike. It's sooo nice and because it is nice it should last me forever. I keep it inside and do regular maintenance myself. I game but haven't spent more then $35 bucks for any games in the last few years. Why? I wait, Titanfall 2 dropped in price so I got it. Fallout 4 just hit my range so I got that two weeks ago for 30 bucks. Anyway that's also how I was raised. Live within your means, save and spend on cool stuff you really want. Don't nickle and dime yourself out of cool stuff. 5 bucks 100 times is 500 bucks...little everyday expenses add up.
541	But are you pissed he smashed it in less than 2 hours tho	I sent him the bike.
542	That lag tho!	Bull Demon is now a playable character!
543	It was a rhetorical question, emphasizing just how few people commenting in this thread seemed to have actually read the article properly before going off on their "anti-white/we're suffering too" circlejerk.	Probably not. The odds of you being the only one are honestly pretty low
544	Yeah Tay lasted a couple hours unsupervised before going way off the deep end as I remember	If only it worked that way. Dumb people get prangernant with other dumb people every day. I'll give 1/3 of these people a pass because of the possibility of trolls and others that don't speak English as a first language, but there's way to many of these that are real. Never show an advanced AI yahoo answers because they will quickly want to purge the human race.

563	Well why wouldn't you, when paradise awaits?	Who is they tiny minority? The religious right is a major political force in US. They are also a major political force in Israel. And they are ready to do anything to fulfill the End Times prophecy.
564	I would be down for all the coastal areas seceding from the inland and rural areas and form our very own Coastal Republic.	I am much more concerned about the effects on California itself. How do we divide (or what do we do with) the UC system, the greatest public university system in the world? No doubt this would change immensely, and likely not for the better. How do we divide the judiciary up? California's judiciary is one of the largest judiciaries in the world (larger than the entire federal judiciary, at the very least, although I have seen different claims about who has the largest judiciary worldwide). There are so many logistical and administrative problems that make whatever national political changes it could have not worth it, even if one would prefer those national political changes. One caveat would be that dividing the Ninth Circuit (a topic on here recently) might actually become feasible at that point. I am also skeptical about dividing into 9 separate states. The Six Californias plan or the idea of bisecting the state (into a Nor-Cal and a So-Cal, sort of) seem to be the most popular, to the extent they are popular at all. Almost every legal scholar I have consulted on the idea thinks it would be terrible for an array of reasons (not necessarily partisan or political reasons).
565	You don't need VOD because Horheristo is going to beat your record next day	If you somehow set a WR on the daily, do you need a VOD to back it up? It's not like I'm going to set a WR anyway, but I was just curious about what qualifies a WR as legit or not (seeing as a single screenshot isn't enough.) I know the daily has a anti-cheat system, which is why I was wondering if you would actually need video evidence of you breaking a record in order to qualify. Thank you preemptively.
566	I prefer a beer and joint while I'm getting my dick sucked in my jacuzzi while my landscaper mows the lawn.	It's quite relaxing, especially with a beer or joint! I put on my headphones and have a solid 3-4 hours to myself!

570	Well, there's a fine example of unbiased reporting.	Right-Wing Gala Gave Freddie Gray Cops Standing Ovation
571	Now tell me what the last x in xxx means because im confused.	Back in the day, this was one of those reoccurring topics on alt.atheism. As with any usenet group, abbreviations were common and two of the most common abbreviations were Xian or Xtian. A lot of people would come into the group and assume that this was some kind of deliberate slight so we'd get posters complaining that it was just because we were afraid to say Christ. Many of them also thought that Xmas was another anti-Christian attempt to remove Jesus from the public square and, thus, thought that Xian was in line with that. It was ultimately incorporated into the FAQ, with a long and detailed history of its usage, but that never stopped people from assuming that it was a slight.

606	Here, you seemed to have dropped this:	I could fix it all. I'd say no to refugees as we didn't destabilize the middle east. I'd say no to tfw or I change the program where you post the job with the government and we find you a suitable Canadian if we can't you can't bring in a tfw. I'd say no to climate change as we are not a country that takes high emissions. Then I would figure out how to get rid of Canada's central bank. I'd probably also tax corporations up the ass. I'd force Rogers Tele us and bell to become comparative by opening up their towers to competition since Canada subsidized their building. If they don't like it I'll create a telecommunications tax and charge them and provide a rebate for everyone who has a service by making telecommunications tax deductible. I would create highways lots of highways like an autobahn style. Imagine a fast as highway up north in Ontario.

643	The greatest reddit comment of all time	There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground." Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the " Houston Center voice." I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. "I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground." And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. "Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground." I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money." For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, "Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one." It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

651	netdecking in a never ending cycle, someone tries to make their own deck, they go to ladder and face tier 1 decks that other people netdecked, they keep losing to those decks and eventually get frustrated and go netdeck.	I think the problem in general is having meta decks that people copy. I would love to see more homebrews and never know what to expect from my opponents, but after a while you expect the same thing over and over. It's part of why I play casual a lot more than ladder, you see a lot more homebrews and unusual decks. Another problem I think, is that Hearthstone doesn't have a lot of cards to begin with, when there's such a limited pool of cards to choose from it's not difficult to get very similar deck ideas especially when certain archetypes are so heavily pushed.
652	Was Opie the other guy that wasn't Anthony or Jim?	Do you think Opie is going to start missing the hate now that he's slowly slipping into total obscurity? At least when there was O&amp;J we had something to feed on. Now that he's on his own I find myself forgetting all about him.

She tells me they slept in the same bed and 'he kissed her' and 'she let him' but stopped before anything more happened.

746	Because people have the right to life, not a good life.	Honestly I think most pro-choice people are avid supporters of sex education and birth control. No One actually wants abortions to happen and I think we all can agree it's better to just avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first place. It makes my brain hurt trying to comprehend why conservatives are pro-life and yet hate welfare and public assistance, cut sex Ed and planned parenthood, etc. like, if you are so pro-life than why do you only care about the fetus?

Looking for new luxury sports car 40-60k As the title states, I'm looking for a new luxury sports car between 40-60k. Overall priority is something quick and fun to drive, but something big enough to comfortably seat four adults or possibly a car seat in the next few years. 4 doors is a must. AWD is prefered. I would prefer new, but used is an option. I'm currently driving a 2014 WRX. Options I'm considering: VW Golf R, Audi S3, Audi S4, BMW 340i. Am I missing out on any other good vehicles? Thanks for your help.

787	But I want to show you my penis and shock you and surprise you.......whatever PC culture of 2016 :)	Not a man - but.. I am a girl who are into girls and guys. I feel like most of the hate for unsolicited nudes stem from lack of interest and/or consent, really. Like a sexually-open straight man would appreciate an unsolicited vag pic, but probably not a dick pic. From their friend. Who they never had an interest in. Which is the common case for many women... they have guy friends who, out of nowhere, just sent nudes. Now if they're interested they probably won't mind. But most of the time, they aren't, and it becomes disgusting. It really is just a matter of reading the signs and/or asking someone to make sure they're okay with sexting or whatever the hell. I mean imagine if you were walking down the road, someone flashed you their dick/vag for 10 seconds, and they just walked on. Yeah, yeah... you might not care. You'll just laugh. But for a lot of people, it's a violating act. Why? Lack of consent. Lack of interest. Again. Point: sending unsolicited nudes might or might not offend someone depending on their interest in you and consent. So the better thing to do is just ask. And follow through with their answer.

He's playing at home vs. Oakland who has allowed the most points to recievers so far, so it looks like there is some potential. I just don't know anything about his team situation. Any Baltimore fans maybe give some more info on his role in the team this season or what side he lines up on? I haven't watched a ravens game this season.

Then, it's the statue insulting local muslims. Then it's the social economy gap (I wonder whether they have data of real social economy gap in the city). What's next? Why do the victims have to concede so much after the riots? Why don't they blame the rioters? No need to prosecute, just straight out shame the rioters.

837	I get that, I guess it comes back to knowing there are states that stay Blue or Red so I just feel that so many votes are useless that it discourages me from voting even though my vote is more important and that isn't right imo.	If every person felt that way states would never swing. Go vote. You're a swinger baby! That said, living in a state that is always blue is awful. You can't have a differing opinion without people smirking like you must be an idiot, and that's only if they aren't calling you a bigot. I can't wait to vote right in their ugly mugs.

Nobody, and I mean NOBODY was talking about SCOTUS appointments when we were electing Obama or when Romney was running. But suddenly now it's a huge fucking deal? Love them or hate them, the SCOTUS operates best politically neutral. The fact we had a Supreme Court Justice weigh in on a presidential election is *unprecedented*, worse still that the Clinton camp was screaming themselves hoarse that Trump would have sway over appointing 4-8 justices (when in fact he'll maybe get to appoint 2). It was stupid to politicize the court and might very well end judicial independence in this country.

859	I'll take the down vote to mean its not possible?	I can give you some idea based on final TVs of last season's divisions, as I said we are not sure yet what the set up will be for this next season. The top tier had a spread of 1300 Wood Elf team to a 2200 Orc team. The 1300 Wood Elf team won the league title. Tier 2 had 1300 Halflings (who finished 4th) to 2300 Chaos Dwarves; 1600TV Norse team won the division. Tier 3 had fresh Norse team (that got pretty beat up and ended at 1050) to a 2000TV Khorne team; 1800 Dark Elves won the division. It looks like this season the lowest tier would be all new teams, but the next season their would be some mismatches based on TV. Not much we can do about that in a perpetual format where promotion and relegation are performance based. It is a fun, friendly and competitive league though.

864	I honestly fear that we will see some sort of a civil war in the United States a decade from now.	Obviously three election cycles aren't conclusive of a long-term pattern, but I'm old enough to see a clear escalation of impassioned voters acting maliciously starting with Obama's election, re-election and this one. It makes me nervous. Regardless of taking a side, if the peaceful exchange of power is questionable, our democracy is at risk. That scares me.

871	White people don't get offended because there are no truly dehumanizing stereotypes for white people.	White people dint get offended, because honestly, who gives a shit.

897	Sorry, I'm trying to put all the pieces together, but it sounds like the biggest question is whether Trump received this information directly from the people who are doctoring emails and trying to influence the election, or whether his campaign people are so stupid that they actually used Sputnik as a source to give him information and he didn't check?	i wasn't suggesting the alert being set to the word 'wikileaks' but i also think it is strange that someone would use a russian news site as a source in a US election when it isn't reported anywhere else. that being said, it is trump's campaign, and from what i gather, they aren't exactly rocket scientists over there. so, maybe they really are that dumb, is what i am suggesting. it's also the simplest explanation as far as i can tell.
898	good, keep in line, and back to the herd ;)	Yeah I've been a daily user of Reddit for 4+ years now and I truly don't care. I like Reddit. You can do whatever you want and I wont stop coming here. So just saying. You probably dont hear this side too often.
899	Nobody wanted it anyway	I'm not betting my ass for anything in this post
900	Annie: Everyone loves you.	Sell me your main/favorite champion And if you one-trick them, that's even better \^^ It doesn't have to be just gameplay, just any reason that makies that champion the most fun champion for you. It could be theme, abilities, lore or anything really. Example: I love Bard because his abilities are simply fun to use. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^INeedANewMainPlsTheyReworkedMine
901	It means that every 11 characters should be an SSR	Dokkan, a place where people read that you have a 9% chance and understand "So, I will summon and MUST get an SSR".
902	Eli is too volatile to lead the Giants to the playoffs.	Eli vs Brady part 3?
903	Good solution!	Just play HL Unless you play on the ANZ server where you get put with all different kinds or ranked monkeys
904	You just don't understand how precious internet points are	Reddit Karma.
905	Hey, that ruse got them US money, now it's UK's turn.	So the husband is basically saying that Iran has kidnapped his wife and held her prisoner on trumped up charges to pressure the British into paying a civil debt and yet he's angry at the British not the Iranians.
906	...and in Tacoma an Apartment can still be found for around $500 that is a block away from an express bus into Seattle.	It has improved a great deal in the last 20 years. Freeway through it is still a nightmare but downtown and the waterfront are great. And they hosted a US Open golf tournament last year.
907	That's some quality reporting there.	Rosie O'Donnell just went insane, just like Kanye.
908	It's hard to survive more than a few battles anyway so you'll be able to switch songs often enough.	I wish there was a randomize option for all songs you can pick in the Battle Tree. Seriously the songs are all so good. It really makes you apreciate how high the quality of the music is in these games.

911	That's because Biden debated Palin	"I try to spend a little time on my knees every day" Okay come on if it were Biden on the side of that table he'd trying to failing to contain his laughter.
912	Wow, I bet you fit in well here.	I'm Nigerian-American who was born and raised in America and I agree with all of these. I also feel bad for foreigners making assumptions because they don't know that usually, half the things they complain that Americans do is usually white Americans. I feel as if a lot of the issues don't concern the minorities of America (black, latino, and asian Americans).
913	I remember Romney saying this exact thing ~4 years ago and everybody called him crazy for it.	Short answer: Yes. And so focused on one narrow political debate that we've forgotten we have enemies who want to see all of us fail as a republic.
914	Well you guys can't have the teams AND the casters	he's aight. Truthfully, I think there is a bit too much from the American casting side, I'm sure EU (Britian specifically) has more to bring to the table. As an American I would like to see more balance in that regard. PS. You look just like one of my friends and I think it's funny whenever I see you on screen
915	i think the teeths are a little bit far from the mouth	Tried to draw BB with my eyes closed
916	I assume you get paid, what is the money like?	I am on my 7th year acting in a Haunted Attraction. Ask me anything! It's right around that time of year again... So I figured this would be entertaining. As the title said, I've just started my (about) 7th year working in a Haunted Attraction. I spent 6 years in one, and then bounced around helping friends out for a season, then took a couple years off, and now I'm back because I have no self control. Ask whatever you wish!
917	You mean I shouldn't have been using "his's", "hers's", "yours's" and "mine's" all this time?	Right, but apostrophes also denote possession most of the time for third person. Pronouns, like "his", "her", and "its" are exceptions. *Exceptions* are the bitch.
918	But I thought Apple had completely abandoned the pro market and all us of us at r/apple were switching to the Surface Desk so we can draw squiggly lines with our hands	New AMD GPUs spotted in macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta 5 kexts
919	Waiting till after the finals leaves no room for these kinds of posts tho	No it doesn't, kills don't directly corellate to mistakes (vision battle, near-kills, etc). VP is good, but can you at least wait until the finals? iGV isn't the same caliber as lgd, dc, eg, etc
920	Kicked his first ever FG to win the game.	How did your freshmen perform in their first game?
921	is there a difference?	"I like it in the butt" Also "I am not a lawyer" Those are not mutually exclusive

923	you're welcome :-Z	Jesus you strangled this joke to death
924	People have to be mad because remastering doesn't take time to do and they should just have given them everything at once	While I'm more inclined to agree with you, the reality is probably that the maps weren't ready for the full release, I don't imagine they had a full team working on this compared to infinite warfare. Plus it's free, freshens up the game ever so slightly so why complain really?
925	Perhaps Georgia is the only state doing it correctly	I'm going to guess we transition to a 4+ tier system to create more non-brewery jobs.
926	Well obviously you're an idiot because you didn't see the value in what they had.	When they get offended and start to push back when you tell them you're not interested.
927	Yeah	I'm not Canadian. Is that Jian Ghomeshi?
928	But then what would I do with all my Isenfyre Tokens....	Now that the iron banner vendor is permanently in the iron temple area can we permanently open the back area of the tower? Its just wasted space now, which is a shame because its very nice back there.
929	I don't think you would notice it with the context haha	Woah, that's actually pretty weird
930	You sound like mehdi himself	There is a shortcut. Don't describe the solution in a high level abstraction. Eating right + exercise doesn't really mean much to a person with no starting point. What you should have said IMO: Lift weights with an 8 week work out plan centered around squats and deadlifts at a frequency of every other day. Do 5x5 when lifting. Make sure to always calculate your weights by a 1rep max weight calculation once every 1-2 weeks. Macro diet, don't micro diet. Allow cheat meals, but keep them at a finite allowance. Use an excel sheet to track progress. That's it. After 8 weeks he won't have a problem anymore.
931	BECAUSE the article is in the SF Chronicle, of course.	That article doesnt say why its rooted in the bay area as opposed to LA. It just has a bunch of random tech orgs or(non profits) that do anti trump events or meetings. I think we have people all over doing this. I actually think NYC is firmly anti trump, they live next to the guy for one.
932	Realized he was still on the Braves when he broke his ankle, but I left up the video anyway.	"As a Giant"

934	right... I must of forgot to put	which would cause a lot of inflation as the value of the dollar would plummet

936	we have to have 10x the military capacity of the rest of the world see, no fucking need for healthcare and education	"Stop complaining and work harder and you can be rich too!" Don't complain the rules are rigged, just keep quiet and play the goddamn game! -First part a quote from my Fox News viewing, Trumpeteer father. My response? "Yeah I don't need to be rich, I just want a comfortable, stable life, in our super rich Country, to be allowed to see a doctor, regardless of my employment status, to be offered a level of education appropriate for today's realities, and to not allow people to go hungry, even if they fuck up and make mistakes or have shitty luck." Nah, that's crazy...we only have an $18+ Trillion annual economic output, where would we find the money???

938	Burglars have sued in the past for damage they incurred while breaking in (I think one of the more famous cases dealt with a burglar falling through a skylight).	Putting something in the fridge doesn't mean that the whole office now owns whatever I packed for lunch. Theft is theft. I am unsure why a thief has any expectation to what they will be getting when they steal. Would a thief have any legitimate grounds to sue if they broke into a bank and hurt themselves getting out?

943	You can't a have a pole if the Earth's flat, duh	What? Why not? It's a place that exists regardless of who lives there.
944	Damn, you could've got sent to federal prison!	My school was making "time capsules" and putting "memories" inside that we were supposed to open up our senior year (I was in 4th grade at the time). I wrote a letter confessing my love to a pretty girl in my class, however I signed it with my best friends name. Apparently, the teachers read everything that went into the time capsule and I was promptly called down to the principals office. I, as a fourth grader, got suspended for three days for forgery.
945	Oh, then it's completely fine for everybody.	Nah, I have ADHD and without my meds i would not function at all. Already dropped twice from school and since my meds getting straight A's.
946	Very clever, well done!	Hi! Yes, I am using the vive controller for hand tracking. I would love to substitute this by leap motion once the engine has it supported! To toggle the single finger pointing posture, the player would have to press the Shoulder(R) button (the one above the trackpad) with his/her index finger. So basically you have to do the same pointing gesture with your hand to use the touchscreen. And even my non-gamer girlfriend says it makes her think that she is actually touching the screen! Thank you for your feedback:)
947	He is an amazing OOP running back in Madden outside of the ghosts has highest speed of any running back.	Tavon Austin. It's not his fault, really. He does what he can and is a dynamic player with the football in hands. The Rams just made an awful decision agreeing to pay that much money.
948	But don't you know they were meant to have lots of children?	Does anyone on earth see another child for them right now as a good idea? Seriously.

952	Tin foil hats!	Yep it is so annoying, it's almost like EA wants you to go on streaks like this... Top players might not get affected much by this, but for average players like myself it's just discouraging
953	My heart breaks a little everytime I throw a portal to escape and expect to see my allies follow after me, but instead they get collapsed on and die as they try as best they can to waddle under the tower...	PSA: Friendlies can go through Gideon's portal Just wanted everyone to know that since I rarely see anyone take use of it which this could save lives.
954	Awesome!	I found this awesome lake

959	B-b-but Emily Rogers says they are ahead of schedule!	I'm writing this going off the assumption that this article can be taken seriously: Yup, this is pretty much exactly what I figured was going down. Nintendo chose a far too ambitious launch date of March 2017 and now they're scrambling to try and meet it. I think that it's a good time to start emotionally preparing for the worst case scenario, that is a full delay of the launch until June/July 2017. It's seeming like best case scenario is a short run to make the March 2017 launch window and keep investors happy, with mass market stock not being available until Summer. I'm guessing as well that Breath of the Wild will also be getting delayed until Summer 2017 if this happens. If they launch BotW in March and people can't play it, they're just going to piss off their market base and poison the well leaving investors infuriated. If it's delayed until Summer 2017 though, I could see ports of Smash Bros. and Splatoon being ready for the launch, which would be cool and it would give considerably less hang time before the new Mario and Pokemon games that are supposedly coming next year. This is if Nintendo doesn't do their reveal until October of course. Maybe they're further along and more confident about their launch window than everything seems and we could still see a reveal this month, but it is looking considerably less likely now.
960	Price is a bust	I just got here, what did I miss?
961	Yeah but hes a blue so he's automatically worse	Over the last three years Hall has played 210 games, Steen has played 209. Hall has put up .87PPG, Steen's put up .85PPG. But Steen also has that great two way play going for him. Doesn't seem so clear cut to me.
962	TIL: I can live forever off of heroin, as long as I stay away from the booze.	Relevant: Most heroin deaths occur with a mixture of alcohol and heroin. Oddly similar, most JW offenses to themselves occurs with a mixture of alcohol and Watchtower.

990	But how else will the get the back draft dodger achievement	You know what I'd really like? An airblaster. A flamethrower that allows you to airblast faster, more often. Because there is nothing I hate more that the fact that airblasting has the EXACT SAME ATTACK SPEED as any rocket launcher. So if someone shoots a rocket at you and you fail to reflect that, as long as that soldiers keeps shooting at you, IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REFLECT ANY OF THOSE ROCKETS.
991	Yup, that's inacceptable, they are called "great Germanic people of the great empire"	Generalising much, no? Also "germanic people"? Really?
992	Their clearly celebrating Hosni's son and the Muslim Brotherhood!

I wouldn't count on the ball bumbling around in the box like that week in week out. I thought he was good but he didn't catch my eye. I thought players like Iwobi were actually better. I absolutely agree that Walcott is a good option right now but I personally don't think I'll be transferring him in.

1024	On the other hand, most religious people belong to two religions that agree on virtually nothing, except that it's all the Jews' fault.	And that's what bugs me about any kind of "all religions ________" philosophy. Like take the afterlife, almost every religion has contradictory teachings about it. Does it even exist? Is it state of consciousness? Do you get there by works or by faith? Is there a negative afterlife like Hell, or are we trapped in a reincarnation cycle here on until we reach a positive afterlife? Who is God? Is God personal or impersonal? Does God intervene in human affairs or is God the proverbial watchmaker? Is God sentient, or merely a creating force? What about Jesus? Was He a liar, a lunatic, or Lord? Did He even exist? Was He a prophet? A human messiah? The incarnate God? Yeah, every religion has ridiculously simple common themes like "don't be a dick". But once you get beyond the Golden Rule, the different religions of the world are wildly different.

Even though I spent all of my savings on Down Payment, I wanted to do some upgrades before moving in so I went into a little debt doing that... it's not unmanageable, but my concern is that I have it in a lot of different places - different credit accounts with different banks, etc... About $15,000 worth.. At my current rate I would think it would take about 1 year to pay it all off. My question is, should I take out some sort of low interest loan, pay all them off and just worry about paying ONE loan back at a fixed interest? Will this end up saving me some interest costs? Or should I keep them all separated? Thanks

1045	We traded away our 4th pick in the 2018 Superdraft for DCU's 4th pick in the 2019 Superdraft and Aguilar's rights.	right! thanks. i saw that headline this morning, but evidently was paying zero attention as i read it. what did we giv up for him?
1046	They probably listened to Korn on set and figured they would get all Nu Metal fans in on the movie	What do you mean by that? I know it was released around the time that nu metal was becoming popular but what characteristics make them similar?

1048	This right here, destroy the Democrats and let the Republicans splinter into Libertarian/Religious/Nationalist parties afterwards if we need more than one party.

1054	Gore clearly still has the choice necessary, yeah he isn't going to pull out a 90 yard TD run, but you don't need that shit if your Oline has chemistry and can run block well, alongside with good play calling.	Why do people still think our oline is shit in the run game. This isnt a Gore show people, the OLine is giving him on average 2 or 3 yards of push. Put some young legs behind that and it could be dangerous. Our line is young and has flaws in passing. But run blocking has been near elite this year.
1055	You're hilarious.	susano
1056	Alright guys, no woman president, back to rampant sexism, burn the whore.	The hate toward Melania makes me cringe so hard.

1060	I don't think we have the personnel to beat them at that game tonight.	Stars vs Oilers run and gun? Really if we think about it, the Oilers have been doing well really because of there ability to run and gun, as well as rushing the net. The Oilers much like the Stars are lacking on defense, but however I think tonight the Stars need to beet the Oilers at there own own game of run and gun, and rushing talbot at the net. What do you guys think?
1061	I still think that it was the immense crowds that scared Shil and her posse, thus the "he draws a bunch of hippies and kids who don't vote" talking point.	Just a drive-by reminder that Bernie had, easily, a thousand times as much total rally attendance as Hillary did. Easily. You can rig the media, the polls, and the voting machines, but rigging a stadium full of people is a whole lot more difficult, obviously.

Totally worth it imo. It doesn't really hurt the legit players and improves the game quality by quite a bit (at least in my experience). Also, getting a new phone number may be easy in some countries, but it is an issue in others.

Basically T-Mobile will finance me a phone for 24 months(interest free) but will buy it back for half the initial loan after 6 months. The program allows you to upgrade more often.
1072	Shit son, Michael was a great boss.	I think this is related to the idea of "being promoted to the height of one's incompetence." Basically you get promoted for doing well until you no longer do well, then you get stuck at a level where you're no longer effective. Like Michael Scott from the American version of The Office. Great paper salesman. Terrible boss.

1117	Thanks for the heads up, I also have a 1512+ but running SHR and no expansion bay, I will hold off from this update.	Volume Crash after DSM 6.0.2-8451 Update 6 Hey everyone, I am in a bit of a pickle. I have DSM auto update set up for a DS1512+ with a DX513 expansion unit. I have a backup pointed to another DS1512+ unit, so not all is lost. After the DSM update it appears that my Volume 1 has crashed. All 5 disks are showing that they are Normal when I run a SMART test on them. I can see my shared folders in my control panel, but when I go to open them I get a read only/disk may have crashed text box and I am unable to see their contents. This NAS is set up as a RAID 5 w data protection. I am unable to backup the files manually as I do not have access to them. Is it safe to reset or shutdown and reboot the system? I have never run into this issue before so I don't want to go and make any changes before consulting some forums an opinions. I have reached out to Synology and the Synology forum too. What do you all think?
1118	I seriously doubt a Saudi prince has 1 "wife".	Idk, but saw his wife before and she was a hottie
1119	that was really insightful, thank you!	In the U.S., the 'estate' inherits the debts - meaning that if your parents had $10k USD in debts, collectors would claim any money (up to that amount) that was in your parents possession, then moving onto money taken from sold assets. There's a few exceptions. In some cases, certain debts do get inherited - such as medical bills (but only in certain states). Additionally, if you were to inherit a house with an outstanding mortgage, the debt would stay with the house and transfer to the new owner, a.k.a. you. If you decide you don't want the house (and thus the debt), you could tell the bank that owns the mortgage to foreclose. In this case, the bank would sell the house and keep the money they received for selling it. As an example - let's say my parents had $5k in their savings account and $10k in credit card debt. The credit companies would take the $5k (even if that money was specifically left to me in their will) and I would be left with no debts, but no inheritance either. Of course, this completely goes out the window if you cosigned any loans with your parents - cosigning means you have complete liability to repay.

The thing I find odd is here all these families are living and working together - but it seems like the "family values" folks are the ones who overwhelmingly trash millennials for living at home. If things are ok at your parent's home, they welcome your living there and you like it as well, why not?
1132	Yeah, but a "devilish sacrifice" was mentioned in the Totland Chapter and Jaji's helmet and nose totally form the Sacrificial Brand, so this is legit.

When it is in use, urine only comes into contact with an area the size of a pea before a muscular sphincter is closed preventing further flow. Throughout the entire day the surface of my dick is at the same level of dirtiness or cleanliness as the side of my arm.

1208	Those random "environmental" gas attacks could only distort your vision without damaging you, so there won't be any complaints about dying for something random.	I agree, I think it would add something to the ambiance of the game if there were randomized gas attacks/arty bombardments every once in a while, though the arty bombardment should be a much rarer occurrence, and should probably be localized (with a 30 second warning to the players in the target area) instead of map-wide, as dying to what is essentially a randomly occurring "act of god" to which you have no effective answer to isn't really a fun gameplay mechanic. With a gas attack, you can at least put on your mask (which makes for an interesting change of pace in gameplay), whereas high explosive shells just kill you.
1209	Are you even old enough to vote?	Trump supporter here. Clinton clearly won the debate tonight. Still doesn't change my stance that I like Trump more. And Still doesn't mean I'm willing to go out of my way and vote for him though. Fuck voting.
1210	Suburban Sprawl Hell.	For that to work they need to start building more than 2 stories high. This is becoming a problem in my city on the east coast as well.

1213	Nice try, Ken Bone.	As much as the wording sucks and people have a right to be angry over it, there's a reason this is proposed. And it's not evil greedy corporations. Thank you for having some sense. Even people who own solar rely on the grid (otherwise this amendment would be meaningless). All this is gonna do is make it so you can't put power back on the grid for the same price you buy it for. That's pretty common.

Both of my parents raised me in a Christian home. Over the last couple years my mother had noticed that I had "fallen away from god". I had tried to keep it a secret but evidently I suck. However we have a civil conversation about my beliefs, she still wants me find god one day, which is fair enough, however our relationship is unaffected.

1295	We won't have free speech, but at least we will have all of those great coal jobs back.	The media is in a bind. Trump has successfully neutered them for half the country. He has cover for anything he does by saying the left-wing media are "disgraceful liars". That's all he has to say, over and over, and people who want to believe it will believe it. That's how he survived scandal after scandal during the campaign that would have killed off anyone else. The double-down tactic works. Now that he is president, he will start taking control of the media in unique ways. Today, he had a behind-closed-doors meeting with heads of major media networks. Trump may be a complete ignoramus in practically every other area, but when it comes to controlling media coverage, he is a savant. That is what makes an authoritarian like him in this position so dangerous to free speech.

1302	build loads of software that only you know about	New to the profession, and working for a small company. How to assess progress toward becoming a "senior" engineer? As the title says, I'm new to software engineering. I'm a boot camp graduate and I've been working as a front-end developer for a great company for about 9 months now. I've learned a ton, and because it's such a small team, I've had the opportunity to take a lot of ownership over my work. The flipside, though, is that the mentorship I've received has come largely from the backend team. I'm grateful for the "general engineering life lessons" stuff that's given me, but very little of it is specific to how I write my code. I know there's no checklist of technologies or concepts that, on its own, makes a person junior or senior, but I'd like to address my technical weaknesses and try to move forward. I know that a lot of what makes a senior engineer is the ability to mentor others, and that's in short supply on my team. Here's what I'm sort of planning on over the next few months. Can anyone point out to me if any of this just looks silly? - Learn another language (Python?). - Become more proficient and disciplined with TDD (it's a company-wide weakness). - Learn object-oriented CSS (it's not actually relevant to my job, since we use React inline styles and Radium, but it seems like a resume hole). - Master vim and tmux (I use Sublime vintage mode, which Sublime users and vim users find equally infuriating). - Learn more sysops and AWS stuff. - Learn Docker. - Check out Angular 2.

1314	Lol Alex is a loser	High School Sweetheart When I was a freshman in high school, I met Alex. Now, ten years later, I couldn't tell you why I was so drawn to him, or why I got so attached. He was homely and odd and quite frequently smelled bad. There was a darker undercurrent that ran below his surface, and I thought I saw unspoken sadness that matched mine, and maybe as a naive 15 year old, I had the stereotypical "we can save each other from our pain" bullshit fantasy. He wasn't the only boy giving me attention (in fact, he barely even gave me that, since he played me hot and cold- emphasis on the cold) but he was the one I wanted. Every time I would start to pull away and give up because he was clearly uninterested, he would pop up, calling me cute and making comments about how seeing me brightens his day. Then he would be back to pursuing someone else. I was 15 and naive and hurt, but still finally had enough. So I decided I was done. He caught wind of this and ended up asking me to be his girlfriend later that same day. I was caught off guard but thought "yes finally, he must have just needed time to make a move!" He and I dated for two years, and he was a hurricane the entire time. One example: His phone would be off for days at a time, he rarely went to school, and I just wouldn't hear from him. I would finally call his mom because I was worried about not hearing from him at all for three, four, five days, and she would tell me that she hadn't seen him either. When he finally turned his phone back on, he would spit venom at me and call me a "crazy cunt" because I spammed his phone. I would be in tears and trying to explain I was worried because I hadn't heard from him in days and neither had his mother, and then he would call me a few other names and hang up on me and turn his phone off. The abuse came in many ways, but disappearing and then cussing me out and calling me names when I voiced how uncomfortable it made me... That was his favorite. I kept trying to break up with him, but whenever I did that, suddenly he was calling me crying and saying I was the love of his life and he was going to kill himself if I left him. After two years, I finally had enough and I ended it for good. I told him I was done. I ignored his threats of suicide. He kept begging. School was out for the summer so he couldn't find me there, which meant he kept showing up at my house. Afternoon, evening, middle of the night. It didn't matter. He would toss bits of bark (that my mom had in planters in the front yard) at my bedroom window. He would sit out there for a long time trying to get me to talk to him. I didn't know what to do. I thought he would give up and that it would be okay soon. One day I was walking home from work, I was a block away from my house, and Alex came sidling up next to me in his car, pleading with me to talk to him. I told him I had nothing more to say. "Then let me talk, please," he begged. He was crying. I had no intention of getting back together with him, but I still hated seeing him hurt. I agreed to let him say what he wants so he could get closure. I sat in the car and told him to talk. He started babbling incoherently and kept trying to make me feel bad for "abandoning him." I told him the conversation was over and I was leaving. He locked the doors and as I went to manually push the lock on my door up, he grabbed my arm and told me I wasn't leaving. I panicked. I smacked him and shoved him away from me and scrambled out of the car, and ran the rest of the block home. He continued to lurk. Spammed my inbox, drove by my house and place of employment. I ended up rebounding and started dating someone new. He was Alex's complete opposite and made me feel happy and light. However, once Alex caught news of this, he flipped out. He went ballistic. The calls and texts increased both in frequency and in level of mania. He started hanging out right outside of the store I worked at. It was a small store in the mall, so I could see him, just standing there staring in at me. Management had to call mall security a few times, but he always came back. Eventually his texts got threatening. He started saying things about how he hoped my new boyfriend was "prepared," and he said that he was willing to go to jail to have me. My mom panicked and believed that I was on the verge of being kidnapped or assaulted. We had gone to the cops a couple times but they said they couldn't do anything because he technically hadn't broken any laws. We took the threatening messages to them and they said they would start to file a restraining order and go warn him that he couldn't go near me or talk to me or he was in violation of the order of protection. He kept showing up anyway. One night, around midnight, the doorbell rang. My mom was confused and asked if I was expecting anyone. I told her no. She opened the door and there, on the front step, was a card, a rose, and a burning candle. We glanced up and down the street and didn't see anyone, and we were immediately spooked because there wasn't enough time for him to ring the doorbell and get out of sight already (you could see a long way down both sides of the street) unless he was hiding in the trees along the house. This went on for a while, he kept following me and showing up at my work, which means he kept getting visited by the cops, and his friends even got involved and started threatening me for "what I was doing to him." Eventually the order of protection was placed, and all at once everything stopped. But my paranoia and fear and jumpiness lasted for a long time after that. TLDR; Got into abusive relationship, dude flipped out and stalked me when I finally left him.

1323	What if it's jill	The voice in the phone is Ada Wong. I'm sure this has been said already but the voice on the phone is Ada Wong (Or an Ada Clone). No doubt in my mind. She not only has Ada's Voice, but the exact same characteristic inflections as Ada Wong when speaking on a phone. When was the last time we heard Ada speak on the phone to someone? Why, resident evil 6, of course.
1324	Just put Cravens on the line, that kid can play anywhere!	Kawann Short is going to get a big contract. Calais Campbell as well, although I doubt he's leaving Arizona. Johnathan Hankins from the Giants is somebody that will probably hit FA. They just paid premier DT money to Damon Harrison. I don't think it makes sense to spend that much money on two DT's instead of other spots. P.S. In case you couldn't tell, I want the Skins to sign a DT in free agency. Bennie Logan and Brandon Williams are also options.
1325	We have the best speaking style, don't we folks?	It's so creepy how you cultists have copied your cult leader's speaking style.

1330	Yeah Al-Qaeda "Army of Jihad" were the good guys protecting civilians in Aleppo, how dare Russia and Syria remove them	With the Syrian rebel forces withdrawing this was unfortunately only a matter of time. This is an absolute nightmare.

1335	Life sentences for people who at the time of their crime (any crime) couldn't even sign a document or provide consent is utterly inhumane.	Protecting the public has to come first. Never let these people out again and you won't have to worry about "teaching them anything".
1336	Formatting only works in the body, same as tagging a user or sub.	ugh. formatting not my strong suit apparently.
1337	Pangy is the team apparently	oh man i love pangy
1338	But are you sure we can't catch stupidity from breathing the air.	If it makes you feel any better, if you order from the company I work for you are getting clean, rural Midwest air in them.
1339	I think you forgot this	Giving people healthcare that they didn't earn robs them of their noble right of self reliance. They may have healthy bodies but they'll have sick souls.
1340	Iedereen weet toch dat cultuur een linkse hobby is.	Valt best mee, onder dat geblaat over de Nederlandse cultuur zijn ze toch tegen cultuursubsidies, het koningshuis, onze cultuur van tolerantie en respect, etc.
1341	How long have you been using kratom daily?	How to prevent kratom withdrawals Hey, I am currently drinking 4g kratom almost every day to get stuff done when being stressed out too much. Usually I don't do it that often. Now I wanted to do a break from those tasks and therefore stop comsuming kratom for a couple of days. I started with the break today and I feel kinda empty inside, a little depressed. Could I do something like microdosing in order to counter these effects and just slowly reduce the kratom intake day by day?
1342	Happy anniversary!	I had a really good year. My husband got a promotion and a nice bonus in March. He now gets to work from home full time, which allows me to work a part time job and we are not so strapped for cash or praying for him to get some overtime that they never offer anymore. My kids are growing and happy, all three of them. My husband and I are happily married. We know that we are lucky to have found each other. We have our problems, but none so serious as to ever have to consider something like separating or divorce. This coming March we will be officially together 10 years (we have known each other for 16 years), celebrating our 6 year wedding anniversary in January. All in all its been a calm year for us personally. Makes me worry about what 2017 will bring. Hopefully more of the boring same.

1348	Why not a 390?	Buy a Titan XP and call it a day.
1349	It does to many voters, and that should matter.	I completely agree with that statement. That does not equal "rigging", however.
1350	You believe the cross-section of America she is referring to will be motivated to be more tolerant based on shame?	I think she's doing that by shaming bigots.
1351	Is this in preparation for a Josh Sitton contract?	Bears have informed Pro Bowl kicker Robbie Gould that he is being released, league source tells ESPN.
1352	hopefully by the time he gets injured ive won my league	Great. Miller will be a legit RB1 and Foster will be great until he gets his annual injury.
1353	Who cares about people's right to self-determination as long as they are voting for me?	The GOP defense is "We aren't depriving African Americans of their right to vote because they're black, we're doing it because they are Democrats!" That is not better holy shit.
1354	Lmao so anybody who downvotes this stupid post isn't a decent person, makes perfect sense	1) Make a post that makes you and decent people smile. 2) Wait for the cockroaches to emerge. 3) Laugh at the sound of things getting crushed by boots.

1365	Part of me thinks this kind of bait and switch would actually work and we should do it but part of me thinks oil on Mars (even if it were real) wouldn't matter unless there were brown aliens to nuke freedom into.	I still think the easiest way is just drop hints about all the untapped oil on Mars.
1366	Following things without questioning them always leads to great things.	Over 1436 years ago, when a child was born, the Prophet (PBUH) made it his sunnah to take a small part of a date and place it in his mouth. He would then chew it until it was soft and then rub it onto the palate of the new born baby. This is called Tahneek. Today, BBC News has reported that "experts" have said - "A dose of sugar given as a gel rubbed into the inside of the cheek is a cheap and effective way to protect premature babies against brain damage" This is why Muslims follow the sunnah of the messenger without questioning it.
1367	Duh it's the *cough* *cough* mentioned in *cough* that makes them immune to radiation.	Children of atom I have just a quick question about the children of atom. With an entire cult built around radiation and then they spend most of their lives in said radiation how have they not turned into ghouls or feral ghouls?

1376	Yeah, weed legalization is way more important than the prevention of private prisons, or the TPP, or any of the other things that Gary Johnson might not fight for.	Yeah, being able to be put in prison for smoking doesn't affect them at all! They're totally the least affected.

With a squad of ragtags shakes up the scene. Gets signed by one of the biggest teams. Finds out his new best friend and captain is actually the villain. Realises winning isn't the most important thing. Turns against his former best friend for what is right with an underdog team. Wins TI 7 and gets the girl.
1382	wow such a huge fine for them	Comcast fined $2.3 million for mischarging customers

1387	It's not a legitimate 1G because Taric isn't Summit, duh	Not a legitimate 1G, the 1G scenario was he burned in a Molly before defusing the bomb in a 1v0 when there was no time constraints or anything. This is just a death to his own Molly
1388	Yeah honestly its a fucking shame that people in dia play for fun how can these ignorant assholes do that	No Faker, this is exactly who we are. It all starts with solo queue. Because in our region there's only 2 things anyone cares about, memes and streaming. People say solo queue in regions like EUW and Korea are extremely toxic, that's partly because the players there care a lot about winning, way more than the players in NA at least. Our region just doesn't give a fuck. I've played in mid-high diamond the last 2 seasons and most players in most games simply don't care about anything other than "having fun." I get that it's a game but when the main goal of the majority of players in the region's most competitive queue is to just "have fun" then there's something wrong. I don't think the region will move on to greater heights unless the mindset here changes, which seems highly unlikely.
1389	THEY GO LOW WE GO HIGH	1. Fire Bomb a State GOP HQ. 2. Liberals react by donating money to these Republicans.
1390	Everything is a give and take	We have passionate fans, but most of the just talk crap to each other over a computer. We don't have organized hooligans who'll stampede and kill people over a game, but we do get an occasional fight in the crowd or parking lot that turns very bad. One one hand, Americans are a little more civil over sports than Europeans, but on the other hand Americans love their guns and shooting people everyday.
1391	Well you sound like a fantastic parent.	as a mother, am I the only one around here who is sick to death of helping their dumbass children with homework?? some days I like feel I should of had an abortion :( I cant do this anymore

1395	That one always stings the most.	You know Obamacare was a Republican proposition, right?
1396	Or they're both crooked and full of shit.	Drudge and the RNC lie about the Clinton Foundation while the Trump uses the Foundation that bears *his* name to bribe politicians investigating Trump's crooked business dealings and purchase giant paintings of himself.

1411	I'm going guess the US is not one of these countries with good consumer protection laws...	Do you have Apple Care? If so, you should be able to get it fixed or replaced. If you didn't buy the extra apple care, and it's more than a year old and you're not from a country with good consumer protection laws, then you're probably out of luck.
1412	Keep it up, man.	I made it a week clean and sober! I am so grateful that I never have to go to bed again wondering if I'll wake up. The past week in AA has done more good than I ever imagined. Thank you all for posting and inspiring me.
1413	I guffawed.	I let out a muted howl.
1414	Cus league of legends is life	Why are you on Reddit right now instead of spending time with your family?
1415	Yeah, I don't really understand how this earnings call differs much from their quarterly deliveries announcement (aside from just talking in raw $ amounts)	I feel like the results of q3 earnings is already priced in...not anticipating much movement.

Title says most, but just for reference I have most gobblegums, but no more perkaholics. I'm looking to do the EE so if you guys can give advice that'd be awesome.
1420	Oh, fuck you	when people put their emotions first rather than intelligence, I've seen people post the truth on Reddit and get voted down by multiple people
1421	I just can't decide, but I think the cards winning might be a little better.	It's tough to decide who I want to win between the Cards and the Falcons. Obviously if the Falcons win, the Cards are another game back on us should we win, or stay three games back should the Buccs score the upset. On the other hand, a Cards win/'Hawks win pulls us away from the NFC South in the race for a bye in the playoffs. Though also brings the Panthers back into that divisional race, which isn't what we want before we play them. I'm conflicted.
1422	Sure, but at that point you'll have more immediate problems like losing all your bank accounts.	Until quantum computing scales high enough to break modern encryption. Then they can decrypt all that stored data or even select certain portions flagged from important IPs or ranges

1428	This is literally the only subreddit I've seen where people are making this excuse.	I highly suggest you go and see how he did the same thing regarding Planned Parenthood and see how that ended up in the end. He's done this over and over and it's so far always turned out to be bullshit. So I would wait until we find out all of the information. There's been a lot of jumping to conclusion from Trump supporters lately and it's getting a bit ridiculous

1436	"No need to look any farther" Even if God did it, the how would still be under consideration.	Why is it so hard to say that consciousness is an emergent property of a sufficiently complex and flexible computational framework? It's equivalent to saying "consciousness is just what brains do", but far more useful. It's the difference between saying " The universe began, and we're not quite sure how." and "God did it, no need to look any further." It makes no sense...
1437	Cat.	Donald Trump blocks release of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC. "Country is too PC as it is" Gives game a 10/10. "You can kill so many Mexicans".
1438	Youtubers, take note.	If you are ever in a situation where you have to apologize. Give one heartfelt apology and move on. Repeatedly apologizing will only make it worse.
1439	Kemba Walker, Kobe Bryant, LeBron, Durant, Westbrook, Harden.	Who's the player that always seems to go off against your team? Some guys just have great matchups, others get extra hyped, then there are the scrubs/role players that have a few good games a year, but almost always against your team.
1440	But that increases the chance of it become a poo.	Sit down to pee, it gives you a chance to get a little reading done.

1445	It was because they took a wrong turn which led them to the assassin (who had actually given up and gone for a sandwich) and by the time they realised they went the wrong way, and tried to turn around, Franz was ded.	True, however, WW1 tanks were kinda unstable. I don't have statistics about how many tanks or other vehicles stuck into mud or engine broke suddenly but I bet, a lot. If I remember right, the assassin got change to shoot Frans Ferdinand because his car stall because it tried move backwards. Those engines wasn't so good back in the day.
1446	Na ja der Mindestlohn ist nur renatbel wann die Wirtschaft gut ist	Mindestlohn: Das ist aus den Warnungen des SVR geworden
1447	i think they just forgot to turn it on at this point now	Any idea why ranked team queue isn't up yet?
1448	You forgot the	I don't believe I've ever been ripped off by my bank. They provide me valuable services and, with my current accounts, charge me $0. They reap rewards from investing the money I store there, but that's OK. If I wanted to invest it, I would, but I like to keep some of it liquid.
1449	Fucking lieberman.	That's not true though. When we had the majority in both we passed the ACA and if it hadn't been for Lieberman it would have had a public option. Obama also passed the stimulus, which would have been even stronger if the senate had been more progressive. Obama was never filibuster proof at any point so he always had to concede some to the GOP. He also signed a law requiring equal pay for women, and lifted the ban on stem cell research. This kind of rhetoric FEELS GOOD to progressives who loathe the slow pace of change but it's simply not accurate. The failure is on the DNC to not get this message out. They always play defense instead.

1453	izi quests 4Head	Ye that was my case, got 5k mmr but didn't play unranked. So during battlepass I did my quests in unranked, everyone was around 2,5k, it was crazy, but after like 20-30 games I got into the mid 4ks with 90% WR.
1454	Yeah religions are a weird thing.	That's just one of many disturbing things in the bible that a good majority of the world believes in. Though to be fair, if you told the majority of christians/catholics that this is was in the bible, they probably wouldn't believe you as pastors/reverends usually tend to skip these stories in church as I'm pretty sure it would turn them off of religion.
1455	He also didn't pull the troops out of Iraq until 2012 and Afghanistan until 2015, which is akin to sending them in the first place.	He wasn't in office when Iraq and Afghanistan were illegally invaded.

1459	Because nothing bad has ever happens strolling into the unknown.	He may or may not be able to deliver on his promises. We don't know yet. What we do know, is that things will be different. Americans are tired of career politics, corruption and geopolitical meddling. The DNC and Hillary have no one to blame but themselves. I'll gladly take a stroll into the unknown to see 'business as usual' shaken to its core.

1469	Oh no how dare someone pay the posted price for something	Well I learned one today- millennials seem to think that ANY and EVERY purchase they will make has a finite price on the tag. That means buying a car at full price and considering anyone who haggles to be an entitled ass. Supposedly it even carries over to craigslist purchases!
1470	scaboon	It'll be something exciting to capture everyone. Something we haven't had before. Something like a melee fighter. Maybe they will even have a leap attack.

1472	That describes me perfectly	Does anyone else become "mute" when they're depressed? When I'm overly stressed or depressed, I don't say a word. Even when my family talks to me, I don't reply. I just sit and stare and sometimes I don't even acknowledge that I've heard what they've said.

1480	If you've got nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about us looking over your shoulder at your browsing habits.	Is it that difficult to let them look at your receipt for literally 5 seconds and then move on? If he didn't steal anything he shouldn't have an issue with letting them see it.
1481	So it's like Tinder, but with a much smaller predicted user count.	App for in hotels Does anyone know of the existence of an app that allows people to hook up in hotels when on business travel. So this is not just a dating app but an app focused on hotel sector. The idea is that when someone is in hotel A in country X, he could post a message in the app (or share profile). If someone else happens to be also in hotel A in that country X, they could meet up for a drink or casual sex etc... This is the digital version of meeting someone in the bar of the hotel and have a one night stand.

1486	I got one today too.	May I present to you.... A TEXTLESS SAUCE PACKET!!! (What would you put on it?)
1487	Oh yeah youre going to want on of these:	The thing they drew on the can is pretty hard to make out but it just looks like your average shit tier tagging. Is there more to it that I'm missing?

Well what are we doing now to our own people? EJK, anyone? Now I'm not equating Native Americans with druggies but I think before we draw judgment against Europeans we should first look at ourselves and what we are doing with our own people.
1502	And this would be why I would honk as well	Yeah this guy had slowed down and stopped well before the merge point after exiting a highway (with highway speed traffic behind him). He could have easily merged if he maintained his speed and used the whole merge lane instead of stopping at the beginning of the merge lane for no reason. Stopping unnecessarily after exiting a highway is just asking to be rear ended.

1506	Coffee date?	I want to say it was about 2010, or whenever that incident involving a dude asking a woman for a coffe date (at an inappropriate time) happened. Somehow that got blown out of proportion and it was when I started to see a lot of the athiest faces start to be more open of their reactionary beliefs. There was an anti-theist undercurrent that developed when Intelligent design popped up, (or perhaps even before, it's easy to be resentful when everybody in your community expects you to be Christian) while the War on Terrorism made open islamophobia from anti-theism acceptable. I feel like I see the some of the pieces that caused this, but I can't quite fit them together, and I'm missing the piles of pieces from the general reactionary wave cropping up.

This should be an EU-wide measure because now those Afghans are probably off to Sweden or Germany.

1520	That's all huh 30 acres piece of cake!	I would set up one router as the gateway/dhcp server. Then set the other two to forward dhcp requests to that router. I recently had an equipment manufacturer screw up my day. It turns out the new robot they installed could be connected to the network (which they did without consulting me, the IT manager). It also happened to have a cheap router in it with dhcp turned on. So I started getting all these calls that various things had stopped working. Then a pattern started to emerge. All these computers, devices, etc. were things without static addresses. I essentially had a rogue dhcp server somewhere on the network. Luckily, our facility only covers 30 acres, so that was easy to track down :-/

1527	Blizzard takes that kind of shit seriously for liability reasons.	I used to play a lot of World of Warcraft when I was younger. Was all about it with my buddies, huge nerds. One time they were coming out with a patch that fucked my characters class over. I was raging about it with my friends and we have pretty dark humor so I submitted a ticket to a blizzard mod, saying i was gonna /wrists myself if they follow through with the patch. It was funny imo. Next morning about 8 am I'm on the computer and I hear knocking on the door, my mom opens up the door to 2 cops asking if I'm alive.

She should just give up a perk slot for your convenience because the whole world revolves around you.
1533	Come on, everybody knows the whole reason the economy is in the dumps is because Obama hates businesses, so these companies like Exxon can't afford to hire anybody.	They're actually pretty vocal about it. Visit Republican and conservative sub-Reddits, Facebook, YouTube, etc. They actually love him for it: "He said he was going to do this the whole time!"

1561	Wtf that sample size is too low	Experiment results: How Leeching gets more loot. Recently, with the ice tomb event, i decided to run a test, determining whether i received more loot from leeching or helping. My results were shocking. In a sample size of nearly 100 ice tombs, totaling around 200 chests, leeching earned me 10 times more loot than helping. Why, you may ask? Because 0 times 10 is 0 :)
1562	But it's based on performance!	This is why our promotion system shouldn't be based on a test.
1563	Pretty sure this is a well established and known theory	1984: Oceania is an isolated hermit-state a la North Korea This theory is from quite an older topic compared to others on this board, but it's still interesting. POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD My theory is that in the classic book/movie *1984*, Oceania is not a world-spanning superstate like it is described, but is simply a delusional dictatorship controlling the former United Kingdom and nothing else. Some evidence for this: -Winston never sees any real proof of Oceania's existence outside Airstrip One. -"The Book", which assures the existence of the 3 superstates, was written by the Ministry of Truth, therefore it's unreliable. -The photo of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford in New York could've easily been forged. -It is stated somewhere (I can't remember where) that the rocket bombs falling on London are fired by the Party itself and not Eurasia. -Given what O'Brien said about plastic surgeons being able to transform someone, the "war prisoners" could've easily been political prisoners transformed into "Mongoloids" by plastic surgeons. -It would explain why wartime losses can easily turn into victories. -It simply makes a lot more sense than 3 superstates dominating the world (remember Occam's Razor). -It would explain why there are no Americans, Brazilians, South Africans, or really any non-Brits seen during the book (if Oceania really is that big. you'd expect to see Oceanians from other countries. Please, all thoughts and comments are accepted.

1571	Not just games, 30 Days RMA is pretty much standard for anything you buy, even online.	It's the same as any game that you buy from a store. If you buy a game and the standard policy is 30 days, it's still 30 days even if you didn't play the game or open the packaging. If it's past 30 days and you didn't play the game, that is entirely your own fault. It is not 30 days of play time, it's 30 days AFTER the purchase. After that trade the game for a lesser value or sell it yourself online for more.

It was things like this that give me rose colored glasses for WoW. I remember when you used to be able to climb your way to the top of Iron Forge, find unfinished assets and be able to jump through a hole which would cause you to fall underground all the way to STV. Sort of the wild west of WoW I suppose and it was up to those with enough curiosity to find all the bloopers if you will.

1589	I think SE should implement some sort of counter for "damage taken", so that we can see if cheaters are using the hack or not	Cheaters are like cancer cells. SE is like a doctor that administer the chemotherapy. Done wrongly and you kill the cancer cells AND the good cells. I would say it is very technical challenging to kill all the cancer cells (cheaters) without killing a single good cell (legit player). Either way, someone will get burnt. I had seen games where the ban wave ban cheaters and legit players. It would be fair to give SE Global management team more time to come up with a win-win solutions for us. Some solutions for Battle Tower rewards will be like: * Kill 50 boss to receive 1 summon ticket; kill 100 boss to receive 50 ability ticket; kill 125 boss to receive Heartful egg * Top 500 get Heartful egg; for Rank 501-100,000, those rank ending with 8 also get Heartful egg, e.g.; 508, 518, 528, 1008, 2008 also get Heartful egg. This helps those that just join the game to have access to the rewards too * Removed Heartful Egg from the reward and put Heartful Egg into the chest that we get for every 5 levels. That mean if you kill the 55th Boss, instead of getting 1 ability ticket, you have a chance to get Heartful Egg. Once you got Heartful Egg, you will always get 1 ability ticket. I hope SE do implements one of these solution to help newcomers and experienced players level the playing fields with cheaters. If cheaters can create new accounts and kill 100 boss in 1 day, ban wave is not going to solve anything. What SE can do is to make it less motivating for cheaters to cheat. That is why a lot of store like 7/11 have less than $100 in the store after dark.

1601	after all, he was only following orders.	I realize and understand the desire to get revenge, but it's a nuanced issue. If he merely arrested her, he didn't kill her, so should he be put to death for his actions? What about regular beat cops who were told to arrest "certain people". Where does one draw the line at which one is culpable? Beyond that, unpalatable as it may seem, excluding classes of people from society can have severe consequences. One need to only look as far back as post-invasion Iraq, to observe how many an outcast Ba'athist went on to fight in the insurgency. If your goal is a peaceful, prosperous post-invasion society, you might have to make compromises and forgive those you would rather not forgive.

1611	But but, beef jerky outlet store.	I'd like them to get some nicer apparel stores in that area if it's going to be like a Greenway Station. Right now I almost never stop in there because it's random fast foodish places and odd little shops that aren't much of a draw on their own.
1612	I'm glad there's none of that in today's society!	Very short version: Absinthe became very popular when wine was scarce during The Great Blight. Once the grapevines recovered wealthy French vintners went on a "Reefer Madness" campaign against absinthe and had it declared illegal so that they wouldn't have competition. People got testy when their booze was made illegal to protect someone else's money.

If you want to be cynical about this, it makes sense that virtually every powerful entity on the face of the planet is trying to stop Trump in some way or another. Still doesn't make him anti-establishment. China just happens to be on the right side of the issue here.
1618	One dude in some mobile game asked me where I lived	When were you the most creeped-out by another player's actions in an online game?

1623	Probably because he's not white.	I'm beginning to think trump really hates Obama, for some unknown reason
1624	maybe us and Russia are just trading gay people?	That's funny, because that's exactly what Putin says about America. "Gays are being sent by America to destroy Russia." That Texas Republican has more in common with Putin than he thinks.

1626	they'll lose in columbus	Now we just need Michigan to lose too for some REAL CHAOS.
1627	City people don't ban anything you fucking retard, the government does.	Ok, city people control government, tax the hell out of farmers, food prices skyrocket, everyone cries Armageddon and starves. Or, city people ban all guns because they see no reason to keep them around on the streets. Meanwhile everyone in the country gets f*** because they now can't hunt or protect their families. Or, city people pass huge taxes because, hey, they are all pretty well off. Meanwhile the rural economy gets F*** because now they have to pay huge taxes they simply can't afford in their local economy. Or, city people insist on urban infrastructure projects, leaving rural roads to decay and become dangerous or impossible to navigate. I could go all day
1628	It's half an hour of auteurist brilliance every week	How's Atlanta? Now that it's a few episodes in, how's Atlanta holding up? I enjoyed the first episode I saw that was on YouTube. Is it worth watching the other ones, or does it go down hill?

1633	stick with fiat, it works great.	Inflation is not damaging *if* the new money is used to do *genuine* work for the population. This is the case with bitcoin. It is not inflation free as block by block there are new coins added to the supply. But it is "dilution free" because the unit of account is not diluted by the new money.
1634	Yes.	Isn't that only through bundles?
1635	Bruce Wayne owns the hospitals so at least that money isn't going to batman.	You REALLY can't apply real-world logic to this stuff. Even without taking the batrangs into account, the amount of people he leaves unconscious is super bad for them. Then there's the sheer number of concussions, broken bones, and dislocations. The human body is fragile as all hell, and the amount of permanent neck, spine, and shoulder problems Bat-Villains have must be phenomenal. If we're going to assume real-world injury rules apply, it helps to imagine that half of the criminals in Gotham are stealing so they can afford surgery to fix the problems Batman caused them the last time they met.

1642	It didn't work out in AW because of the maps but it could work out if the maps are botg based Envyus are the best	tihs may be far fetched, but if there is a classic feature to turn on for IW, could be used for competitive? Ive seen one or two maps, and I can say that they dont like like you NEED to wall run to play on the map. i.e terminal remake even though it was a botg map to start with. I think this could be the rejuvenation of Cod esports if the game turns out to have a good time to kill. Hardpoint is in, so thats already a plus. But the 'ghosts' 2 that none of us wanted, this game could be a 'shadow ghosts 2' if you play Iw on classic.

1647	Always appreciate this meme	Here's the thing. You said a "perfect sphere is a spheroid conglomeration." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies spheroid conglomerations, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls perfect spheres spheroid conglomerations. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "spheroid conglomeration family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of spheroids, which includes things from ellipsoids to oblates to prolates. So your reasoning for calling a perfect sphere a spheroid conglomeration is because random people "call the round ones spheroid conglomerations?" Let's get cubes and pyramids in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A perfect sphere is a perfect sphere and a member of the spheroid conglomeration family. But that's not what you said. You said a perfect sphere is a spheroid conglomeration, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the spheroid conglomeration family spheroid conglomerations, which means you'd call ellipsoids, oblates, and other prolates spheroid conglomerations, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?
1648	Unless you know something I don't isn't it Meriadoc Brandybuck?	I totally understand what you mean about it seeming a bit off how the witch king could just be offed like that. Funny thing is Eowyn really doesn't deserve the credit but Meriadoc Took. It was his enchanted sword from the barrows(another scene not in the movie) that made it possible to kill the Witch King. Though they show Merry stabbing the Witch King they really did not make it apparent that he was dying from that wound as opposed to the very showy sword in the face. Merry and his magic sword are the nex level sneakiness that you were looking for.

1652	No there is in forum drama and actual drama, CIG wrote it into a kind of cheesy lore piece that's been written in the style of *HUNDREDS* of huffington post anti-booth babe articles etc.	Wait, there is in-universe controversy over the bikini troops? Directed of course at Drake, and not at CIG, who doesn't exist. It's beautifully meta.

1660	Given that she could justify a crack down on a largely non white underclass if social problems get worse, it probably is her goal.	If your goal is to make France's social problems even worse than they already are, this would be a great way to do it.

1670	I'll be your friend	Yeah, I have a story with Squishy too. It's not a big deal, but I have been good friends with Squishy, playing RL with him and talking on discord, for at least 3-4 months. He just randomly deletes you because the fame gets to him. He usually added me back and apologized, but about a month ago, he kicked me from his discord and blocked me on steam (truly randomly) and he ignored me since. So yeah, Squishy isn't quite yet mature enough to be a respectable Rocket League pro, and that's coming from a 15 year old RL player, but that's just my 2 cents.
1671	Piece of fruit, a granola bar and a peanut butter and honey sandwich.	What do you eat for lunch? I have an idea of what Americans eat for breakfast or for dinner. But what about lunchtime? I guess it depends on some factors like whether you're a student, work at an office etc. Do you have another warm meal, just like for dinner? Or do you just have a PB&amp;J sandwich? Are there some typical lunch meals?

1690	true, but then you have the question of how high your IQ must be to be human.	I never said humans weren't special. I said we're special because of our cognitive sophistication. That's why it's farcical to say a baby born without a brain has human rights.

Someone has apparently watched Elysium. Its literally a prophecy, about the new feudalism that will ensue after the middle-class has evaporated.
1707	Which of the other games have you played through in the past?	First 10 minutes of the game: I was pushing a car. Then I found a mechanic for my car; naturally, this was a big breasted woman in booty shorts and a bikini. Then I hunted Scorpions in the desert wearing a suit. Because I am a Prince and have a sense of decency, I took my jacket off while I did this. This is a Final Fantasy game? It's not terrible but i waited 10 years for this? If the future iterations of the game are like this, probably count me out.

1723	Yeah dude, small businesses were avoiding octroi, excise and all other sorts of taxes by paying in cash.	That is because small businesses so far was mostly avoiding taxes by operating in cash. GST will stop that to a significant extent. So of course their compliance burden will increase, they were non-complaint so far.

They aren't saying "*Tell criminals not to be criminals*", they are saying "*tell Group X not to do [CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR]*"
1725	Yeah but why care about the long-term or overall effects when there's short-term personal gain to be had?	Trumps tax plan is pretty much identical to one being tested in Kansas and failing...

1740	But if everything is privatized, competition will increase quality!	Absolutely nailed it. Net Neutrality's days are numbered, and it's only going to hurt consumers. And privatization of our schools is downright scary. The education of children should not be a profit center. I'm not saying charter schools can't exist, but it could never replace public education to the degree he seems to want it to. The list of things to truly be concerned about is too long to fit into a blurb on reddit. I think r/The_Donald is leaking here, and it's unfortunate.

On one hand they are coming off an embarrassing loss, one of the worst in school history for a football program that has a good winning tradition and will come out with a head of steam. USC typically does well against MW opponents but Utah State is led by an experienced OL and RB group with a dual threat at QB. Question is if Utah State D will be able to matchup against USC skill players. I think Utah State does enough to keep this game close.

1769	No scooters at skate park.	I don't understand why someone would go and cut up someone else's things like that.
1770	You're welcome	With an RBNY win today, NYCFC has earned its HISTORIC first playoff birth in their second season
1771	Obviously, Totsuka.	Its not like u guys dont already know whose gonna winnafter watchin s1
1772	But but what about the supposed guy in the audience that so happened to be there by chance	I bet Hillary couldn't name one person she claims Trump "stiffed."
1773	No Mans Sky (recent PC/PS4 video game) - Overhyped and overpromised, look it up if you wish, quite interesting!	Which is the greatest lie ever sold?
1774	Ryze ult, just drop in the club with my friends like sup.	If you could have ONE ability from ONE champion IRL, what would it be, and why? Definitely Zac passive for me.
1775	Such a rosy disposition!	I think some mods are working for the nwo agenda. I think others are just hall monitors on a power trip. Couple that with a few sock puppets n you got yourself a stew baby!
1776	No they just bomb soldiers fighting IS.	The US never intentionally bombed markets and hospitals.
1777	you clearly missed the 13 points for losing	Am I missing something? 13 wins and 13 draws is 52 points!
1778	Privatisation works	... and a freeway can carry even more. Once there is a competitive market for transport that is very cheap to run, algorithms will be able to match desired routes and combine commuter trips. There will still be mass transit, but the private market will do a far superior and cheaper job than the government will possibly be able to do (bureaucracy/etc). Why is it that the government doesn't operate domestic airlines?
1779	Maybe then he can see over 24 fps	Could you do that thing where they attach a robot eye and wire it to your brain?
1780	If only his brother hadn't written something...	Willett must have out up one of the worst Ryder Cup performances ever
1781	first thing that pops into my head upon reading this... they don't want the competition.	Nearly One Out Of Three Trump Voters In SC Would Ban Gays From Entering The U.S.
1782	2016: Rise of the Greatest Fro on (grassy) Turf	Chip Kelly says Colin Kaepernick will start at quarterback for #49ers this week
1783	Didn't hear Allahu Akbar enough times, it's obviously fake.	Yemeni forces destroy Emirati vessel
1784	So impressive if glaz is a bot	How to out sniper a Glaz on Plane
1785	If only minorities could be as enlightened as white college kids...	Unfortunately, non-whites are slaves to the establishment. They could vote third party and for issues that would change their lives, but their Democrat slave masters have them by the chain. The Democratic party remembers minorities every 4 years for election time, only so they can vote for corporate interest. I pity them.
1786	Who?	You want to be Warren Buffet.
1787	we already got rats/cook off for that	a sex dungeon heist?
1788	God	The God of Sarcasm
1789	Even if there was blood or bullet holes on the walls you could use r_cleardecals to remove it.	I somehow convinced 13 people to graffiti a wall and not ruin it with blood.
1790	Must your iBand.	I see dreams in vivid color, extremely realistically, and I can choose exactly what I dream about by thinking of it as I lay. I never forget dreams, but always think they're real regardless of how realistic. Why?
1791	Quick warning - Clean and Clear usually doses their stuff up with a whole bunch of alchohol which can dry you out pretty bad	My back acne was/is never severe as yours, but salicylic acid always works for me. Lots of people recommend Stridex pads, but if you don't have those where you're from Oxy and Clean and Clear make similar products. Also all these brands are pretty cheap! I would recommend starting out with 0.5 or 1.0% first, just to see if the product works for you (personally my skin got dry and itchy before it started clearing up)
1792	You ok dood?	guess i'm going to arizona next summer
1793	Hey i got dis obamuh fone u dont like free stuffz?	Californians are like "Bernie gibs me freee stuffs."
1794	No man its all just latent talent Koreans are just naturally better, its not like they put in insane hours	It's been clear for the past several years that Korea is the region that breeds the most workaholics. Virtually every S-tier Korean player in history has been known to possess an incredible work ethic. Undoubtedly, being surrounded by such players who constantly practice will drive others to do the same. I recall during the era of the Samsung sister teams in which Heart was rumored to have practiced 18 hours daily - just to keep up with Mata.
1795	but your eyes cant see that many frames	FPS. People thinking 60 FPS isn't necessary in new gen games and that 30 is enough make me mad.
1796	I'd love to hear your take on public education and the infrastructure you apparently never use.	Taxation is theft. And you should feel bad.
1797	Yeah i'm pretty sure they wrote the script knowing it would suck	They already knew it was bad
1798	That certainly is a possibility but doesn't fit in with the whole, "rougher friends" narrative	I read somewhere that heating up the bottom of a spoon and applying it to a big bite will kill the proteins in the big bite and make it stop itching. I tried it once and looked like a junkie for a solid second and a half. I wouldn't worry about it.
1799	C9 azir	Which skin should I buy gravelord or SKT t1? I was thinking of buying grave lord azir, but I heard that the basic attack animation isn't as smooth. Anyways which is the best 1?
1800	Good to know that there aren't murders, rapes, assaults, or thefts in Lake Louise.	Lake Louise leads per-capita marijuana possession incidents across Canada
1801	He is clearly Mace Windu's illegitimate son	The Ice Cream Machine guy is missing.
1802	Battered Wife Syndrome.	And the person still supports Trump.
1803	And the jobs created will be a wide variety or low, middle, and high skilled jobs which will easily make up the difference.	I hate that fucking argument. What jobs will it hurt? We can't start millions of new jobs creating green energy and having to build that infrastructure? And who needs a job when you're dead.
1804	Was the bug not having Sombra in game	Bug fixes.
1805	Because every woman's name is Hillary Clinton.	"Nobody respects women more than me."
1806	Sometimes the mixtape is so fire that everyone needs to hear it	Muting doesn't prevent you from losing because of teammates who are more interested in playing you their mixtape and you can't kick someone if they queue with a friend.
1807	yea you are definitely not very intelligent.	I like QTpie's youtube videos, but I find that a slippery slope that he is able to just skype a Rioter and get the problem fixed. If it happened to me it would take a month minimum to reach someone via e-mail.
1808	Nice seeing fellow STALKERs playing BF1	That moment when the servers are down
1809	but nwdekay knows nothing about cs and just tries to be a second thorin even though everything he reports becomes true	nwdekay answered me on twitter after i've asked him about it and he said that the swap was discussed but dignitas are happy with what they have going right now.
1810	Because who would want to protect the value of the largest investment of their life right?	First world problems.
1811	i'm a mod for the elohim subreddit.	Dear Subreddit Owners/Mods
1812	Look at this asshole doesnt even give out the king size.	I've always wanted to be "that house" on Halloween.
1813	How dare you be thankful for other peoples appreciation.	Well, it's not that it's required. I think people are downvoting you because you attempt to speak for all medics when you say "**we** don't really care." It's fine that you don't care, but just speak for yourself. Personally, I'll revive people whether they say thanks or not. However, it does bring a smile to my face when the person goes out of their way to say "thank you" in chat after I risked my life to revive them. As such, I always get to cover after a revive, and immediately say thank you to any other medics in kind.
1814	I dunno, seven seas was my JAM for a long long time	I have 200mL of various bombies juices and none of them taste good?!? Big fan of nana cream so during a few of their sales, I stocked up and a bunch of their juices. All 3mg nic. They've been sitting in a drawer for 3 months. So far I've tried agent P, seven seas and product x and none of them taste good. Is it the general consensus that name cream is the only good flavor?!?
1815	You get an upvote for your boldness	I'm pretty sure the physical layer is 1 ... oh fuck got it. While I could just delete the comment I will allow my shame to stand.
1816	The M/42-57 is going to be added to the Swedish tech tree in 9.17	Skoda T40 and the Strv m/42blahblahblah (available for a limited time only in the premium shop) are solid tier 6s. The Type 64 is also an option if you like tier 6 stronghold and the SU-100Y is great in pubs if you like TDs. As for tier 8s the T34, FCM 50T, Super Pershing, IS-6, CDC, and T-34-3 are all great tanks depending on what playstyle you like. The M 41 90mm, Skorpion G, and Panzer Mutz are also fantastic if you can get a hold of them when they're on sale again.
1817	there is a way on YouTube to select what type of ads you get, I found it once but don't remember how	No. If they are depending on ads that either a) give me malware or b) are LONGER than the thing I want to watch in the first place, they deserve to fail. Be more picky about the ads you serve and maybe people won't mind them.
1818	I	M
1819	Well that answers it!	Check out my edit above.
1820	My friend has a dog that starts howling if she makes howling sounds herself.	German shepherd howling with wolves from Zootopia
1821	Dak	Standard Andy Dalton v Bills or Dak Prescott v Ravens
1822	Hahaha, hay, sana magkaroon talaga satin na official.	Pixel! There's always a way to get one.
1823	And they suddenly receive a phd in nutrition	Seriously tho... how many people have experienced this?
1824	Ever see a lux Q come at you in slow motion, I always do and stil lget hit by it.	What's the ability that getting hit by makes you feel the worst? For me it has got to be Soraka Q. Getting hit by it or seeing an ally get hit by it pisses me off so much. Feels so fucking awful to get hit by.
1825	Sparky has literally never been stronger than it is right now	SuperCell is killing Sparky All the new cards hurt Sparky. Mega Minion can snipe a sparky and doesn't have much of a hard counter. Graveyard Spell absolutely destroys Sparky surrounding it in a way that the first shot is easily wasted and also so wizard cant hit all of them. Ice Yeti is a cheap sacrifice that slows down the sparky charge allowing troops to kill sparky without a proper surround before sparky can even charge back up Inferno Dragon is a flying unit. A sparky decks biggest weakness is air. This card will melt your sparky and then turn around to melt your Giant Balance update hurt Sparky Lightning deals massive damage to Sparky and resets charge Log if timed correctly can reset Sparky Even previous changes are hurting Sparky The zap buff has increased use of Rocket and Freeze. While it is true that this is what fair gameplay is, Sparky players should have some sort of chance to win rather than having to wait for the opponent to foolishly use that spell Please fix this SuperCell. Sparky is one of those cards that promote that offensive strategy that you wanted sometime back in March and Sparky honestly needs some sort of buff to survive this rocky meta. I'm aware that some cards like Skarmy and Baby Dragon just don't have a place in the meta but the last time a #legendary was underpowered (The Log) you gave it a buff so why can't Sparky get a buff now? Sparky is barely bordering on legendary but after the release of these new cards, Sparky players will have an even tougher time to deal with the pool of cards pitted against them and this might eventually facilitate the death of Sparky altogether.
1826	Pretty egotistical to imply we'd even warrant a whole dot.	If we were to graph the time we've lived, the space we've taken up, and the impact we've had, all in relation to the entire universe and all time, we would barely register as a dot on that graph.
1827	No.	Can I have a link to thread please?
1828	"many"= like 5	These haven't been cool for many years
1829	Well, this is still Reddit, so I'm not really sure why that's unbelievable to you.	Is it just me or is it fucking unbelievable that there are Trump apologists on this sub?
1830	He finds him annoying because of the helmet gimmick, how he didn't leave him alone at Ultra and on Twitter judging by some tweets.	Seriously trying to understand what Deadmau5 has against Marshmello
1831	*shawarma law	404 No suitable titles were found.
1832	We've had SOOOOOOOO many.	i'm so fed up with futuristic shooters already
1833	That's just the logical next step	...why is he sleeping on a cake?
1834	How the fuck is Russia banning porn sites important	Probably with actual important news? Why is this important
1835	Be aware - contains spoilers for many animes.	A bag of Crossover wallpapers
1836	Any personal favourites you would like to recommend?	Buy a non-mac laptop, replace hdd with ssd, install Linux and boom, a laptop better than a Mac! Seriously though, you could get i7 7th gen,8gb ram, 15.6 inch 1080p screen, 256 gb ssd, 940mx 4gb GPU,1tb external hard drive for around 80-85k.
1837	Good god.. You all.. "Man, you don't know nothing about no war"	Huh, yeah what is it good for
1838	That's why you listen to shit with no lyrics or if you, be sure it's a band you don't really like a lot.	Listening to music sometimes works, and sometimes you pay too much attention to the lyric. Yesterday was my "worst" moment, I did the activities I had for my college and washed the dishes just because I was stuck in such a boring quest on World of Wacraft that I decided to procrastinate my procrastination.
1839	theyd build it on the other side of course because they love the god emporer that much	Once all the Mexicans are deported, there will be nobody left to build the fucking thing though.
1840	yup	I didn't exactly get to watch, will you have that whole OT up?
1841	*That* explains why my copy of Windows sucks so bad -- it's all the damned Russians' fault!	Microsoft Corp said on that a hacking group linked to the Russian government and U.S. political hacks was behind recent cyber attacks that exploited a newly discovered Windows security flaw. A patch to protect Windows against the newly discovered threat will be released on Nov. 8, Election Day.
1842	When is it going to fully roll out?	1CMBG commander gave us a talk about that. The army's gonna go American style and start filling up the empty velcro on the new combats. Right sleeve is going to be Div and Bde patch. Left sleeve is the flag with tabs underneath. Tabs like "airborne", "recce", "mountain", "sniper". He's gonna try and push for the PPCLI tabs as well but I can see most of the battalions just throwing it on anyways.
1843	True, it's just that we hear this rhetoric so often, that it has become dull now that it would actually be an important point to make.	Paying an high price just to save face is pretty deplorable though, and that's what's happening in this case.
1844	"I'll take you to the hospital" Like wtf does that even mean?	Yeah, the way he just nonchalantly leans against his wing and crosses his legs and arms would have had me punching the teeth down his throat. Fucking dickhead trying to talk it down like its no big deal.
1845	They did give rough release dates of 2014 and 2015, and announce delays from those.	It was "2016" for SQ 42. They never gave a solid date. Now looks like it'll be 2H 2017.
1846	Sometimes I can't just hear the alarm even if snoozes for an hour.	LPT for those college students who can't wake up USE SLEEP AS ANDROID! I use the CAPTCHA that requires me to tap my phone to an NFC tag to disable the alarm. When I was setting it up and trying to use the NFC tag in my wallet, it ended up being activated by my school ID. If your schools ID has the functionality to tap and open doors like mine does, it may also contain an NFC chip. There's also tons of other awesome features as well. Almost made me want to buy a Philips Hue light bulb so I could have a light on my bed that turned on with my alarm but it wouldn't work on the dorm internet. Seriously went from waking up ten minutes before class started to an hour before. It's helped so much.
1847	Siyempre, para hindi maabala yung mga taong wala namang pakialam sa layunin mo.	Kelangan ba ng permit para lasapin ang demokrasya?
1848	That's like saying the average american meal is biscuits and gravy, erry night.	I'd have gone for neeps &amp; tatties with a nip of whiskey and a can of tennants
1849	theyre always the first to push the bullshit like the REC controls the sec or we pay off refs.	They do like to whine, don't they? Did you notice that when the LSU-Florida game was postponed, the amount of bitching coming from LSU fans was about 20 times the amount that came from Florida fans.
1850	Well for the record blackbeards massive helmet is part of his hitbox so.....	And yet Blackbeards beard is not part of his head hitbox. DOUBLE STANDARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1851	Right, this is exactly why i commented that :(	I don't want to be a pessimist, but I wouldn't be 100% certain that the new expansion will break the shaman meta. Even if all new shaman cards are garbage, mid shaman has proven itself to be a very tough deck to counter. Worst case scenario we have to wait for the rotation 2017.
1852	Network show writers are pushing the Marxist "biological sex" is just a social construct bullshit and people are tuning out for alternate entertainment free of the ideological zealotry and propaganda.	TV shows are getting smacked by big viewership drops
1853	I would assume that these regions aren't talking about armed secession, but forcing a referendum similar to the Scottish independence vote that would pressure the government to respect the will of the voters.	We wouldn't need Russia to invade California to start WW3; the Civil War that would result from a Californian secession would likely accomplish that all on it's own.
1854	No they made an AI which people fucked with	but, they made a racist AI!.
1855	lol i thought he said isis leaders not all of isis i mean bin laden got killed in a sneak attacked and it worked if the media announced where binladen was and when they would attack him pretty sure he would have left where he was hiding and dissapear, i mean your comment makes sense if he meant to sneak attack all of isis at once but i can understand sneak attack to take out targeted leaders of isis etc..	He said his plan to defeat ISIS was a sneak attack.
1856	GOOD point	Yeah, but once you get it to space the weight goes down and the cost evens out.
1857	Yes	BS call. what's he supposed to do, let him throw it?
1858	The best dinguses are at the bottom.	Still upvoted. I upvoted all of you. Dingus me all you want.
1859	The best defense is the defense that gives up the fewest points and does what needs to be done to secure the win.	I know right. In a pass happy league, the broncos are first. The best pass defense is the best defense in the league. Patriots and giants are no where close.
1860	Never even heard of it, and PS2 is the newest system I play.	This day 10 years ago, one of the greatest PS2 games was released...
1861	Yeah but I'm different!	pot meet kettle
1862	This will be adjusted to Trump + 15 and drop HRC to a 2% chance of winning.	Clinton up 1 in Ohio
1863	yeah i can see how such stable discourse, stability, and a higher quality of life we have right now	Except now we have avenues of stable discourse, stability, and a higher quality of life than otherwise possible
1864	Fast Eddie.	What's he changing his name to this year?
1865	I figured, thank you.	terrible fake
1866	Yes, Memrise is good too!	I think Memrise are trying to record dying languages
1867	I know, I was saying just open them up, not change a load of aero regs as well.	No more tokens next year so they did open up the engine rules.
1868	Still barely tier-3 hero.	Butcher can hit for well over 700 damage late game. Adding that onto Hamstring makes it a huge, instant AoE nuke comparable to Flamestrike damage, with a 4 second or 3 second cooldown if talented. Furnace Blast at level 20 would total about 1800 damage, which is almost half the HP of most squishies. By itself.
1869	oops, you dropped this:	This is why the legal voting age is 18. Kids are extremely gullible and easily manipulated. Personally, I'm voting for trump because he's going to lower taxes, and make the US a world power, and end poverty, and end world hunger, and probably make me a millionaire during his first year in office.
1870	Proportions seem right to me... you'll never hear me complain about getting too much food at a restaurant	My wife and I frequently split meals at restaurants, especially in America where the portions seem to be made for elephant-sized creatures.
1871	D'ya have access to an actual brake, or do you just believe in an aggressive use of pliers?	I combined my hobby and engineering degree to set up vertical monitor
1872	Tumblr is full of them, young fat women with awesome willpower but chose to remain fat because it would be unfair to the rest of us.	One of the major problems facing scientific studies of weight loss techniques is non-compliance. Changing your lifestyle is hard and a certain portion of your participants are going to give up, corrupting your data. Well, at 40 lbs down and 65 more to go I said to myself, "I've proven that I can stick to a diet plan and I intend to lose more weight anyway. Let's sign up for a study. For Science!" But wait! Science doesn't want me. I used a study finder to search for things going on in my area and after filtering out the bariatric surgeries (no thanks) all of the studies have three conflicting requirements: a BMI of 30 to 40, a willingness to restrict caloric intake, and no significant weight loss or gain in the last 6 months. So you need to be overweight, capable of sticking to a reasonable diet, but simply have chosen not to. Science, where are you finding these slightly chubby unicorns?
1873	a post	The fuck did I just read?
1874	You dropped this	For freaking real!... I love this post. Did you sit on this for months waiting to unveil it or did it just come to you recently? Have my up vote sir!
1875	LOL	YG &amp; Nipsey Hussle - FDT (Fuck Donald Trump)
1876	Andrews, you are an idiot...	Official Game Day Thread: New England Patriots (3-1) @ Cleveland Browns (0-4) | Kickoff 1:00 PM ET, October 9, 2016 | FirstEnergy Stadium, Cleveland, OH

1878	Not UK politics	Trump beats Clinton to take White House - BBC News
1879	Look at today's energy sector if you are talking about this in terms of the stock market.	What will GOP win mean for TSLA? I don't want to start a political thread, but I am actually nervous a GOP sweep will hurt the stock and company badly (deregulation, climate change, and tax credits positions). Am I wrong? I am strongly considering selling my shares (I am long) at a loss...
1880	I can't tell if you're seriously upset about Pandaren or not.	Shows that it was a worth while time investment to add them.
1881	cool, I'm glad better players are also having some positive experiences with him!	Im rank 12 and play mainly sirius and im having a great time at my tier in both 2v2 and 3v3 (tho i feel like hes stronger in 2v2). He has great burst damage with charged m1 and can easily do m1 trades vs all characters if you make sure to fight during weaken. Great CC with petrify and slows with R and ex-m1. Good mobility and decent healing output. Its easy to punish people out of position with his ulti once their mobility spell is down. I do think he could use a small buff to get to Pearl and polomas level tho (or they a nerf to get to his).
1882	Mic drop	Take this shit back to Facebook
1883	she is...and the White House is their most valuable business asset for the next 4-8 years!	I thought Ivanka was going to be the CEO of the Trump Organization.
1884	Expensive	how's 'Best Kratom' Beginner's Pack ?
1885	Shouldn't you be in bed, Dad?	Well, that's debatable! Sorry. Bad joke. I'll leave now.
1886	Come on, don't ruin his point with facts!	Mussolini and Erdogan yes, but Hitler was never elected. His party rose in popluarity, but he never reached a majority enough to form a government. Instead, he was put into office by a president that thought he could controlle him and Hitler was able, due to intimidation and the usage of followers of him in the police-froce to stage a coup etat (by preventing the communist parties to come to parliament during the Enabling Act and the other's he used manipulation and threatening so that even with a minority he was able to take over the power)
1887	I would like to know if I'm on track to do a world conquest with Champa.	Can I pull off a WC?
1888	Yep De Gea is much better	Aguero has been woeful apart from that smashing in the champions league qualifier and his recent goals. Silva ehh decent this season, if you are going to use neuer why not use de gea as well. Muller has been horrible since the euro, Ozil is world class but not top ten, and iniesta is currently injured... de bruyne is having a blinding season however.
1889	I think it was a snapchat filter	Obama got some big ass goofy teeth in that last photo
1890	#HE'S THE B I R D	Jonimorphs
1891	this is why we need capitalism, people need incentives to make progress	TIL Michael Faraday, one of the foremost experimenters of his time, declined a knighthood, believing that it was against the word of the Bible to pursue worldly reward. He stated that he preferred to remain "plain Mr. Faraday to the end."
1892	How two wrongs make good?	Like the meetings in China related to CPEC where the PM was escorted by one CM and the son of that CM? Kind of like that?
1893	Don't you know, Jews run the economy?	worked in finance = not anti-semitic how?
1894	But it satisfies my dogma about how all private enterprise is superior to evil public enterprise.	Yep people love to toute privatization of the Government, but fail to realize how much of the government already IS privatized and a lot of "government spending waste" is in part thanks to this privatization. Cafeteria services, waste and food contracts, security, contracts, hell a huge chunk of defense spending is pouring right into contracts with different private providers for everything from research and construction, to grounds keeping. If we actually tried to separate out all the stuff we spend on private companies today out of public budgets, which itself is nearly impossible with how things are budgeted, I think peoples eyes would bug out at how privatized our government actually IS and just who is getting rich off of it being that way.
1895	Jesus this series is 9 episodes shorter than RE, but feels eternally longer	Zelda The Wand of Gamelon: Shrine of Gamelon - PART 21 - Game Grumps
1896	Same stuff the Emperor's new clothes are made of...	Kid Asks Donald Trump 'What Will The Wall Be Made Of ' at Virginia Rally
1897	I bet that after this picture was taken the smile vanished, the eyes widened, the crease above her nose deepened, and she said something callous and bizarre.	Aileen Wournos with her 69 year old husband at the time - Lewis Fell - looking genuinely happy
1898	Arma 3 for best game in general, you should emulate Shadow of the Colossus.	Best Pc Games ever? Sup everyone I'm about to build my pc and I need to buy a couple games for it. I was wondering what games would you guys recommend to start out with?

1902	Vel's easier to pick up and is more consistent.	Xerath or Vel'koz Hey, I'm interested in expanding my mid champion pool and was thinking of a long range champ. I usually go lb or annie. I know both xerath and vel'koz are kind long range poke/burst mids. What are your thoughts on who is better and why is it that you would argue for them? Thanks!
1903	Welp, unless Rob starts to have facecam regularly and like when he's on Roundtable, I'm gonna be thinking Jack Black's face from now on, when i hear him...	Rob is doing the nug challenge right the fuck now! With a webcam!
1904	But as we all know, biology don't real...	Women are also disadvantaged genetically for video games. One example: reaction times.
1905	We call it underwear, or refer to it more specifically as boxers, briefs, panties (though I personally hate that word), etc.	'Pants' Given that American English split from English-English when you lot started buggering off on rather big boats, I don't get how 'pants' morphed from the original English meaning into 'Any kind of trouser except for jeans' 'Pants' here is to refer to your undies - If you use 'pants' to mean trousers instead of 'trousers', what in the name of arse do you call your undercrackers? These are the questions that keep me up at night. Well, that and the Shouty Owl, but mainly the questions.
1906	We gotta fight the Russian propaganda with our own propaganda, that will make the public trust us	The European Parliament called on the EU and its states to do more to counter Russian "disinformation and propaganda warfare" on Wednesday, drawing an angry response from President Vladimir Putin
1907	But Trump is filling his Cabinet posts with billionaires, what could possibly go wrong?	I only used 4 years because OP made reference to it. Nothing to do with the president-elect. But economies go through normal cycles. I'm also of the opinion that the economy will just go from bubble to bubble for the foreseeable future.
1908	you forgot	If any player who has left China deserves a shot on a Korean team, its Dade. He may not be a world champion, but his greatness is evidenced by his ability to perform at an MVP calibre on a team where he is not the ultimate shotcaller (MVP Ozone) and his ability to carry a team to All-World levels and play at an MVP level himself. The man was - at one time - humanity's best answer to the being that is Faker. With all hes accomplished, doubting him would be difficult. Just look at his return to form from his abysmal World's performance in 2013.
1909	I can only remember like two popes that weren't useless.	That is just because you are bad at history that you think this is true.
1910	Crafted by He who has no name.	Yeah well C3PO was crafted by the force incarnate.
1911	Very compelling post.	I'm not a hunter because I feel it's immoral to kill animals when you don't have to but I think if he wants to hunt that's ok since it's his choice and it's legal but he didn't have to call up the press and send them a photo of him with a dead deer he just killed given there's alot of people in VT that share my views.
1912	I love the app, and don't see why was kill.	RIP Alien Blue I don't look forward to the day when I update my phone or have to reset it
1913	You mean a neocon corporatist third way shill... If you didn't steal the primary from Bernie by not voting for him, he would've won the general where I'm sure there would've been a bunch more far-left voters.	This is just the most awful time to be a moderate Democrat you guys, I wanna put that out there.
1914	It means OP doesn't think butthurt is an injury	? What does this mean
1915	Not when you keep your condoms in your wallet/purse.	Aren't those all the samething?
1916	Yep, late 2013 model here, use it for video editing and 3D modeling.	Do you still use a Mac Pro? If not, what did you replace it with?
1917	Ahh my bad, should have thought of that -_-	in EU it already ended. There is players still trying to get it.
1918	wow so relevant	AH HA
1919	Well you could just use the Lex P. and get all those things....	Give an option for a normal (like non-sniper) zoom. Remove weapon sway on snipers. Boom, snipers are suddenly a tiny bit more viable. A tiny bit.
1920	Valid point, but committee has made one thing clear: Alabama-OSU is their preferred championship.	I guess you can't say I am not biased, but I think OSU would be #4 and Washington #3 because of conference championship.
1921	He didn't crash, the sun sabotaged his car.	yeap. alll these street circuits are just so darn boring. 90 degree turns everywhere. the only interesting bit at baku is the uphill turns where hamilton crashed it in qualy lol
1922	Finding (and getting) a job.	What are you struggling with right now?
1923	Got it, I'm adding you now.	im ready whenever you are
1924	Asked elsewhere with no results : do you think we can collect incubators and use them whenever we like, or will they expire with the event?	Free Incubator Question So I'm going out tonight and expect to be out until midnight (EST). Do you think I will recieve a free incubator at midnight, and if not will I still be able to get one on christmas if I already had my first stop of the day before the event starts?
1925	Yeah, people having hobbies, So stupid!	Your boyfriend sounds like a loser. Spending hours a day playing videogames and spending ages watching videos too. Couldn't imagine tolerating that sort of shit in a relationship.
1926	*Gets out the popcorn* youhavenopowerhere.gif	If a man had said something like "lmao I know, women are fucking whores", this sub would be going crazy.
1927	On experimental or stable?	dayz crashes when exiting really annoying but the game crashes everytime I exit (reference memory) using windows 10
1928	sounds like one of those screaming goats lol	The bolt-on supercharger for the HSV-GTR is quite possibly the loudest I've ever heard in a Forza game.
1929	What do you expect, they have a huge spike through them?	Jesus...Those hands...
1930	okay, so they'd go for Bernie in the general	Ohio was the open primary stops trump vote Kasich state. you are remiss to forget that. many I know wanted to vote bernie but felt they were doing a civic duty tryimg to lock trump out of the nomination
1931	Yes.	Should felons have the right to keep and bear arms, per the 2nd amendment?
1932	The only real way for that kind of turn around is to sell something that you already have	I need to make 100 dollars in 1-2 days
1933	Anyone else think of a country to check out only to come to the realization that they suck at geography?	Listen to live radio all over the world by navigating an interactive globe
1934	Brown people have guns.	what part of this is a war crime?
1935	Careful what you wish for.	As awesome as it would be if it turns out that this is all true and appropriate measures are taken to avert the looming darkest timeline horrors. It would be even sweeter to finally be able to call McConnell a *literal* traitor to the United States of America.
1936	It's a good thing Trump released his tax returns.	So he's getting an unknown amount of Russian funding (probably large amount since US banks won't lend to him) and he's currently underwater while leveraged, so he can't divest. The IRS would have more info though, right?
1937	You kidding?I'm not getting shot defending a hypothetical clown	Hm. Did you tell him that's illegal?
1938	But it's still on it's way regardless	I don't know.
1939	They re-ran that particular episode a few times during the campaign to keep production costs down.	Did this nigga really say 'beginning of the end'?
1940	Redbone	Riot
1941	Too logical man, this is Reddit	Why not treat each of Trump's actions independently of each other?
1942	New asparagus melee weapon confirmed	Newton's Cookbook. This is literally all I can think of.
1943	But how else will they display dominance?	Sure, completely overreact to the smallest slights and you will surely have a stellar social life.
1944	Fucking opportunistic immigrants.	Sponsor me?
1945	A bit late to this thread but I thought this way until I got to A Level and Edexcel expected you to know that sin x + y ^ 9 meant sin(x+y)^9 or whatever (granted it was often obvious by context which was more likely but I'd still have appreciated them being specific)	Why do those Facebook things never involve brackets? I was always taught to basically ignore the order of operations because questions would always be presented appropriately bracketed.
1946	Can confirm lost my mind.	Right-Wingers Lose Their Minds Over App That Replaces Photos Of Their Messiah Donald Trump With Kittens
1947	I still feel bad for that porn actress that didn't know what a Bob-it was.	1. Post in r/games 2. Bop It
1948	I guess some people can't handle their snow leopards.	I want to vomit. I deserve it for my stupid curiosity. So disgusting
1949	Man up and stop being so uptight.	that's called sexual assault my guy. good idea to distance yourself from her.
1950	Yes, I want my FLIR scopes.	DICE. PLS!!!
1951	Nah we all know Jae shouldn't have shot that.	What a play by IT and Jae!!
1952	*Reeeeeally* really?	Very really
1953	Yep, even though the election is over, we're all still getting paid by Hillary cause the funding hasn't ran out just yet	I'm convinced this sub is 75% paid shills and 24% delusional psychos with 1% of people being rational people.
1954	if the flash series is to go by, then he was injured by a normal punch of a normal goon.	What could hit the fastest man alive is what I want to know.
1955	[Humor] this isn't funny	I need deck help...
1956	Guess I should've used	What thing that people love is basically just a rip-off?
1957	Seriously ?	Serious
1958	You'd think someone would have foreseen this and handed out post ops instructions	We need a sticky thread for this, thrush , and "my tooth hurts to bite after a filling"
1959	You must have never seen JaMarcus Russell play then.	Heaviest man to ever throw a touchdown pass.
1960	Not op, but I've had "all natural dreadlocks" before.	How bad? 80s hair metal bad, or 50s Beatles bad?
1961	Me too, thanks	I'm fucking retarded, I thought the red circle around the pad was what we were looking at because red circles.
1962	on 9th banks and atms were closed	I think its a fairy balanced factual page with links to real reports, *where exactly* are you seeing "lots of misinfo and bias" ? In the sentence you quote "Since 9th Nov" is not that inaccurate, people were lining up on the 8th itself in many places..
1963	Easy bet there is no 13th month	willing to bet anyone money that fallout 5 releases 11.13.2018 any takers?
1964	The second row from their left side.	Find the main characters
1965	"But these guys are nicer terrorists!"	Such is the middle East. It's definitely a case of "the devil you know".
1966	The NFL doesn't do rankings, why should CFB?	Opinion: If you have 0 wins, you shouldn't be ranked. Yes, this would remove the concept of preseason rankings. I think they're worse than meaningless, they're detrimental to the game by giving weight to guesswork. But let's say we want to keep preseason rankings because *man* it's a long offseason. If you lose in week one, in week two you should be unranked. Forget "quality losses" in week one, we have no idea if the team that beat you is any good yet. We'll know (or act like we know) further down the line after more games are played. So, in my opinion, ND, OU, USC, LSU, (and every other team with 0 wins) should be unranked in week 2. We should be rewarding teams that win instead of rewarding teams that lose to opponents we assume to be good. If ND, OU, USC, and LSU win games in the coming weeks, we should rank them then. But not if you're 0-1. (or 0-antyhing)
1967	"art"	Why does this exist?
1968	if it were open house it would be way too crazy.	Only available to PSL holders unfortunately. It SHOULD be open house, but unfortunately F1 doesn't really care about your average fan. I'm also looking for a pass to the pit walk.
1969	But can anyone *prove* that this is harmful, especially when you aren't allowed to know what chemicals are used, because if not then I still have a right to do business!	A Russian river now runs blood-red after potential contamination from mining operations.
1970	yes, old format was more like a community stream, where you could hang out with the devs, this format is more imformation, more scripted but less fun, way too professional, not causal enough	I agree to disagree For me personally this feels like a live "10 for the devs" than RtV I liked the old way, where the people joined (more or less) random and talked about stuff, instead of this format I don't dislike the information or anything, just the Style / Format of the new RtV :&lt;
1971	Sorry PVT Johnson, here's your taxi to the front gate, 20 bucks, and civilian clothes.	I used to get calls from parents as a basic training commander. It was usually "I haven't heard from my son, is he ded?". I'd respond with the "we give them time during the week to make phone calls, but we don't tell them who to call. I'm sorry they aren't calling you. No, I'm not going to do anything about it, we're busy with training and army stuff." One of my favorites was from the mother of PVT Johnson. He was one of my serial AWOL guys, always returning and leaving before I could get any UCMJ paperwork to stick. And no, having an NCO driving to charleston twice a day to get him in pre-trial confinement wasn't going to happen. Anyway, his mother called and introduced herself as Johnson's mom. I started with, "Yes, we are separating him, and no there's nothing you can tell me to make that different." (except nicer, probably) Her response: "Oh, I know. Just please tell him his girlfriend is pregnant, its not his, and he can't live at home when he gets back."
1972	Kith...and then bite hith ear off.	Now kith.
1973	Or maybe regi could give more money?	A solution to the Prize Pool issues I know this has been a hot button topic. I just wanted to post some possible solutions to the prize pool being so low. 1. DOTA approach: Sell items that help contribute to increasing the prize pool. Can do a simple percentage such as 1% of sales or something like that go towards the prize pool. That way Riot gets their money, and the prize pool gets increased. 2. Merchandising approach: Riot allows merchants to go through their website. This includes team merch. Cut it into percentages. A certain percent goes to Riot for hosting, a certain percent goes to the team, and a minimal percent goes to prize pool. 3. Donation/Crowdfunding approach: The least optimal approach, but ask for donations/crowdfunds to go towards the prize pool and have the community crowdfund for a bigger prize pool. Just a few ideas I had. Feel free to add to either approach, or add an approach of your own.
1974	But, it's so much easier to say than So-duh!	Ha, pop. Silliest name ever.
1975	No, dont you get it, Dortmund only bought Auba so they could get that sweet Gabonese market	no... I honestly don't know what you mean.
1976	Ohhhhhh I'm sooooo sorry	Sorry. I am just kinda sick of jokes about marriage sucking or women being somehow shitty. Stereotype jokes are generally less funny than jokes about personality flaws to me.
1977	Ford keeps track of like everything in the park, plus MiB seems to be an acquaintance so maybe he keeps extra tabs on him.	Hmmm... wonder how Ford knew MiB was going to stop at that particular bar...?
1978	For real, it's cheaper to pull out, and I'm pro at this shit by now	Condoms.
1979	I guess he forgot the	Honesty should only be the policy if they are also honest with you. If they are crazy religious fanatics with control of your bank account, you lie.
1980	That doesn't sound familiar at all.....	They do. But bad pitching.
1981	lol	lol
1982	Yeah but he made quips and didn't know the word "children".	Let's do a check list of what movie Ultron did: He self activated himself, he learnt everything about the human race in less then a minute, he ripped Jarvis apart, built himself a body, hacked the Iron legion, hacked Avengers Tower and stole a bunch of their data, escaped with Loki's sceptre, injured Rhodey, wrecked Avengers tower, broke himself into a Hydra base, formed a schism between the team, manipulated Pietro and Wanda to join forces with him, killed Baron Von Strucker, broke into numerous labs across the globe upgrading himself and killing anyone who got in his way, built an army, was untraceable to the Avengers, nearly hacked the nuclear codes (which is super hard to do), de-powered a ship yard, transferred millions of dollars, sliced off Klaw's arm, out smarted Thor/pointed out that Captain America is a terrible person/out-quipped Tony Stark (twice), got away with the Vibranium, kicked the crap out Iron Man, distracted Iron Man from the main plan of action, painted the Avengers (especially Hulk) in a bad image in South Africa, broke into Dr Cho's lab, found out that the sceptre had an infinity gem in it, built the Vision, knew when the Quinjet showed up, injured Dr Cho, killed her entire staff, went one-for-one with Captain America to the point that he over powered him (Hawkeye: "You're no match for him Cap"), flunk Cap's shield like it was nothing, pulled a part of the road out of the ground, caused a huge car crash, took on 5 Avengers (Captain America, Black Widow, Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch and Hawkeye) in South Korea, killed a train driver, destroyed a chunk of the city by derailing a train, kidnapped Black Widow, was so powerful and unkillable Thor had to bring the Vision to life to defeat him (Thor: "The Avengers can not defeat Ultron"), was responsible for a being capable of lifting up Thor's hammer, ripped himself apart, built a meteor machine that took Sokovia out of the ground, killed 177 citizens from Sokovia, knocked out the Vision, fought Thor (knocking his hammer out of his grasp) and nearly choked him to death, almost had the Avengers sacrifice himself to save the world, took on ALL the Avengers as an army, survived a triple blast from Iron Man/Thor/Vision and a punch from the Hulk, stole the Quinjet, injured Black Widow, killed Quicksilver, was seconds away from destroying the entire human race in a deem, made the entire nation of Sokovia homeless, turned Zemo into a villain, got Thor to leave the Avengers since Ultron was the one who brought the idea of someone (Thanos) assembling the Infinity Stones to him, got Tony to leave because of his creation in Ultron, got Hulk to leave because of what happened in South Africa (and why Hulk moved to whatever planet he's on now), got Hawkeye to leave for almost killing him, is the reason why the Avengers moved base, is the reason why Black Panther showed up at the UN, he's the reason Thanos got off his lazy ass to go get the Infinity Stones himself, is the reason Tony and Pepper broke up and is the main reason why the Sokovia accords exist in the first place thus beginning Civil War. He did that. He did all that in 3 days. Ultron in the comics wasn't close to that in his first appearance. He didn't destroy the human race, but he exposed the heroes' weaknesses and hit them where it hurt. Pretty powerful if you ask me.
1983	But then they'd buy unhealthy food like snacks full of corn syrup and chocolate milk.	Why don't you just give your kid money instead. Let him/her go to the local store and buy some food there? I feel bad for the kids.
1984	No, because the wrong party keeps messing things up so the right one can't do anything!	Politics. "Libtards are trying to take my rights!" "Conservatives are racist bigots!" If you think 'the other side' is to blame, you're the problem. It's not so easy as conservative this, liberal that, Republican this, Democrat that. If it was that easy then America would have virtually no problems whenever the 'correct' party won. Yet here we are, still with tons if problems. Also, the candidates. Where's the person who firmly believes in little control laws, but still does believe in universal background checks, but is also pro choice, but small government? Where's the guy who's in the middle and represents a moderate view that takes slightly from the left and slightly from the right, and is against money and corruption in politics? A few claim to tote those views, but where are they? I'll tell you where they *aren't*. They aren't in the front running and they won't be in the major debates. Until people stop getting brainwashed to vote "Trump or Clinton", it will always be this way (obviously different candidates in the future, but you know what I mean).
1985	RNG is RNG guys.	So I just got 2 legendaries from b2b court of stars level 2
1986	barnacle-encrusted gem, got it from a missions at my class hall	what toy is this? I need it.
1987	What are you, 15?	OP is 16 and this is more impressive than anything I've ever done.
1988	Violent games cause video behaviour	Violent behavior cause video games
1989	3 C1 for Chakrams?	Roadhog XL, Chakram Wheels plus different rare and very rare decals. Crates C1 ONLY Add me mish x Jack
1990	I'm just glad that MY town would never waste my tax dollars so foolishly!	Two month long undercover drug operation, in which officer worked at Burger King, netted 5 grams of Marijuana, 2 Pills
1991	Nobody will listen to you because you're a pinko commie bastardTM who wants to ruin the country	No this is completely 100% how capitalism works and I wish this myth would die. The state is inextricably tied to Capital. You can not have Capital without the state, you can not have the state without Capital. There were lots of bailouts in the Great Depression, was that not capitalism then either? It's a perpetual system of stealing from the lower classes. Start thinking about system change rather than reform.
1992	They anger me when they start hacking out a lung in the middle of class and place themselves in the position of patient zero it's really cool to be sick before everyone else, you're going against the plebs!	people who wear light jackets and thin, non-waterproof shoes to look cool actually anger me
1993	Unless it is a vote for Trump and then it sooooo important.	Liberals will because they're suckers for propaganda.
1994	Psh you can tell you're not actually from Beta or you would have called them actives, not relics	i found this relics in my old pc, so if you wanted to see how smite was in 2012, enjoy Note: if there is a problem with showing names, i can edit them
1995	Minecraft	I just bought a glorious 1440p/144Hz/G-Sync Monitor alongside a Zotac GTX 1070 AMP EXTREME! Recommend me some games!
1996	The article says "elite" athletes	If only Air Force had their own football team to study
1997	And nobody likes (accused) criminals so we might as well save the trouble altogether.	Thanks to Bush the Lesser that's now under dispute. Rights only apply if we like you, apparently.
1998	Lololol 420 bro omgggg this nigga smokin da herb ayyyyy	This hollowed out quarter with Washington smoking a blunt.
1999	What makes you think that?	i bet it's a wrap
2000	Obviously games at 50fps are more cinematic than 60/144 fps	Oh god, what kind of question is that?
2001	I have black friends but they're animals... Seems like a nice guy	(long anti-black rant)
2002	Are you sure that customer didn't buy a drink the moment you opened, downed it, and came up for a refill ~4 minutes later?	Every. Damn. Day
2003	Suits her for leaving the franchise!	Then bring her back, only to kill her off again. Except she wasn't and actually endured years of prison and interrogation, (presumable) rape, and betrayal by her own child which led to her death (again). She can't get a break, can she?
2004	Yeah that was right out in the open	The press is already moving on from Trump openly admitting to being a sex offender.
2005	Here let me help you with that...	My priority when I reddit is to get as much karma as possible. I decided long ago it's not my job to educate redditors, it's my job to get karma. Mind you, I'm not saying I'm rude to redditors, I'm fine striking up a friendly conversation, but in matters regarding unsolicited advice I recommend keeping your mouth shut unless it's a bridge you're forced to cross, redditors aren't going to be inclined to believe some random redditor on facts over their own understanding so don't waste your time arguing out of principal and risk getting downvoted. You got lucky they upvoted, but I've seen a lot of times a stubborn redditor make a person lose karma because the redditor wanted to argue
2006	Rather small in nature if false.	Big if true
2007	That's so british of you	Ah yes, my favourite actor, Gary Gustin.
2008	Sorry let me add	1. I'm female 2. Today is 19.10.2016 3. He saved them in the 1940s, not in 1988 because I'm pretty sure Hitler was dead and the war over by then
2009	if i had to guess, knowing how that brand markets, it's something along the lines of * 14% Cap Super Sweet * 3% TFA Watermelon Candy * 6% TFA Watermelon	Pop clouds Watermelon Candy recipe? So I'm thinking about jumping into making my own juice. I have a lot more research and considerations to make before I do, but I was wondering if anyone had a recipe for making something that tastes like Pop Clouds watermelon candy? Thanks in advance!
2010	Jean Valjean?	Who am I?
2011	How much is the monthly fee though?	Luckily, my other favorite service, bittorrent, still has a wonderful movie selection!
2012	People's opinions evolve bruh.	Trump in 2012 on deporting many undocumented immigrants: 'I don't believe in that'
2013	Don't break the law, you won't go to jail...	women in Chicago being arrested for wearing one piece bathing suits, without the required leg coverings. 1922
2014	yes because taking it out of the box destroys the box.	Why did you take Qui-Gon out the box :( Kinda kills it for in box collectors. I get that you would like others to see the whole mold, but at least wait to see if the person buying is an in box or OOB collector before doing that, because in box collectors don't care about the 360 degree view of the Pop because it's never going to be opened to begin with lol.
2015	We're missing the only true evil in this world, the devil incarnate: #MEI	We need more villain characters! We have 9 TRUE villians. Alarak is an anti hero and so is Sylvanas blah blah. I know this game is called Heroes of the Storm, but this game is lacking evil characters. Everyone loves a good villain (stares at Kel'thuzad) Any villians would be good.
2016	Why else would they be called a Democratic Republic, dumbass.	"Elected" Suuuure, North Korean elections...
2017	It's not real motorsport without twitter-fueled fanboost	Audi just quit Le Mans to focus on Formula E
2018	Ahh so we're gonna train with Southampton now...	Paul Joyce: Reds to merge first-team and academy set-ups
2019	But how else can I show off what a unique little snowflake I am?	Hide emblems?
2020	Forgot the	It's funny enough to be
2021	How can we possibly be expected to trust the NY Times with their obvious conservative bias?	U.S. Officials See No Direct Link Between Donald Trump and Russia
2022	cool	Zombies in Red Manor Callin it now the poster looks like a vampire zombie boooooy i hope so
2023	Jebus, take the vape	The battery, which is probably lithium. Poor quality, a defect, improper charging and overcharging can all cause the battery to explode.
2024	why does it seem like so many of them are terrible at winking?	Tzuyu attempting to wink
2025	It's like FKI Kozmo, only a bit more consistent and has access to a Pendulum Summon + Metalfoes Fusion monsters.	What about metalfoe kozmo? Been seeing that more when testing out decks on ygopro and devpro recently
2026	its not that bad you will lose some games and be placed in the good elo to be vs same level premade as you.	This certainly would decrease champion select problems. But what would be a huge disadvantage is that you still are a team of 5 randoms while in fact you are full premade and matchmaking will put you up against other 5 man teams every game which may not be a fun experience as they probably are more coordinated.
2027	In florida you can :P	Not at 14 you can't, at least not in most states. Nowadays most states you can't even get your permit until you're 16.
2028	Hell, we aren't entitled to know when *anyone* gets sick.	Sorry but you're not entitled to know when a candidate gets sick.
2029	You would pay taxes and fees anyways.	I found Aeroplan relatively useless for actual travel. Flights Halifax-London were $900 (this was 2012) to pay for. Using Aeroplan I needed to redeem 55,000 Aeroplan points AND pay $675 in taxes and fees. Not a great deal. I instead used the point for merchandise which was a much better value.
2030	yes, because everything has been decided on Nov 1.	Everyone gets their panties in a bunch because it's just one more example of the rampant bias inherent in these rankings. You can pretend that they're not trying to get two teams in from the same conference, but that's *exactly* how they're trying to set the table.
2031	oh my god... give them a PC case, you piece of wet food.	Ascended my neighbors with some parts I had laying around, they sold their consoles on craigslist used the funds to build their steam library
2032	oh snap, missed that lol, sorry	He said he can still use it though.
2033	Too little too late.	Germany has taken in too many migrants - now Europe needs to protect itself, warns expert
2034	Id buy it	what's the best advertising slogan you can come up with??
2035	Playboy doesn't allow nudes anymore :(	Overwatch version of Playboy magazine #1
2036	The Lost World, Jurassic Park, and Alien	What are your top 3 favorite movies of all time? I recently bought an Android TV box, which gives me access to an infinite amount of TV shows and movies. I really don't know what to watch, so I'm here to ask the friendliest subreddit in town their top 3 favorites.
2037	Literally cancer incarcerate.	His first comment was so cringe-worthy that he had to go an delete it. Or it was removed by a mod. Either way, how shitty does a comment need to be to be removed from r/pics?
2038	Hope he stays in Detroit and this is just for Upton's modeling related stuff.	TMZ is reporting Justin Verlander And Kate Upton Bought A House In Beverly Hills, 20 minutes from Dodger Stadium.
2039	Same here	As someone 6+ years deep on number 2, move on if you can.
2040	Thanks!	It's a fun innovative web scraping project. Kudos to you sir!
2041	'murica*	America*
2042	So are you saying that when referring to Tottenham as a group including the fanbase and players it's okay to say, *the* Spurs?	I think that's collectively referring to the group of fans/players hence they're "marching", whereas calling us "the Spurs" as a team isn't really the same thing as that.
2043	See my other comment for a description of my addictive tendencies but I have bipolar II	From my perspective, I've never met someone who had a "gateway drug" who did not also have serious mental health issues. Yes, addictive personalities exist, but I'd be willing to bet there's significant overlap between those with addictive personalities and other mental health issues (e.g. severe depression).
2044	expect in korea where mid will afk if you dont give them blue lul	So even more reason not to donate the buffs, I'm happy! :-)
2045	Kickers need some love too	Kickers hate posts.....
2046	Only a traitor to human race would want to be friends with xeno filth.	Why can't we just all stop fighting and be friends?
2047	Mike Pence must be triggered	TIL A zoo in Japan once spent four years trying to mate a pair of hyenas before realizing they were both males, due to how similar a female pseudo penis is to a real one.
2048	Scott realized his place was useless so he just decided to have the release date there.	Why do you think Ennard disappeared off the teaser?
2049	People still play this game?	Diablo 3 currently sucks dick and has been the same for the last 5 seasons. Necromancer doesn't fix that.
2050	Yup.	Angus?
2051	You don't, they are unreleased.	Where do you go on showdown to practice using the next gen mons?
2052	well that is a simple report and one less player will have an account	This is the angriest player I've seen in a decade of WoW
2053	What're skilling pets?	How did you get your skilling pet? Would be kinda cool to see if there are any types of training that occur often :) post your pet and how you got it below !
2054	That's fine, it would be fair then if we just re-wrote the laws to only apply to people with children then.	The point of government recognizing marriage is to promote the nuclear family and the rearing of the next generation. Not to legally endorse two people officially fucking each other.
2055	Lemme just rub this toxoplasma right in there.	Baby and Cat have a bonding session
2056	God bless the two party system.	If you aint last, you're first
2057	I see a lot of people swapping them into Foxbodies and Sn-95 (in the SN the motor bolts into the stock mounting location and fits perfectly)	I dunno, it's got some issues: too big, too scarce, too much of a pain in the ass. I've only seen a handful of them done so far.
2058	nice	*Are you part of the government? Cause I want you to fuck me.*
2059	Candyland.	What's the best torture you can think of that DOESNT involve pain?
2060	All depends on demand.	I was looking for the right comment to reply to to ask this but, as a k70 RGB owner and a recent TKL convert, I REALLY want to know if there will ever be a k65 RGB with mx blues/browns?
2061	Jesus take the wheel.	I do understand and am aware how deductibles work and how easily costs can run into the thousands... and I've even been unemployed. The reasons why I have health insurance and make pains paying it despite going up each year. You are making all these assumptions to paint a picture of me that isn't real. As for karma, I do not believe you understand how it works... first you have to believe in it.
2062	Aviation in general: where everyone is either a pilot or works in the tower.	Lol the air force. Where everyone is a pilot.
2063	I never said Nick was perfect but he is more convictions based compared to Trump but his policies are centre-left not centre-right.	Mate I went to Nick's website and clicked on his policies...No. Indigenous Australian are fucked because of too much welfare they need less not more. Climate change isn't happening. Gays are happy here they don't need to divorce as well. Where's my right to self defense back? Chkchk boom. I want a candidate that puts me first not everyone else.
2064	The alt-right and their cake lies!	Ah yes, the days when internet caused the French revolution.
2065	No, he's straight and watches gay porn.	oooo So is he gay? Does mommy know about it?
2066	No need for CDR pots when every item has it.	Health is completely different from Mana though. Health can be interacted with by both parties in a lane while Mana can only be used by the player. Mana potions are also not useable by all champions, there isn't a potion that increases energy regen, gives you fury, or reduces your cooldowns for a short while. While there are champions who health as a resource they are usually gated more by cooldowns then by their health costs (Morde after a ruby crystal for example). As noted below squishy champs are more likely to be bursted down then poked away. Potions can mitigate this somewhat if popped at an opportune time but no where to the degree that a mana potion will allow for some dominating a lane to keep up what is supposed to be a mana gated spell.
2067	Not if they remarry	At least 4 grandparents? Isn't 4 the maximum?
2068	0/10 not an actual gem.	So I found this gem on my phone today..
2069	android and ios have different multiplayer season end times	same for me
2070	These are badass man keep it up	Will try do all 30 teams, will be kinda hard coming up with something for teams like the sixers lol
2071	It's cool gurl	Yeah, I conflated the two for some reason. My bad lol
2072	I'm sorry, but I don't have the poeer to evolve a country... :,D otherwise, yes, I can do trade evos	Umm could u help me out I have two Pokemon that must be traded to evolve Abra and Hungary I need to lv up Abra to its second from but would u mind helping me out with those evolvetions
2073	They should make a sub for that.	Looking at two alternating pictures of the same table was oddly satisfying.
2074	Why would they ever change their ways if their ways get them elected?	If the electorate manages to punish the DNC through votes but not the republicans for what they've done, all you'll do is hand america to conservatives.
2075	Pro tools was my first DAW purchase (though I suppose I pirated cubase before, and it did come with my interface, and I'd already learned it at college and needed it for uni).	Well I'm not trying to say that Reaper is better (I primarily use Ableton, but I own Reaper and a few others). It's just that it's *so* cheap. There's no point in buying Ableton as your first DAW when it's expensive for reasons that aren't going to be immediately obvious. Personal preference is an entirely true statement, but no one would support Pro Tools as a first purchase (for example).
2076	Conversely: Inferno Rumble was the first time I've actually had fun in a Rumble match.	Rumble Supremacy is probably the least fun I've ever had in Destiny. Step 1: Spot Guardian Step 2: Trade shotguns kills Step 3: Third Guardian uninvolved in the fight picks up both crests. Rinse Repeat
2077	Hell Keith Hernandez is still raking in those "Coin Galleries of Oyster Bay" bucks.... or coins I guess	Mariano is still making shitty commercials to this day.
2078	Yeah except there is no second, third, or fourth bankruptcy in this endeavor.	Yeah because that strategy worked so well for you in the election. Trump is a delegator, a manager. All-talk campaigning isn't what he's best at. I think he's going to shock with how well he does.
2079	Who can you get?	Yep I'm physically ill as I had like 500k at the time to buy a ton. Then I think about players I can buy with the 60k profit I made and it helps a lil bit
2080	The galaxy phones are similar in prestige (at least in cost) and they alone are around the same sales as IPhone.	This is true. It's a known fact iPhone users spend more. Which is why advertising targets them.
2081	more than 100 posts in a day - someones been working hard!	Are *you* deluded by big business and the government? Who are you to assume that everyone else is? You give the establishment too much credit.
2082	To be fair, he denied saying that	Trump thinks climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese.
2083	Analogies only make sense if they match my agenda.	I am immediate using stealing this and using it on every liberal I encounter
2084	Try having sex after a penile fracture.	Doesn't matter. Had sex.
2085	Have you ever played morrowind?	Tip for anyone who hasn't experienced it yet: Don't fast travel! I've played this game for more than 1000 hours between my PS3 and my PC copy, I've replayed it a bunch of times with different characters and different play styles, but I always fast traveled. Now that SE came out, I made a new charscter and made the pledge to not fast travel with him. Ever. And it's an amazing experience. I constantly feel immersed, I find new and interesting characters, places and quests, I feel more like a resident of the world that has to run and get what he wants instead of relying on "pointing the map and saying go". If you're playing Skyrim and you haven't done it yet, DON'T fast travel. It's amazing.
2086	This is why all migrant countries should just be Saudi Arabia.	Islamic migrant kids threaten the Dutch people with death unless they convert to Islam.
2087	yea reddit totally doesn't say that blacks are criminal and should be trusted	But the media told me that only Trump's supporters were violent and racist.....
2088	Not running decathlons.	Fuck, what is he going by these days again?
2089	Aaaand that's you need the free press to make sure the government don't run wild.	Every wondered what the heck the Iran/Contra scandal was about? American Dad perfectly describes the history in an entertaining way.
2090	Kyrie tried way too hard there, but that was a good look to find Kevin.	Cleveland Cavaliers (6-1) @ Washington Wizards (2-5)
2091	Hey guys how about Barney Frank?	Lol this like is the donors' 5th test balloon in a few days. FUCK OFF. We said Keith. Did you people not hear us the first time?
2092	50/50 ---got to admit donnie's daddy was uhhh a special kind of scumbag;	I believe in nurture, not nature. Especially in this case.
2093	Pokemon Go!	What has been ruined by attracting a large audience?
2094	Here is my 7-1 :)	Romelu Lukaku (Belgium) goal against Estonia (7-1)
2095	I thought she was innocent	No one said anything about not sending Hillary along as well. And don't they have orange space suits still?
2096	i don't bruh that fps mode kinda makes it feel like grand theft farcry	"$180 for 3 versions of the exact same game club"
2097	I'll have to check it out.	Have you heard his actual music? Under the name Joji? Check it out on soundcloud, it's really really good.
2098	yea man cartoons are for kids.	Surprising as it might seem to you, there's plenty of people who simply don't care for anime, at all. So, there really is a huge amount of people waiting to get a look at the GITS world for the first time. And even as someone who has seen the anime version, I'm still really looking forward to seeing it in live action. It's not some sacred treasure to me, nor would the new movie being bad make the anime any worse.
2099	They only do that when a Kenyan usurper holds the presidency.	While Trump does seem to be more inclined to increase spending (has he mentioned "smaller government" or "deceased spending" even once?), it seems to me that the current Congress is a little more committed to reigning in spending than the 2000 Congress was.
2100	You lazy MF.	Is there an apps out there (iOS) that could consolidate all of my leagues to one app? Hey guys sorry if this is a repost. I am in leagues on yahoo, espn, and CBS and I hate jumping from app to app to check my scores. Are there any apps or websites out there that can keep track of everything in one place?
2101	Omg these are beautiful nails and I'm totally stealing them to impress my in-laws over Thanksgiving!	Finally came up with a perfect match for Essie Coat Couture
2102	Terrell Owens too	AB is the most of that group. I would add Jordy and AJ Green to that list.
2103	Shouldn't you be making fun of normies or complaining about how women don't like you on Red pill?	Downvotes? Let me laugh even harder... Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
2104	It's not as crazy as using your personal email for work.	This is not normal. This is not OK. This is batshit insane. What the fuck is going on that we're having to discuss stuff like this in relation to the President Elect?
2105	That schedule is beautiful	Exactly what I'm doing. Smith has been pretty consistent and getting Charles back will only help him.
2106	You should look at AMD's stocks ..	Good. I hope intel dies slow. They built they're empire on pure anti-competitive practices. I'll always remember you fondly AMD ;_;
2107	I let two pranksters to smoke out my house to see if my kids can come out	Have you ever experienced a situation so weird/absurd you thought it HAD to be a social experiment and what happened next?
2108	I played with C9 Stunna, the former coach of c9, we got 0-16'd partially because he was on the phone for half of the game.	Against what Pros did you play and how was your experience? Hey guys! I wondered if you played against Pros already and how your experience was, were they friendly, tryhard, toxic, etc? I've played against flamie + friends last night and he didn't say a word (like most pros when they play in public), but 2 of his friends were cursing us here and there. It was nice to see that flamie was very professional about the game and didn't join the flame-train.
2109	I would move the Washington Nationals to the AL East, and also move them to New York and rename them the New York Yankees, and I would move the Yankkes to the NL East and rename them the Washington Nationals, while moving them to Washington DC.	If you could realign the leagues, what teams would you move?
2110	Still unanswerable eh?	Lol
2111	I can take a screen cap when I get off work, I've made a total of 3 imbued bracers and finished the tailoring chain.	I'm going to call bullshit on this... As a tank chain running dungeons, taking the week off... I have 600 cloth in my bag. Unless there is some kind of perk for collecting cloth as a tailor.
2112	Only if fucking thorin didn't pick us to win damn man w.e the big one is coming up so let's hope OpTic qualifies for the major	I am extremely happy to a OpTic fan at this moment. All of our teams made it to the finals, even if GOW &amp; COD(online tournament) is the only teams to win their tournaments, what other ORG can say all their teams made it to the finals. #GOGREENWALL
2113	It's just the way the light is hitting it folks.	The Walking Dead and the magically changing spoon
2114	Well, I'm already MAD after just one placement match	People will be MAD because of their rank after placement matches. In season 3 they adjusted the ratings so that not everyone would be gold and platinum, meaning if you're in the low part of those ranks you will be a lot lower this season just to even out the ranks. But more important maybe: Your rank will be lower after placements than the system thinks might be your skill. In other words: peoples ranks will be way lower than season 2 and people don't understand this is good so they think the system is broken and they should've been higher. We had the same problem with cs go when the ranks got changed so everyone got pushed down and everyone thought the system was miscalculating their skill.
2115	"Eric and Tony are as unbiased as they come" You forgot the	He has a point, for this game at least. Eric and Tony are as unbiased as they come and they weren't happy with the two calls that forced Hassan out of a majority of the game
2116	This is proof that automation reduces the demand for labour!	Wal-Mart's Dallas optical lab loses 91 jobs to automation
2117	masterbaiter	masturbaiter
2118	Someone's sounding awfully like a communist.	I'd gladly pay more taxes if the rich were paying far more as well, with increasingly progressive taxation, and the government were creating a social safety net, with access to education, healthcare, and strong wages, as well as some kind of better wage protection or disability protection if things go wrong for me. I don't expect I'll ever have to use much of it, but know its there is worth the peace of mind of a small middle class tax hike, if necessary. Especially if it creates a stronger middle class, which I believe it does. I don't want to pay more taxes to increase the wealth divide in our country or while we continue to gut the social safety net. Not so hard to tell the difference, really.
2119	maybe Tico has ascended to a point where his general skills are so legendary that even the legend of total war cant take his ranking away xd	the ranking changes does actually occur immediately. You can easily go check the ladder right now and see im still in exactly the same position.
2120	Now navigate to your Amazon Orders page and initiate the return.	R.I.P 750ti. You served me well.
2121	If they start Romo, do you think that will affect Bailey?	I'd scoop Hopkins for now and look to scoop up Bailey next week. If you miss him, you'll be able to get by just fine streaming until another opportunity opens up.
2122	Right, we can never have problems with a candidate, we must toe the line and worship them.	concern troll.
2123	Trump will fix it his first day....	Yeah, it's a scam but it's not a drink cyanide cult so I don't see any government intervention happening.
2124	Not misleading, just plain stupid	That graph starting at 50 is pretty misleading IMO
2125	Pfftt...liberal elite with their facts and studies.	'Tidal wave of Hep. C coming,' health commissioner warns
2126	Pants shopping is suck	- December 16, 2016 Here is our Weekly Weightlifting Friday chat thread! Feel free to discuss whatever weightlifting related topics you like, but please remember to abide by the sub's rules.
2127	Lore solved.	The real reason behind Afton's crimes after SisLoc, and why he always goes for Freddy Fazbear locations. Picture our old pal he's had a bad day. He has a difficult job, problems at home, he's a rotting corpse... but he gets by. It's all worth it because he can get home and relax with an episode of "The Immortal and the Restless", his all-time favourite show. He lets out a sigh, and his weary body collapses into his chair. It's been a long day, but it's worth it; he's had to wait a long time, but season 2 is finally here. He finally gets to see what happens with the baby! He can't contain himself, he's so hyped up for this, he can't stand it! He turns the TV on, changes the channel and, as the clock strikes 7:00... his favourite show is nowhere to be seen. He reels back, shocked. Surely, this is a mistake? A scheduling error? He's so concerned that he calls the network directly. He has to get to the bottom of this. After being kept on hold for about 20 minutes, he gets an answer. He begs them, pleads with them to tell him that there's been some kind of mistake. That his show will be back tomorrow night, or next week, right? "I'm sorry sir, but 'The Immortal and the Restless' is no longer airing on this channel." He goes from worried to furious. This was the ONLY channel it aired on! If they stopped airing it, it was as good as cancelled! He pushed them to see reason, but they wouldn't budge. He knew it was no good, but he needed SOME form of closure. He had to ask... WHY did they stop airing it? "Well, sir, it's an extremely popular timeslot. Just when the adults are settling down, just before the kids have to go to bed. That's when most of the viewers come in, and another show was willing to pay more for the slot." He dreaded the answer, he didn't know if he even cared all that much, but he needed to know. He couldn't let this go. If they were going to cancel HIS show, get rid of the one thing he looked forward to in the evenings... he was damn sure he'd know who was doing it. "It's a pretty new show, sir, aimed at a family audience. It's really taking off, especially with the kids, but-" He had to interrupt. He didn't CARE about how popular the show was (People these days just didn't have good tastes, that was all), he just wanted the name. Well, he didn't even really want to hear it at this point, but having come this far, he was going to get to the end of this. "Fredbear &amp; Friends".
2128	Maybe Taylor will do the same thing and peace out to Calgary	It's hard for us to trust ever since Kovy said "PSYCHE!" and peaced out to Russia.
2129	what better time to do it then a new president coming is who is going to drain the swamp.	We need to close that loophole!
2130	Try putting a passcode on your phone.	God damn I had forgotten about hold switches! New smartphones have all kinds of dumb ways to turn themselves on when in your pocket. If I had a hold switch on my phone, I would never end up butt dialing anyone.
2131	tangible results.	Para sa mga troll na nagsasabing walang nagawa ang VP

2136	Always a little shit I see.	Bill Nye in his 9th grade science class
2137	MLS really needs to change to a winter schedule	No team is going to play up to top standards on a December night in Toronto. MLS needs to change their playoff scheduling. It's always been an issue when they're not playing in LA
2138	Anybody have a clip of the sequence where he got ejected?	LUKE WALTON FIRST EJECTION UPVOTE PARTY! i love basketball and i love seeing our coach get so FIERY!
2139	I want any games to play with weed with friends not just movies	Movie smoking games like drinking games Hello fellow Ents! I'm looking for smoking games of a similar format to drinking games for movies or tv shows. Like the "take a drink/toke when x happens" variety. Does anybody have any rulesets for movies or tv shows that they play with? They don't have to be stoner movies or anything specific like that. I'm asking here specifically because I think that smoking games might have different rules due to the frequency of actions in a movie and the desire to actually stay awake through the entire movie ;)
2140	No it was obviously all Comcast fault	That black pick-up was driving wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too fast.
2141	Is this a repost from last year?	Eddie Lacy plans to lose weight this offseason
2142	Cock-a-doodle-do, we're a huge corporation...	Haha cluckin bell
2143	Yes that especially affected the CDN stocks	Don't panic, EVERYTHING was down today Fed rate hike, just about everything saw red today, even the Trump stocks. We should get a bounce once things settle.
2144	If you are not supporting Hillary, then you have to be racist, sexist, raping Trump supporter	This isn't even from the Trump campaign you fucking moron
2145	I guess it was the russians again?	IIRC I'm fairly certain someone found evidence of bots and vote manipulation going on with the Donald.
2146	But everyone knows you're not allowed to make Muslims look good in any way possible.	Muslims cant win in this sub. Muslims do something bad: FUCK THEM ALL Muslims do something good: What does religion have to do with it?
2147	Yeah, they're going against the Jags.	Please tell me that Houston is playing today.

2150	Elm Creek?	NBD! Felt DD 10
2151	Theres an interesting documentary about his life on netflix.	"I hate the whole damned human race, including myself..." Carl Panzram's autobiography, scrawled on prison paper before his execution, has been digitized.
2152	just wait for the update s87 is going to be much better	So you chose between DPS and accuracy then? I don't play s67 much.
2153	It only ever showed up every 5 pitches... which isnt very useful	Last game they tested a pitch counter during the middle of the game. It flashed for a split second and then disappeared. I kept assuming they would try to get it on there during a commercial break, but it never happened.

2160	egg logia, I'm calling it.	I know a lot of people are saying Tamago might be some kind of homie, but I think a new and bizarre devil fruit is more interesting and likely.
2161	You shouldn't complain because most poors in the US have indoor plumbing, refrigerators, and television sets.	Share of total US income by percentile
2162	I think this in a hypothetical world where the "free market" dictates everything, welfare is public sector interventionism and "theft" through taxes, using "socialism" to redistribute "hard earned money" from "workers" to "parasites".	No they wouldn't. They could live better off of welfare. There is literally no reason to take them.
2163	We already have that in Iraq and Syria, it's just going so well!	I wish for the ikhwan ideology to rule the muslim world.
2164	Ya LoL is total p2w garbage	As others have already mentioned, it's accurate in the sense that PC games did generate that revenue, but it's misleading in that it if you take into account AAA games only, the revenue is nowhere near that, as most of it's from F2P with all their pay to win content.
2165	Don't you know all we need is more prisons.	I don't know that Trump has ever shown to support this idea, but even if he did, the establishment Republicans would never let him do it. Sessions is a "law and order" guy, so he will presumably get "tougher" on crime. The US has 4% of the world's population, yet our prisoners represent 22% of all imprisoned people *in the world*, but somehow there aren't enough people in jail in this country?
2166	My mortgage broker says it's different this time	These people are going to be bleeding so badly when the next recession arrives. Amazon at 175 PE can't last forever...

2168	BUT IT WAS THE BEST PODCAST EVER AND WE SHOULD ALL COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE GIMLET SCREWED US	Sorry. Lazy phrasing on my part. What I meant was, in my opinion, the show is not something so incredibly amazing that I'd risk inducing a panic attack for myself by listening to it. Didn't mean to sound insensitive.
2169	Allen is a pure class athlete	Grayson Allen executing the rare head-flop-into-body flop

2173	Phantom Chica.	What animatronic scares you the most? Title. This is where I would usually put an example of the animatronic that scares me the most, but I'm not really scared of any of them.
2174	Hey, at least you knew everyone's name who worked there!	100% this. I feel like I actually get better service because all future shop did was try to sell me extended warranties (what they made the most commission off of).

2176	at first look I was amazed as well, but when you really look at it it's *very* sloppy with a lot of skin showing, it has nothing on Phi Phi's cosplay runway	Now I'm worried for katya since the blue look might bring team Alaska back, This is some rollercoaster of emotions tomfoolery right here.
2177	Consider this: It's not a DLC but instead you're buying the option to host a private server, which would fit the title.	While true, It would take developers away from working on the main game to work on the DLC.
2178	Downvote for not using Linux with it	Upvote for the Mr. Robot wallpaper!
2179	Corrupt nazi mods gg	If I know the person personally and they are my friend, yes lol

2183	Yeah, cause Conservative parties sure got more done than just talking about pipelines....	talk is cheap.
2184	Yeah but they're in different universes idiot	Who's that?
2185	Right, racists flip all the time.	Ah yes, lets cite a 10 month old poll from a Democratic affiliated polling group as undeniable fact. 10/10 would r/politics again.
2186	"She was just very emotional, as she was deeply affected by this tragedy"	I'm just here to watch everything get deleted
2187	Yea I was having the same issue on post fades Ive just moved to using the button for it even on absolute I get a lot of red angles so instead of penalizing myself I just went with the button	I may give it a chance. Personally, I think it's easier to remember to just aim the analog towards the baseline for a reverse and away for a normal lay-in. I feel the analog still works well with post moves for sure, but I can't seem to attempt a post fadeaway without getting red angle feedback. Do you have the same issue? I have a feeling it is unavoidable and maybe doesn't hurt the shot rating in these cases
2188	Oh shit look at this badass over here.	To me, every tattoo is a white girl tattoo. I never see anyone covered in tatts who's ass I couldn't kick.
2189	But the costumes aren't yellow so obviously the movies are fucking terrible.	I love the circlejerk so much. Yes, fuck Fox. Not like they gave us X-Men, X2, First Class, Days of Future Past and Deadpool. YEAH, FUCK FOX!
2190	Once a nazi, always a nazi, didn't you know it?	article from 2012 - seriously ?
2191	Except those gamers who buy his games and don't like them... those guys are clearly SC shills.	Derek Smart on Twitter: "I've always had a low tolerance threshold for bullshit. since I'm only professionally beholden to gamers who buy my games, all else is noise"
2192	But but but, Renaud Lavoie said Montreal wasn't interested in him anymore!	Shipashov Update: "Vadim Shipachev confirms he will complete his contract in the KHL and consider a move to NHL next season. Said 3-5 teams expressed interest"

2198	Sounds like a pretty typical Patriots response...	Teams would be stupid not to look at opposing team's hand signals. Teams would also be stupid not to change their hand signals frequently
2199	Anything that doesn't agree with my preconceived notions of what happened I will reject as being manipulated by the government.	TIL That originally to be kept secret until 2029, all existing documents related to the John F. Kennedy assassination will be publicly disclosed by October 2017.
2200	Gorgeous	Over-accessorized and texting while shooting
2201	I mean it wouldn't be half-bad	Just trying to get in here before anyone legitimately suggests it. You know someone will.
2202	Maybe you should stop assuming women's ages and marital status, shitlord.	I grew up in Texas where everyone calls any woman they don't know ma'am. Move to Wisconsin and I get chewed out left and right for calling women ma'am. Apparently up here it means you're calling someone old? Wtf? What am I supposed to call you? Miss? I'M MARRIED! Mrs? I'M NOT MARRIED! Ma'am? I'M NOT OLD YOU ASSHOLE! OK then cunt. Have it your way.

2205	"It's ok, just as long as my team wins."	Yeah. Good thing they elected congresses with the express intention to not govern, but rather to be as obstructionist as possible at all times. Imagine what he could have accomplished with a less intransigent bunch of amateurs in congress. Now, look at where the US actually is today. Sad, ain't it?
2206	That sounds kinda hawt	Welp, i'm screwed lads. Mark my words.
2207	she was denied a meatball sub!	She never really got denied, so..
2208	but it's not sexism if it's against males	When I heard this I thought for sure it was just going to be "The old boys club" swinging the other way, but it's hard to see purging enough senior editorial staff and replacing them almost exclusively with women to go from 20% female to 80% female in 18 months as anything BUT straight up gender discrimination.
2209	Who did you fuck for that flair?	He's still one of the best fielders in baseball. I don't see that changing any time soon.
2210	How do you like the Trunite T10T?	Titanium Carry
2211	Yeah, screw Bernie for not running on Hillary's platform instead of his own.	FUCK YOU BERNIE SANDERS Watching Trump use Bernie Sanders to attack Hillary is infuriating. Seriously fuck you Bernie Sanders you piece of shit.
2212	You forgot the	Buzzfeed is awesome though!
2213	Locker room banter	Trump urges people to vote - on wrong date
2214	You're too close to Holland so you don't count.	Im dutch...We refer to the Netherlands as Holland all the time. Im from Utrecht and we still call it Holland. There may a geographical difference but the people dont make that distinction. Holland is the Netherlands, the Netherlands is Holland.
2215	Yeah what a fucking dick trying to help clarify things	Lol do we still need to explain how a free game works? Kinda obvious it will stay in your library after you claim it.
2216	No, because that would be unfair to Hilary.	If you're going to use a video from 2011, then I guess I can use Clinton's stance on gay marriage from 2011.
2217	reading that book of course	What is that?
2218	The green ones are my favorite.	Actually, it was very tasty. I suppose it may have been improved with further ripening, but it was pretty much like candy.
2219	Don't take my operator	For the love of God, stop f**king team killing. I was playing in casual with my friend and a group of guys who were clearly together in a party. Someone votes to kick me, I guess he wanted the Operator I had, except he didn't communicate (message or voice chat) that he wanted that specific Operator at all. One round goes by, at the start of the second round for no reason at all they kick my other friend. The round starts and they team kill and kick me. If you're playing with a group of friends, don't be a f*cking a**hole and ruin it for everyone else.
2220	Wow omg I love the particles on a champ I'm never going to play omg hype hype.	I find the quality really good with his new particles and stuff
2221	Hey, we got bloom, didn't we?	They really need to improve this game optimalization
2222	Also the artist behind smash hit song "My Nigga," no he's not racist at all.	Rapper YG, known for his song"Fuck Donald Trump" where he labels Trump racist, is getting crushed for being racist in one of his own songs

2225	Get NVIDIA hardware	Wolfenstein: The New Order runs really bad on AMD hardware. Have you got any solutions? I have two r9 290s, fx 8350 and 16gb ram, I can't find any configuration for the new order that makes it run even above 40fps average. It doesn't even look that good at all. I disabled crossfire because it clearly isn't supported, I tried forcing AA and AF through the radeon software, I tried even playing on the lowest settings and it still doesn't run at 60 fps smoothly. What's going on and how can I solve this?
2226	This disgusts me... it's _whom_, you swine.	"So, who are you voting for in the election..."
2227	I wonder if Reddit will send them dildos instead of snacks, too.	They've set a tractor on fire and fired shots. They were never peaceful, this is just stripping off the mask.
2228	You can get a number of certs for 125-200 dollars.	Do remember how much it costs? My funds are very limited due to having my first child on the way
2229	So I guess nonconformist 1 &amp; 2 were taken?	John is a shithead. Sorry wait, the network is a shithead and he is a puppet. Regardless, it's all bullshit in Media. Don't listen to them.
2230	Fireball and Firelands Portal are commons and this is okay	I've been playing almost 2 years and arena class balance has always been a complete joke.
2231	Who had zardari arrested for being corrupt... My country never ceases to amaze me.	Actually, most people in Pakistan are of the view that India is attacking the line of control to distract the army from the upcoming impeachment proceedings against Nawaz Sharif, the massively corrupt, pro-Indian, anti-army prime minister.

2233	How?	Seitz save vs. Seattle
2234	Why would you want the control of it then?	Are there any mods that allow me to gain land without settling it? In one of my games, there's a massive desert next to me. The desert is just that - a desert. There's no resources or rivers or anything, it's just all desert. I have want to have control of the desert but the only way for me to do that would be to send out tons of settlers to establish basically throwaway cities with nothing around them just for the land. Buying won't work because you can only buy so much around your cities, so the same issue stands. So are there any mods that would enable me to claim land without having to settle it?
2235	Most stun guns are single shot, so they wouldn't be able to deal with more than one person at a time.	Wonder what happens when someone tackles one, takes the stun gun, and uses it to start neutralizing the crew.
2236	Whisper is the crying child and he did the bite of 87	Try to make the worst theory possible If you didn't already know, someone at the steam community decided to do a "make the worst theory" post, so why not make one here. I also made a "what's the worst theory you heard of" post on reddit, so yeah.
2237	No I wanted him to win the DNC nomination so I didn't have to vote for tiny hands cheeto	He was very upfront from the beginning that his campaign was largely a just a protest run. He told people from the beginning that he would support HRC over any republican. If his supporters were too retarded to understand that he would do the exact thing he said he would do from the beginning, how is that Bernie's fault? You don't want him to support Trump, you just want him to split the progressive electorate so the cheeto face retard can win. That was never what his campaign was about.
2238	I never hit greens, so this is something I don't have to worry about...	For the love of Golf Please fix your ball marks on the greens. Better yet, repair two or three. Also, if you ever see someone repair them the wrong way (Down into the divot and push up instead of the in, push, and twist) teach them!
2239	g2 might make sense, but na'vi for example shouldn't have left train available for sk twice, since they knew sk would ban cache anyway	You don't understand, G2 NEVER play Mirage, it would be even worse.
2240	I was thinking they wouldn't be physical buttons, but on screen like on mobile.	That would make the controls unusable, though, unless you took them off. In which case, you can't use the touchscreen you'll need if it's 3DS-compatible. Looks like we can't win.
2241	Looked like a really fun tournament!	Smash @ Power 9 - Week 3 Highlights - feat. 805, Irvine, Lucky, and More of SoCal!
2242	Unless they have come against Trump vote Republican	Group Consensus: What are your thoughts on down ticket votes? So I'm in Florida and I think Rubio has earned a vote from me for not ditching trump but I'm kind of conflicted. I'm looking at my sample ballot and a lot of the Rs don't even have any positions on trump so I'm not even sure if I should vote down ballot for them. What do you guys think?
2243	Jason Kander's "concession" post is everything I needed to start moving forward again.	Let's Curate Some Role Models Hey, bromos. In light George Wallace Orange Edition getting elected, I thought it would nice to put together a list of examples of how to stick to you morals when the system around you is completely fucked. Movies, books, fiction, real life, whatever inspires you.
2244	Not sure why I was downvoted (inconvenient truth perhaps); I was referring to RoI, hence why I said "now".	I can't say reguarding RoI drops, but definitely not the case in TTK. Those were some of the easiest drops, especially considering some were quest rewards.
2245	All true.	I'd respect his professional work. I wouldn't respect his politics or analytical skills and reasoning, or his xenophobia. We are large. We contain multitudes. I don't have to respect someone all or nothing.
2246	Whether you find it funny or not it's considered a "Teen comedy."	"Fast Times at Ridgemont High" isn't really a comedy.
2247	Dude's buying new/newish, everything's covered under warranty.	Honestly I make about half what you will but I wouldn't buy a European luxury car even if I made 200k a year. You really have to love these cars to be ok with spending the crazy amounts of money necessary when it comes time for a repair.
2248	CHOWDA	*chowdah
2249	I mean they're two different beasts, I'm planning on getting Blops on PC for mod tools	Sure do miss The Origins Crew Sure do miss all of them its just not the same playing ZIS. I really am becoming a very casual player now. Anyone else having this problem? I actually kinda started moving back to Black Ops 3 because I still think it fits my style.
2250	I guess we're lying now?	Great looking lady.
2251	I thought the translation was much harsher than the original mandarin.	If you understand Mandarin, you'd find that the translated subs were less harsh than the original.

2253	People with OP can still help you They can get engines to help you	Trouble with the Siva Engine part for outbreak prime So, I have completed everything prior to this part and just finished nightfall with a titan and warlock (as I am a hunter myself) with people who already have Outbreak. So now I am stuck at the Siva engine and can't move forward. Is there any way I can fix this? [Question]

2255	Are you implying that was good?	I suppose many Trump supporters were not around during the Cold War
2256	nasus's biggest counter is a jungler	Guys, how do you counter nasus E max early game. I played teemo and got shat on by nasus who maxed E. im not btchin, i just wonder what couldve i did that would get me an advantage, for future reference.

I know this would be a long process from getting the fame to getting the feed power , but has anyone reached a f2p divine pet before and how would they have done it / the easiest(relatively) shortest way to undertake to get to that stage and I got now a relatively underleveled legendary pet Yes I got a lot of free time and I can purchase gold for the pet yard upgrade

2266	Who on earth recommended Sweden for beginners?	Game help So, I'm fairly new to EU4. I have the el dorado dlc only. I'm used to playing hearts of iron and Victoria 2. I heard Sweden is a good nation for beginners and I'm playing but every time I go to war for independence from Denmark (I have Scotland, Novgorod and England supporting me) I can't win. Most recent attempt I was able to find the bulk of the Danish army fighting rebels and retaking a province so I jumped on the opportunity and killed them but just a few minutes later after sieging their land in Sweden they came back with Holstein with 36k troops. Is there a better way to do this?
2267	No, it doesn't.	I'm drunk af, this nugget looks like it's saying "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT"
2268	In hindsight I guess.	Man Alienware made some fugly ass computers back in the day.
2269	mike10d will do that anyway after he is done with the teaching lesson.	I know, i just wanna put all stuff like that into 1 post.
2270	TBH fam I think I searched for something in the domreddit and totally forgot I was commenting on a 3 month old post	This is 100% true. These are also folks that will jump at the first thing that agrees with their narrative, instead of looking into things to gain their own perspective. One thing this ride has given me is a renewed faith in my fellow Americans, regardless of color. It's been amazing how positive the experiences i've had, by seeing us as Americans first. I even took color out of discussions with my 5 year old. We watch shows and i'll say, 'that guy is funny' or 'that woman is smart and beautiful' instead of adding in that they are American Africans etc. She is seeing people for who they are, not what they look like. I'm sorry, but it's blowing my mind: that you are now replying to an 80 day old post! Not accusing you of anything here, it's just strange!
2271	No necessarily true... a lot of them were thrown in there because of suspicions and bullshit "trials".	so did people in prison in cuba....... see how that's a dumb argument? when you can make unjust laws, they are all worthless.
2272	Oh fuck I am SOOOOOO sorry I literally was having a conversation with my friend and he said a trebuchet was a type of catapult so I googled it to prove him wrong, but he was right so I decided to make a post about it and blasphemy was the first title that came into my head, I didn't copy you, but I feel bad for making you feel like I copied you :(	Woah, dude. Way to just take my idea. No. It's fine. I'M NOT ANGRY!!!!!

2274	Congrats, you fell for his act.	Wow there's a TON of hating here. You guys all seem really insecure. Guess I should have expected that on reddit. I've heard a ton of comments on this guy about him being fake, how his dad is this and that, he's a liar, you name it, and before this interview my perception of him was highly impacted by these sentiments and I didn't have a very high amount of respect for him. But after watching this podcast, my perception totally shifted and he seems like one of the coolest, realest, and (relative to his fortune and experiences) humble dudes. I did not see a douche talking to Joe and fuck, I would love to live this guy's life even if I had to put up with the constant projection of insecurity on him that this thread just shows is still going strong.

2281	Just roll of shame it dude.	Warming up on my poverty bench this morning, going for a 195 for 1+ reps (per 2suns 531). Normally my local gym bro Danny would be around and could give me a spot. today he's nowhere to be seen. An older dude behind me is benching 95 lbs with gloves on. I see him at the gym every day in his Michigan sweatshirt, and desperate to not commit bench seppuku, I kindly ask him for a squat. Dude looks at me grimly and says "sorry, i don't want to be responsible". I was dumbstruck. And then I got angry. Jesus christ man i'm not asking you to spot me on a 315 bench for reps! Dude basically ruined the rest of my set, and my workout I was so angry. Am I crazy here? Is a spot for a low level, albeit heavy for me, bench too much to ask, old man? And thus my bench will forever remain shit.
2282	What a scrub, can't believe he missed 2.	Kawhi Leonard is shooting 61/63 (96.8%) from the free-throw line this season He shot 87.4% from the line last season, and 80.2% from the line the season before that. On the flip side, Kawhi is shooting 33.3% from the 3-point line this season after shooting 44.3% from the 3-point line last year. Other than that, Kawhi is (as of now) having a career year in points per game, steals per game (slightly), and assists per game.
2283	Nah, the others won in playoff	Marvin Lewis anyone?
2284	He said nothing about jews	Yeah - No Joke - Today Trump Said today "We've seen this first hand in the wikileaks documents, in which Hilary Clinton meets in secret with international banks, to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global interests powers, her special interest friends, and her donors." Make no mistake - this is Antisemitism. This is a replay of centuries old nonsense about Jews trying to run the world with Secret Banks. This is terrifying.
2285	I was so surprised by episode 7, I thought YOI was going to be like every other sports anime and just be queerbaiting the whole way through, It's nice to see LGBT representation in a show where the main focus isn't the relationship.	OMG. I'm not even the screaming fangirl type. But *that* scene in Episode 7. Hot damn. You should look up some of the YouTube reaction videos. Every single person, man or woman, gay or straight, pretty much at least jaw-dropped then cheered. Fuck, this might be my OTP of all time or something.
2286	r/nba doesn't even give a fuck about Wall in general, doubt they would care about this.	Probably the only positive outcome is that Otto looked good and we may see a gif of Wall on r/nba for breaking the record

2288	That's the thing about online polls; they're vulnerable tip brigading and whoever spends more time online can be overrepresented because they have more exposure to these kinds of things.	How long until they cry censorship after someone closes a poll they brigaded?

Lately there seems to be a resurgence in deep dish-style pie, which is refreshing. Mostly I stick to Dulono's, etc. -Summit is borderline overlooked these days, which is a shame because they offer a lot besides Pale Ale and IPAs, seriously, dig into their offerings -I worry that Minneapolis is on its way to becoming "the Seattle on the prairie" which would be awful -Northeast Minneapolis *is* beautiful and has character, but all you motherfuckers ruined it with your arts culture -Surly makes solid beer, but I'm turned off of it by the cult culture -I don't give a shit about Cthulhu and everyone here seems to think he's "the best" -The first-ring suburbs aren't so bad and don't deserve so much scorn -I don't think people should have chickens in the city -Little Tijuana's is awful, even for drunk food -Psycho Suzi's isn't worth it unless you get takeout -People don't talk enough about the downsides of being a bike-friendly city -Saint Paul is generally underrated; let's hope it stays that way

2326	I agree on Miller	He's better and more consistent than Colin Miller and Joe morrow.
2327	Yeah, and most suplex technique guys learn in the US is about scoring points wrestling and staying in control, not spiking and koing people	Seems like a good time to point this out. Chandler mentions in this clip that he wasn't sure to go for the suplex because of how much energy it takes and because it's hard to KO people with. The suplexes most likely KO or seriously damage people are the ones at a drastic angle, such that you turn your hips even more and spike people on their head or shoulder. You need some horsepower to pull these off (Randleman on Fedor), but stellar technique will get you a long way (Khabilov vs. Pinchel). Compare those examples to Chandler's or when Dominic Cruz suplexed Mighty Mouse and you can see the difference.

De dames waar dit over gaat zullen in de toekomst vast hun boerka netjes af doen in plaatst van dat ze nog minder redenen zien om naar buiten te gaan en contact te maken met de Nederlandse samenleving. Daar zal vast niks negatiefs uit komen.

2333	Ah that would be a very good reason.	It'd be saving me about $50-$70 dollars is the only reason. I'm on a tight budget having bought both my gigging amplifier and guitar this year along with everything else that entails.
2334	Only good thing Jimmy Dore has done this election is spitting on Alex Jones' face	I can't stand Jimmy Dore. Out of all of them, he's the one I loathe the most. Every time he opens his mouth, I cringe. Jimmy hates Obama. There was one video where I think he was basically comparing Obama to Trump, as being the same, it's just Trump is "ugly" and not hidden behind a pretty face/lies whereas Obama is. Hell, Obama hasn't been perfect but he's been a damn good President. He's pulled the country out of tough times. As the link shows, he's helped those same people that chose to vote against their own best interests because of feelings and not being able to see the big picture. The Democrats have always stood with the working class. ALWAYS. How quickly they all forget. I am afraid mostly because going forward, this is how it will be. We'll be fighting within our own party because of these fools. Constantly attacking Democrats. Constantly spreading false narratives. Constantly tearing down any candidate that doesn't pass their purity test and is labeled as establishment.
2335	Citation needed	No they don't. I know plenty of people in the very poor parts of my town who don't have bank accounts or medicare our anything of the sort. Just because you assume those things are required for modern life doesn't mean they are.

Its not, oh I don't know, because people who can't find work and can't afford to spend money need a free/cheap way to occupy all their time?!?!

I have two pending $700 charges (one for the actual order, one for an order I cancelled). I thought they don't charge the card until after it ships (which it obviously hasn't)?
2341	And gamergate is about ethics in game journalism, and flying the Confederate flag is about celebrating Southern US history	That's not correct at all. TRP is all about how to improve yourself so that you can become more successful in the modern dating scene in light of recently published peer-reviewed articles on gender differences and evo-psych. That's why the first tip is to lift and the second is to not come off as an emotionally needy bitch by developing a sense of abundance (i.e. personal empowerment in the sexual market place). Most outsiders are looking to condemn and thus don't look past posts that are in the anger phase.

To be fair in his book (End of faith), he does make some sweeping statements about "Muslims" but in his podcast he has done a series where he reads through his book chapter by chapter and he has walked back some of those statements and made it clear that he is talking about radicals and he no longer means to imply *all muslims*.

You can always see your top artists, songs, and albums, but once a year they do a massive statistic drop for you.

2372	I have it on good authority that everything you said was a separate false flag operation.	The two are still very different in many ways. Most glaring differences: **Proof**: Pizzagate: weird wording found in hacked emails. Logo reminds some people of bad things. Trump/Russia: documented and publicly acknowledged financial ties. Request by the president elect for russia to get involved by hacking emails- a request they granted. **official investigation results** Pizzagate: they don't even have a basement, what are these people smoking? Trump/Russia: multiple federal agencies have confidence that Russia intervened to assist Trump in the election. Russia confirmed direct communications with the campaign. **journalists** Pizzagate: only Alt-Right pro Trump outlets take this seriously. Trump/Russia: only Alt-Right pro Trump outlets are not taking this seriously. **precedent** Pizzagate: pizza places that operate like comet are typically normal pizza places. Trump/Russia: politicians who operate like Trump are typically very corrupt. **transparency** Pizzagate: comet has welcomed investigation. Invited Pence to visit. Trump/Russia: tax records hidden. Ties denied/concealed. Manafort was fired for links but kept onboard on the downlow. **political response** Pizzagate: pols from both sides of the aisle have said this is baseless &amp; harmful Trump/Russia: pols from both sides of the aisle have called for investigation. Conflating the two issues is either evidence of a deep ignorance surrounding the two issues, or an intentional false equivalency intended to minimize Trump's conflicts of interest.

2377	Nah, I think he's just responding to the OP with something he's heard from fellow car people.	No it's not.
2378	It's as if the justices aren't just stereotypes of conservative and liberal but actually complex people who know the difference between right and wrong, who would have thought it.	Right -- and the 5th -- an even more conservative court handed down that other recent decision overturning the Texas voting ID law -- also finding it to blatantly discriminate . Just goes to show a) legislators are pandering more or becoming more extreme and/or b) traditionally conservative courts are still doing their jobs. Probably a bit of both. I will say that SCOTUS (with Scalia) has been so pro-business it's astounding (IMO). Yes they've delivered some surprisingly "liberal" opinions on domestic issues but fuck all when it effects big business -- they have been siding with them over employees and consumers for the past 50 years. P.S. I'm a Warren/Brennan Court fan myself if that tells you anything.

2380	Hey jr designer and art director here, cannot wait	I am an advertiser (copywriter.) When I was young, I thought it would be a great business to get in. To be creative, come up with commercials (like my hero at the time Ridley Scott) was all I wanted. Now 30 years in the business, with nothing of value to show but digitized memories of the many well crafted pieces of marketing propaganda, I feel like a fool and a fraud. I'm trying to figure out how to take my skillset and apply them to something new but it all comes down to manipulation and coercion (although this year we worked on the Sanders presidential campaign and that felt good.)
2381	Once I saw the news describe him as a "YouTube star", I knew something stupid like this was going on.

2386	A* for that essay, *ese*	You're right about the press wanting validation for the premier league being the best but you've also misunderstood what/why they mean. They (mostly) don't think Barca would struggle in the premier league, they don't say the premier league has the best teams or players, everyone knows Spain does. Even with some world class players in England, Spain has Messi, Ronaldo, etc. It's clear. That's why they push the angle of most competitive and most exciting, that's why they say stupid things like 'welcome to the premier league' when someone hits the crossbar or 'that's a premier league cross'. These are people working for Sky, they need to sell the premier league so people will buy sky to watch it, they need to hype it up. They don't say the Premier league is the best because it has the best teams but because it is more exciting and more competitive. Of course they exaggerate, but why wouldn't they, they are trying to sell it. However you could argue that they have a point regarding competitiveness but it doesn't matter, it isn't for you or me. I support Liverpool and live in England so I'm going to watch the premier league regardless, another person may live in Spain and support Barca so they are going go watch La Liga regardless of whether Garry Nevilla thinks the premier league is the best league. But tons of people especially in countries like America or India, it is meant to appeal to them. It's just advertising, it's no big deal so I don't know why people on Reddit make it a big deal. But the main thing I was trying to say is that they aren't saying Barca will struggle they've moved on from the premier league has the best quality teams advertising to the premier league is the best because of competition advertising.
2387	Bbbbbuuuuuttttttt they have degrees!	Lol at them thinking they are better. Get paid the same. And if things are so much better on the outside why don't these narcissists get out. Something tells me there's a lot better band geeks on the outside.
2388	Can get you president.	Yep. That's right. Everyone who disagrees with you must be an inhuman, sociopathic monster. That's a really great attitude and must get you really far in life.

2390	Does consuming electrolytes break the fast?	I fucking love IF plus keto. My window varies day to day but is anywhere from 16/8 to 20/4. It was an easy transition for me as well, and it's been about 6 months or so? It helps me stick to my calorie goals (1300 calories) as I have a slow metabolism from pcos and I'm only 5'3 (even despite lifting and nursing a baby). I think for me it's definitely hormone dependent. I've found that at some points in my cycle I can easily fast 20 hours, and others I'm starving before I make it to 16. Adding in broth or electrolyte water help. But I try not to stress if I break the fast early. Check out r/intermittentfasting for more info! There are a bunch of different kinds of fasting there as well.
2391	Wouldn't want to looks like a "mentally ill person," because they're all aggressive and spooky right?	learn how to do a bit of sewing and fix them up yourself. that's a skill that you'll use the rest of your life and it isn't that hard and you'll never have poor fitting clothes again. you'll look and feel much better about yourself not looking like a homeless person or mentally ill person. that's the immediate thought that comes to mind when i see someone with poor fitting clothes

Then you have the true believers who think the world will cater to their peculiarities and wont be able to find jobs. There is one specific one that dresses up as a cat (tail, ears and make up) and she actually thinks people will hire her and allow her to continue to wear it but complains she never gets interviews anywhere.

2427	"Men are such dicks" said no woman ever...	The immediate distinction that I see is that if I'm calling someone a dick, I'm deliberately insulting that particular person. Whereas if I'm referring to women in general as 'vaginas,' I'm reducing half the population to their genitalia. Gendered insults are an issue worth discussing in general, but I don't think that's the most significant thing going on here.
2428	of course, white people corrupted this poor black man and turned him into an uncle tom	Does Hillary still think white people are to blame for this police shooting? Even though the officer was black? Probably.

2451	Actually, laughing about helping a rapist isn't really funny no matter what the context is.	When you don't have hundreds of experiences dealing with something like that, it sounds horrifying, when you deal with it all the time you have to find some amount of humor in it or you'll go mad. Soldiers, paramedics, firefighters, doctors, so on and so forth, people who had to deal with gruesome or traumatic experiences will take on a form of humor that when taken out of context might be shocking, but it's an important coping mechanism for them.

2473	Donkey Kong Country Returns Returns + Metroid Prime Pinball 69	REMINDER: Retro Studios is still working on something. Nintendo said they believed they could handle two games at a time. We might get two Retro Studios announcements in January! I've watched a few prediction videos and they all seem to be forgetting about Retro with the surge of Switch information.
2474	I didn't expect the #StopThePot campaign to work so fast	Poll: Donald Trump Closing the Gap in Colorado - Breitbart
2475	Perhaps they should of build the line on the border with the Netherlands	The Maginot Line and the state of the French government/military leading up to WWII springs to mind.

2478	Two years sounds a bit lenient for stomping an underage teenager's head into the street.	Damn that article is an infuriating read.
2479	How does that make more sense?	Someone else pointed out that theyre probably sticking Indians with Asians. It makes a lot more sense when you think of it that way
2480	I think he just signed a contract this year.	"rumors hes retiring after this season" but he looks great out there
2481	Aint nobody gonna press pickle on my turf	Could just be Butters trying to squeeze in on his turf.
2482	Exactly, my 1.21 terrahertz can do a whole 5 calculations a minute with its 3 transistors!	That's clearly a lie - bigger is better, everyone knows that!
2483	This is going nowhere already	Nope, only your replies are offtopic. I'm perfectly civil, you're the only one putting a tone to this. You can put your crap elsewhere where people will buy it.
2484	I would be ok with it if he sat out this game as well.	Well that's not too bad. I expected MCL like Wilson. But if he has to miss the 49ers game then I think we can manage without him
2485	yet another reason to get VR	Yup. In VR, too.
2486	Ok aye thatd be a bit of a solution.	It's vr, just give guns to everyone!
2487	nope and nope	About activating an iPhone 4 I am about to buy an iPhone 4 that is locked to Vodafone UK. I am in Hungary, and can in no way obtain a Vodafone UK SIM card. Is it possible to activate it using a Vodafone HU SIM card, or does some kind of Hacktivation method exist these days ? (Side note: I am not intending to use it as a phone. I don't want the GSM features.)

2493	But they are both the same	I expect most Republican congressmen to fight against paid sick leave. Most Democratic congressmen should favor it.
2494	Could be chownow orders	Thanks, now I feel bad since the customer decided to leave my tip "pending" indefinitely ... Or instantly tip me $0.00. BTW, I delivered $60 worth of food in an upper class neighborhood, tip was an instant zero. I even think I delivered to them before,but I don't remember if they tipped me or left it pending for a long time so I wouldn't remember...
2495	He is in the conversation.	He's being robbed of proper recognition. To say ryan is not in the mvp conversation at this point is just foolish.
2496	Women that aren't smaller than me, das' about it	Men of Reddit. Being as honest as possible, what body structure, sizes and features do you find to be the most attractive about women, and what are your preferences?
2497	oh sorry forgot to update, I GOT ONE stole it from my friend's office mine also ran out	For real? Damn, that's rough. Yeah, after all that event, I don't think anyone would just give away that final published paper. Have you tried widespread search from the nearest to the closest shop?

2501	I mean it doesn't look like it went through the other side of the turret so technically it didn't go all the way through	Great photo. This is perforation, though. Penetration is when it doesn't go all the way through.
2502	I assume camping him so he tilts into oblivion, and singlehandedly loses the game	What exactly is the "hashinshin tactic"?
2503	Google her name and check her deviant art.	Sauce?
2504	"Your stuff is stuff and other peoples stuff is shit"	That reminds me of another George Carlin quote. He said everyone who drives slower than you is an idiot and everyone who drives faster than you is a maniac.
2505	I think you dropped this, take it	measles is mild, don't freak out. My son was not vaccinated and is so much healthier than vaccinated kids its ridiculous /
2506	Quality post	Queue at the Etihad before the CL game
2507	I know a nag whos an out side chance but is sure to get up :)	I want some info on buying AMD stock I really bump my head, I was tinkering for so long to buy amd stock when it was low but never tried to take a leap of faith. I am pretty young but got some money to spend like 2000, is it wise to invest? Pros and cons are appreciated
2508	Oh shit!, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonnnna...	Well the last few seconds would be terrifying knowing you're gonna die, but that was pretty quick and painless
2509	All you need is the set-up, Buford, and you'd have a *whole* joke.	Just needs the other 70% of the joke and this could be funny.
2510	tablet is worth too much pp peppy my man	Angelsim is the only player who has made a 700pp play without using tablet.
2511	Strategic FPS games with short TTK usually don't randomly respawn you behind your enemy a few short seconds after you die	his logic is a bit off, the most realistic FPS games have incredibly short TTK... like one bullet, and tend to involve the MOST strategy because of it.
2512	He is objectively bad though vs anyone level 30.	I don't think there's ever been a point where Anubis has been the *worst* god in the game. He's always been low-tier in high level play because of his nature as a pubstomp god, but he's never been as objectively bad as Sylvanus before the recent buffs or Ratotaskr before his rework.
2513	Both trees and god approve of capitalism them	Actually trees are competitive as fuck. Whichever grows fastest wins. Anything under its canopy can go fuck itself and become fertilizer.

2515	I've only seen one mention of that sad-looking Crimea there.	Europe according to the Danes
2516	Do I hear three?	sure he can. What would the press do? Write an op-ed? Two op-eds?
2517	"Future historically speaking" Wat	Last one broke the rules so these shouldn't. Guy has 200+ pictures of him quoting himself as well as these gems.
2518	One out of those five was a win and two he was only on as a sub, also bagged himself an assist, makes perfect sense to me	You know whats a good choice. A guy who has made 5 appearances for a team who are sitting 2nd last in the Championship.
2519	so tragically die?	Red Bull owner Mateschitz: Verstappen could become the next Senna.
2520	or the fact that there's not a decent payback system	Or the fact that a shit load of people never make enough money to compensate a college degree
2521	they should remake the conquest map with a japanese theme, so now every pantheon had a map representing it	I just want a new Conquest map. Like, I don't care if the functionality is any different, keep it physically the same for all I care, just give it a visual makeover. The same map has gotten boring after two years. Also something something buff Aphro, Chan'ge and Hel.
2522	the lovely prairies	Where in our beautiful country do the people call it Timmy Ho Ho's - so that I may avoid it forever
2523	Not that I like Pence, but Tim Kaine's kind of a nutbag though.	I was fine with Clinton winning because if she was impeached we wouldn't get either as president.
2524	Yeah guys, this guy is real enlightened.	This is it. Democracy fails when the masses are this uneducated.
2525	We're better off waiting for next gen so there will be mass adoption software for it too.	I hope the Rift gets some add on hardware from 3rd parties for face tracking and eye tracking. There's already an add-in eye tracker for the vive but it's expensive iirc. Probably small scale manufacturing = high cost. Someday tho
2526	Nothing says "We want to be taken seriously and our issues to be taken into consideration" like acting like animals.	Protesters demanding free education throw excrement at South African university
2527	Was probably hoping a woman would enter	At my gym we only have bathrooms, no real locker rooms. The lockers are just towards the back of the gym. So since I go lift after work, I usually change in the bathroom. (It's a single person bathroom) So I walk in and some guy is in there finishing up pissing. He got all mad like "WTF bro! KNOCK." Which, I don't blame him for. However, there's a lock on the door and it WORKS. IF THERE'S A LOCK WHY WOULDN'T YOU USE IT? YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO WATCH YOU PEE, I DON'T WANT TO WATCH YOU PEE, LOCK THE DOOR.
2528	fates is wasted potential: the game	1. Fair 2. Which is what annoys me --- it's a little on the side with potential!
2529	Me 2	I agree
2530	She got through the primary debates fine, and that was only a few months ago.	They are gonna have to pump her full of so many drugs to be able to get through the debates... She might as well just blow down lines of coke on the stage
2531	Obviously we should have elected a stubborn megalomaniac to work with the ones that other countries elect.	How does one prepare to deal with these clowns exactly?
2532	Send me your modlist!	Lets Take A moment to appreciate what the modern PC and Artist can achieve.
2533	Barrett Vest.	Whats your other yellow?
2534	*based dolphin reppin da naysh*	This Dolphin
2535	I assume a new mod pack will be able to use ARP ships there, you can use ARP ships in any port with the mod in Aslains/any mod pack that gets you access to all ports.	Nice. Oh but it's inconvenient to use anything but Yokosuka if I wanna play all my ships...
2536	I had something similar happen when i tried to start a trade while another civ tried to start a conversation with me (I was trying to start the trade while the ai was taking its turn)	Weird. I know that's one permutation of the bug--you can be declared on by an AI you haven't met, in which case it uses your leader, but this is strange.
2537	Can confirm, have FX-6350 and am delusional.	Could be worse, you could be delusional about an FX CPU instead. :)
2538	Did somebody tell them that Clinton lost the election?	Tens of thousands plan women's march on Washington
2539	Imagine if this was how Flash "time-travelled" to Bruce...	Just freehanded this on Microsoft Paint to show the true potential of Cyborg and Flash's friendship

2542	I always thought Wallonie was just a giant wine center.	Wallonia is half of Belgium, French Guiana is just a giant space centre.

2544	I married one- Melania T	Bby, get yourself a sugar daddy too.
2545	It is tacky, and pretty cringey too	Ugh, really? That's kinda tacky.
2546	LOL whoops, i thought Karius was the Leicester keeper haha sorry.	All from Liverpool?!
2547	I guess you can never win	Omg you're saying we have different skin tones? Racist.

2549	The Looker recruitment has become pretty standard	Moon story spoiler below Creepy how they make you join the police after becoming champion.
2550	Took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize who that was and that the comment wasn't "Because [the RHAP/reddit community is] heartless jerks"	Because we're heartless jerks.
2551	Mine is red and black	Wait, what? Do they come in other colors?
2552	He has probably never broken a glass or a phone dropping it from the table.	I know they are superhuman, but I still can't get over how quick and accurate Kimi's little sidestep is.
2553	I'm not sure you know what imminent means.	Juan Mata
2554	Disa also allows you to get FB messages and reply to them with most of the messenger functionality.	Tinfoil doesn't seem to waste any battery power when not in use. I've used it for about 3 years, and am very happy with its performance. Of course, I had to give in months ago and install Messenger, but I selectively take away permissions from it, which seems to help.
2555	True, but it's a more reasonable response than he came up with, I cringed when I read it.	That doesn't ever really prevent subsequent questions, in my experience.
2556	It's 2016 and I've never come across this magnificent post, wtf this is amazing	None pizza left beef made me lose my fucking shit.
2557	Yes, because its easier for him to make the market stop rather than gift one to himself	EA producers cheating? Did you also guys notice that as soon as king batty posted on twitter that he "finally got impact thiago" that player suddenly disappeared from market. On my server there are no longer any impact thiago's and until his tweet, we were able to find one at least every 10 minutes. Of course someone would quickly buy him but at least he was there. I have feeling that producers are sometimes just trying to make game good for themselves and trying to be better than us. Its probably unfair but thats how it works. Its almost impossible that this is not on purpose. And I also heard other people complaining about that too
2558	"Either we fuckin, or I'm fuckin..." ~Bill Cosby	You're mixed up. Bill Cosby never heard "I'm dtf", that was the whole problem.
2559	No, they just play the second one for the otk	Very strong vs. Anyfin pally

2565	Backdrop looks fake.. or is that my phone.	Girl has super supportive yoga coach
2566	Why a "whole turning head" for a man?	For woman : no hair at all on the body. For man : A whole turning head.
2567	Oh boy.	META: The Mods today. Censored.
2568	Never got any.... Please send some :-)	Have you ever gotten a pm, if so what was it about?
2569	Gee, who would have thought that 24/7 anti-Trump media bashing would cause people in the real world to react.	Ivanka Trump 'aggressively confronted by man on JetBlue while sitting with her children who screams that her father is ruining this country and asks why she is on his flight'
2570	I'm still not sure where they got that information, but Juvia's stuff is 100% not the same formula as the Morphe stuff.	Wow really? After the post a few months ago about Juvia's palettes were the exact formula as Morphe I thought it was going to be a blast. What's the cons?
2571	12.7.1?	Not for me. I got a new Beta today and still have the funky links.
2572	Why you goddamn antisemitic bastard!	Did you know the Leader of the American Nazi Party was Jewish?
2573	this pokecheese guy is pretty unique, but miis carry that person tbh	Wow! A mii swordfighter? In a Guest1111 region? That swordfighter player must be incredibly skilled and also super cool
2574	Not the sex icon we want speak for yourself	Not the sex icon we want, just the one we need right now
2575	Thanks Obama	To the lady who blames Trump's potential Treasury Secretary for taking her house
2576	Looks like a pretty good deal though I might order a couple for myself	Ok...
2577	Yeah why no X99 1080 SLI what a peasant	i3? sad day.
2578	Oh, I'm sure they do believe that	According to the protesting natives it is Energy Transfer Partners that is trespassing on native land and the protesters were invited to help them raise awareness of the disputed claims on the land.
2579	Probably liberal shills trying to make Trump look bad.	Sounds like they were just protesting.
2580	Lmao!	I've found there are two places in life where you can find examples of the worst humanity has to offer. One is at Walmart on Black Friday, and the other is Neverwinter PVP.
2581	Here, you dropped this:	Stop assuming that pizzagate is "fake news" and James Alifantis is just some regular human being that is into bdsm. Mainstream media is bought and paid by the elite jewish bankers who have an agenda to keep the sheeple asleep.
2582	But if we ban all the racists then there's no one left to challenge my views so I don't think this applies.	"When I challenge someone else's view, it's open and engaged discourse. But when other people challenge mine, they're just entrenching ideological convictions through group think. Self is other, but other is not self."
2583	Here, you forgot this:	Let's lower the gas tax to stimulate the driving economy. The increased taxes created by the stimulated economy will more than pay for the road improvements.
2584	Don't you mean November 29th.	He's a complete failure in business, just like he is in politics. Watching his horrible racist supporters cry on Novemeber 9th will be the greatest thing ever.
2585	And so has our President Elect	I think its about time our next president once he is sworn in take a serious look into our intelligence community. Personally I think that the CIA has been compromised.
2586	Post is removed: WC not in the title tag	Stock pixel on 6P
2587	Yeah, i'm not sure what someone posting here could find cringe worthy about the QSL card.	Honestly I think it's well done and rather slick looking.
2588	Top notch	People complain that FFXV's world is so barren. You know what world really is barren? Earth! Some places are just boring stretches of land for miles around. You go lookin around for stuff to do and things to find and there's just miles of the same boring stuff. Even the towns all the look the same. Same shops, same things to buy. You have to go an entire continent over it seems like to see anything different. Earth, man. What a boring open world!
2589	Lib Cuck	My kids ain't playing football lol
2590	No DaZeD is	Is Stanislaw currently NA's best IGL? OpTic is showing very methodical, coordinated play currently. While they may not be the most strat-heavy team, they certainly have a edge tactically over other teams in NA. As well, he is one of NA's few IGL's who can frag decently as well. Despite not being a star, he can clutch and hold his own in top play.
2591	None of that's going to matter when we're all dead because of nuclear fallout.	You do realize that some of us are of the "Bandaid Party" -- We KNEW that they were both fucked - but we voted for trump to tear the bandaid of "HOLY SHIT THIS SYSTEM IS FUCKED" off as quickly as possible... we didnt want HRC to profit, we would prefer that Trump just failed as disastrously as possible as quickly as possible such that we can get on with the world? You do know there is a large population of us out there don't you?
2592	Time to spend another high-round pick on a receiver then!	Everyone is ripping the entire team, but Kearse specifically, because we paid him big money (much to many peoples chagrin) and he is not playing it up at all this season. 7 targets, 1 reception this game.
2593	and everyone says, littering hurts the environment.	This hermit crab is using a baby food jar as his protective shell.
2594	Which one there's a bunch of reposts.	Link on 9gag?
2595	What's a healthy back?	So I've been starting Forte as my RB2 all season and have stashed Powell for just this reason. I'm going to start Powell this week no matter what I hear about Forte's MRI results. I have to go with the healthy back in the conference championship game.

It's really hard for me to find whole albums I really like or love. It hasn't happen in a while. But music I found recently this year I really like were Halsey's album Bad Lands and 21 Pilots album Blurry Face. What were some of your favourites? Recommendations would be nice. I love all music!

2613	No, the Lebanese part of me dissents from the American part	*descent
2614	Winning driver gets added weight in their car next year.	You can make one rule change in 2017 - what is it? For me, I'd probably go for swapping DRS with a push to pass system that can only be used X number of times. Apparently these cars are going to be difficult to overtake next year, and if that is true, then its likely we're going to see even more dependency on DRS. I don't know about you, but I'd rather see a Trulli train that results in a driver having to make a ballsy move in a corner, rather than just breezing through on the straight. What about you?
2615	That's the spirit	I'm American and I don't give a shit.

2625	9/12 treyarch will release hints for ee.	Could 9:12 mean September 12th? Long shot and i have never posted before , but could a hint be released on that date ? Maybe something could be unlocked on that date that can help us solve this EE. Just a thought
2626	Thanks for the suggestion	Florida. ~~Plz don't come to my house and kill me.~~
2627	Found the psychopath exec.	I took a few of their courses a while back. It's not so nefarious as people describe. It's certainly not a cult. People will call anything that you pay money to participate in a cult. It made a pretty big difference in my life, and I use things I learned there every day.
2628	Wouldn't want to offend all those people on death row, they already suffered so much.	I feel that being banned from most of the professional CS:GO is not comparable to death sentence. In my opinion comparison is in bad taste.

Can't wait until Hillary starts bombing Damascus. It's been years since America bombed a new Mideast capital. We need more death.

2635	Its almost like she was meant to catch survivors using her teleports only	she actually can't catch someone without blink now. Horrible time for nurse
2636	Americans usually say "out and about", while Canadians tend to say "out and about"	Canadians, how do you say "out and about"?
2637	Cause it's a good game :)	Battlerite hits 10k concurrent players!
2638	Subroza so I can wallhack and no one will know	If you could have any pro player's skill, whose would you want and why? Just curious what you guys think :^)
2639	That's exactly what I said would happen	And when you are told what they are saying. I can also see "that's a salad when I scan for help"
2640	Let's fork the OpenJDK, how hard can it be!	The problem with Java is not the language, but virtual machine. Kotlin does not have one.
2641	(Shh... Bernie is the Reddit buzzword, Ron Paul was a dirty "Republican" surely Bernie knows better!)	You are talking about Ron Paul right?
2642	I'd grind his wife and children as well, and give it to their parents as food.	Without feeling too bad about it? I think I'd feel pretty good about it, people who abuse animals are the scum of the earth, imagine killing something that probably had so much trust in you, it can't speak but he'll always be there for you, had a bad day? guess who comes running up to see if you're okay, he can't express it in words but he is a man's bes... okay im getting into it, but fuck animal abusers, seriously dude

2646	Will you marry me?	Don't do it. Be free!
2647	You forgot something, take it:	I know this picture is dated, but you can just tell that she would be into me. I'm different than most guys, a girl like that would pick up on it pretty quickly.
2648	It's been a really slow news day.	Soooooo..... Anything important happen today?
2649	This title violates rule 4	Majestic as f*ck
2650	Clearly the beginning of the word diet is in the word diabetes so it has to be related	Just like my cousin who insists I am going to give myself diabetes if I don't cut diet soda out of my diet. Uhh, no.
2651	Bust.	What a selfish player, scoring all the goals for the team ... Trade him already
2652	It's 2 minutes, cuz the slew footing cancels the boarding, and the instigating cancels out the unsportsmanlike	My buddy and I lost it when they gave him a 2 minute for roughing. That's got to be a suspension. 3 game?
2653	Dash cooldown resets after a kill.	Wait how do you dash so fast?!? Is there no cooldown if you get a hit? Have I been using genii wrong?
2654	OP might just have found some compelling evidence trump has less than half a brain.	TIL a girl who had half of her brain removed at age 8 grew up to earn a Master's degree and become a speech pathologist
2655	oops,	Not really, unless she's fat or something else that she did to herself. If someone's just ugly it's not like they wasted anything because they had nothing to start with.
2656	Parting of the Red Tees	You're right, not all student sections are created equally
2657	I never saw it so I guess I'm either OP in my sleep or just so good that I post good comments everytime!	This is reposted every other day and the fact that there are comments on this and people not calling it out makes me think they are different accounts of the same person just reposting the comments from the parent post that was successful.
2658	yep, that's an active sub	r/Guildwars2funny material there.
2659	They would demand his birth certificate	Jesus probably would have run for president.

2663	NOW WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?	If they were smart they would get rid of the damn caps lock key, not escape.
2664	Well you can tell it's a scam, the person being cuffed is white!	Anyone else receive this bizarre police magazine in the mail, with the horrible choice of cover image? Anyway, it's a scam - not official Ottawa Police publication
2665	Riverslime	Nah mate, the 73 is that shit that goes alongside the 405 and 5 between Newport and Ladera Ranch. You're thinking of the 261 and 241, which lead to the 91, which leads to suicide because after five hours of being on that road and only going a mile you'll fucking kill yourself just to spite all the people who decided Riverside needed to exist.
2666	Could be...	It doesn't have to mean that book is shorter. Maybe it's just different font size or something else like that.
2667	Go to twitter and search for "stonetear".	Did I miss something? Why is the reddit dom a better investigator than the FBI?
2668	Just saying, some automoderator may be autodetecting Karen any post with Karen in it.	But this wasn't a "Karen post," it just happened to involve her.
2669	Pls laugh	Jeb made us laugh.
2670	Thanks for the support!	Hang in there rams fans. Just hope Goff makes it through.
2671	Yep, that's what I do, click auto and then slide the sliders a bit to get it just right.	GIMP has an auto-white balance that works well enough in my opinion (if it has a good solid white background). For something that only takes a few seconds to do, it makes a good difference.
2672	And 'member the Mongolians?	Member "They killed Kenny! You, bastards!". Oh and member, member pip?? I member!
2673	Carolina Crazy Cat Ladies	We're up to 8 cats now. Going for the most statues instead of the biggest.

2675	Nic Cage can still surprise with good roles, I would put him above Travolta these days	Travolta has the same star power as Nic Cage or Steven Seagal. At this point, you take what you can get.
2676	when you're good, you're good, but when you're bad, you get a serious STD	He should come up here and fuck me in he ass hole

2682	I didn't vote for Trump	I really don't care about your dubious reasons for voting for Trump.
2683	Hope you've been witholding rent until this is all sorted out.	The building is 150 years old. The landlord I suppose was negligent over the years keeping up the infrastructure. The city caught on and shut down everything, pending an update to the pipes etc. There's been a bit of a standoff between the tenants and the landlord over the whole thing. Hot water was restored after 4 months or so, but still no cooking or heating gas. That's supposed to be remedied by Oct 1. Construction is ongoing. After that, I suppose there will be some legal battles over rent money due or not due...
2684	DAE America sucks, throw off our facist overlords and embrace true communism.	This is hung up at work...just a nice, patriotic quilt square...right?
2685	Hokuto no Ken needs some recognition nowadays	What anime do you wish had as much popularity as Naruto and etc? I felt that Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari didn't have as much popularity. Maybe it is due to many people giving up on this season of anime. There wasn't many good ones. But Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari is a really cute one. The animation is really beautiful and it always touches your heart.
2686	Thanks for that	Hamilton won the championship in 2008 in the final corner of the final race after passing Timo Glock, who looked like he was going slower than usual. This lead to people conspiring that Glock slowed down on purpose to let Hamilton passed, and therefore let him win the championship, he really slowed down because it'd been a mixed conditions race, and he was still on the wrong compound of tyres.

2688	5 looks sick as fuck	Service medals 2017 all levels
2689	Well, since the pile of shit will end up in jail, it looks like you're getting Trump	It'd hard not to be positive about Clinton when trump is the alternative. I would literally vote for a pile of shit on the floor before voting for trump.
2690	You mean *WING*	especially when you brief on a monthly basis to an entirr squadron NOT to drink and drive. the fuck.
2691	the spinbotter most likely won't go into overwatch if he knows what he is doing.	He's somebody else's job.
2692	Based on his cabinet picks I don't think we should expect anything but a radical right agenda from this administration.	You are right there is a fight to be fought and it has to be. I'm just very pessimistic because those people have already believed Republican propaganda for decades. In fact to such an extent that democrats got in bed with corporate interests so that they can compete. Its center-right and radical-right. There is no representation for the left. Trump is actually somewhere in the center IMO; if we pretend he was not lying about everything he wanted to do.
2693	Frogger and munchies!	What was your favorite computer game to play when you were younger?
2694	You do know you have to bathe reptiles or they get scale rot	Only someone raised far from animals would be unable to tell that the snake is in distress. Notice it is also in water. That's not an accident. People who aren't familiar with animals think animals are like humans. My old housemates asked me if we needed to leave all the lights on for my dog.
2695	Thanks for the answer, I was thinking the same, apply from here and then apply again when I relocate if I get no answers.	Whilst I don't know the specifics of your industry or the economic market around your industry right now, what I would say is this: Since it seems there are no obvious detrements to applying for a job before you move, and since you can just apply again after you move, I imagine it would only be logical to apply for jobs now anyway, since it potentially gives you a higher chance of getting one, and it's pretty much risk free. The only caveat to this is if applying for jobs now could potentially damage your chances of getting a job whilst over here, which I suppose it could if companies rejected you based on you not being in the uk, but if they weren't going to look at your cv because you weren't in the UK, I can't see any harm in re-applying once you're here. Either way I'd say it seems the most economically logical thing to do to start applying before you move.
2696	If this is the kind of stuff that people will forget in the span of a few weeks, that raises the question, is it as earth-shattering as he claims?	If he releases them now, it will be forgotten by the time of the election.
2697	He's like, "Not this bullshit again, for fucks sake."	Never realized how hilarious it is that Vader just straight up chokes one of his co workers for being a disrespectful little turd and making fun of his religion.
2698	Being able to do this is the reason they made drugs illegal.	or we could just legalize and regulate drugs
2699	It's been about half a decade since I was in a materials lab	You are correct, the indenter can be ceramic (usually its steel for hrb and softer ranges though). It's not always a ball though (Vickers and knoop tests use pyramid shaped indenters). Source: work in a materials R&amp;D lab
2700	Yeah, but after that the max you get like 800 tickets per round of the shooting game	I'm fairly sure I've collected 30k tickets just from random rolls scattered around the park.
2701	Terrelle Pryor and Bell - take it and run, Jordy is losing targets	**NEED IMMEDIATE OPINIONS TRADE MIGHT SLIP AWAY VERY QUICK** I give: Jordy Nelson and Todd Gurley I receive: Le'veon Bell and one of 4 receivers: Stefon Diggs, Jordan Matthews, Mike Wallace or Terelle Pryor. 12 man 0.5 PPR. My WRs are Brown, Nelson, Fuller, Hurns My RBs are Gurley, West, Ryan Mathews.
2702	Mind aswell give all the gods that have wings a passive or an ability they could use every now and then because well.. They have wings am I right ?	But this ruins her identity -- she has wings but can only fly sometimes? Why not just reduce the amount of time she can fly so she can only make it, say, to her t2 tower?
2703	Their power against siege lines is really nerfed in that patch with supply cost of the tempest going up and their anti ground range being halved	I feel like protoss already deals well enough verses a siege line already though. Protoss generally don't have trouble going up against straight up fight, whereas zerg gets blocked by pdd and wall offs
2704	:)	Wow, what are the odds?!
2705	Or hes trying to tell them to get on the fucking paylaod	Zen is usually zooming around because the team is all over the place and he wants to heal everyone up.
2706	._.	Cho'gall is great on paper, but with only Soul Siphon and Kara Kazham to use with his battlecry.... he's a little lacklustre
2707	"Everyone who has valid criticisms against the DLC is dumb because im a fanboy" Please leave	40% of people are just dumb. ToH is the only DLC that competes with it and as you've mentioned, ToH is actually 2 DLCs.
2708	I would sell my OP3 for a OP3 with a 2K IPS.	It makes sense if they will use an LCD rather than an OLED display, since the shortage of OLED displays is what's slowing down the OP3 shipping out. They may decide to launch a "refresh" model without that particular bottleneck to replace the OP3.
2709	I wish they actually made the movie with Tom Cruise (and related cast) after the original with Michael Mayer.	Tom Cruise is Austin Power
2710	Yes, these jokes are always just hilarious and never get old.	I'm pretty sure the average Texan can't identify any of the objects in that map.
2711	No, you're "punished" because you're not working with your team	Criticism: BF1 individual uncontested capture times are too slow. I am playing the objective and getting punished with boredom and an opportunity to get out flanked.
2712	Well, there is always the rampant voter fraud from ACORN and whatever to make up the difference.	Imagine Trump winning the election because of SEPTA..
2713	We Hearthstone now	There should be premium skins. There should not be ten-dollar premium skins.
2714	It's more like keying your GF's car that you paid for I guess.	Why would you beat your wife? That is like keying your own car.
2715	Fearing your own connationals usually ends poorly.	This is an odd time where you may be excused to fear your fellow American.
2716	I'd get ready for beer pong with Hitler	How would you react if you was in hell but turned out to be great beer,women,sex and football?
2717	Dance bitches.	How foolish for Hollywood to think their actors were important enough to be able to influence democracy. Get back to entertaining us.
2718	Guy writes an article in the Huffpo underhis real name with a photo of his face with his girlfriend.... these chasers are getting clever amirite	Uh... no? Chasers are creepy fucks who are on our side as far as they can get their rocks off to us.
2719	All white socks ladies and gentlemen	First time stepping outside in my new UBs and this happened :(
2720	lol, the media has always been controlled by (((those with a liberal bias)))	Don't verify. Just get it out there, spread it around. Once Trump supporters have heard it, it no longer matters how many times it's debunked; that's just the lying (((liberal media))). Duffy gets the spirit of the Trump campaign.
2721	Large organization that uses fear for political gain == terrorism.	It is easy to frighten people who don't know the facts, so easy that an entire political party uses fear in place of policies.
2722	Going online	I'm free if you're still available. =)
2723	I wouldn't say anyone attacks each other, just that the general opinions on beauty brands switches quickly	I'm going to disagree. People often don't attack each other for liking a brand others dislike. Like JS, people still are able to discuss his products.
2724	You dropped your	This is great news, Canada just needs its own Trump now
2725	I cringe when I see him walk, sit, daydream...pretty much any time he or his current story comes up.	I cringe every time that doctor goes after carls dick
2726	If it gets there, I am buying a dozen houses.	2008 the American housing crisis caused house prices to drop about 30%. And you want it to drop more than 2x that. Not only would that be the greatest drop in North American history it would cause our economy to be destroyed and crippled. The government would step in way before. There's no way that happens.
2727	I'd rather die knowing i did the right thing than live knowing i didn't.	He couldn't do anything since the people said not to help him because he might have some kind of disease.
2728	It would be nice if we had an example of a recent Republican president enacting a very similar economic plan, only for it to fail miserably.	yeah, the tax cuts for billionaires is a waste.
2729	he said reduction not removal	You still need the damage increase or else Ana's ult is just a glorified Lucio boost, but you are right. The damage and speed boost are the legs of her ult. Remove one or the other and the ult collapses. The increase in damage resistance is what makes her ult over-the-top.
2730	No way, millennials are what's wrong with everything.	Blame the people who manufactured and came up with the idea for participation trophies. I assume they were the adults in the room.

2739	My girlfriend works at a gym and told me there a is a guy cussing to himself while on the treadmill and loudly proclaiming trump is an 'ugly mother fucker who doesn't understand that Russia will attack us'	The way the left freaks out about Trump wanting to get along with Putin is crazy Listening to Matt Lauer tonight talk about how crazy it is that Trump wants to get along with Putin is honestly a bit worrying. They genuinely seem like they want to go to war with Russia. We need trump
2740	Year 2.	Eh, semantics. They're called season passes, not year passes.
2741	thank mr skkkeltal	Inside each of them they have a spooky skeleton
2742	Yea, now they can't bring their weed or coke home.	I think they are also shitting themselves because they now have to go through heavy security screening to get into the building or just walk within blocks of it.

2746	Titanic	Favorite Little Known or International Drinking Games Hey, you filthy lushes, I have a favor to ask. I'm creating a work about drinking games and I'm looking for regional or international drinking games. What are your favorite games that aren't the staples (beer pong, flip cup, kings, etc)? Have you picked up any fun or strange games while traveling abroad? Is there a regional game you love but no one outside of Sheboygan, Wisconsin knows about it? If you don't know the name of the game but know how to play, that's fine too. I appreciate all the help, you beautiful drunkards. Cheers!
2747	Yup I think this is how I got burnt out in the first place	Sit back and have a beer. Enjoy the dead time. No need to keep going at 100% between semesters.

2756	It is a quote from the OP page link.	What is marginally better? The display? It's way better. Twice the peak brightness, way better color accuracy (grey scale, white points, etc.), better performance in sunlight and more. As for the rest of the hardware, the S7 crushes it (and generally any other design). Better bezels, thinner and more beautiful design, waterproof, SD support, better camera, better battery time, etc. The S7 is inferior to the Pixel, but only because of the obviously inferior software (the single most important aspect of a phone). In terms of hardware and design, there's really no competition here.

2776	Billions will die that's a fact nobody talks about, nobody lives forever	Yes but in the end the planet will continue to warm and humanity will suffer enormously and millions, maybe even billions of people will die. There isn't anything that anyone can do to prevent it. The children of those who prepare for the worst may live. So basically the warnings and the gloom and doom people are wasting their time. They should be preparing instead.

2803	Bit harsh language there, you speak like a dictator talking like that.	Is this a support group for banned people? I feel so ashamed and guilt ridden for the hurt I caused in r/latestagecapitalism
2804	Because being poor and lazy are the same thing	*Junk food cravings are triggered by laziness
2805	Thank you for that valuable source.	I did my thesis on this, and Dawkins and NDGT were particular targets. Both have been repeatedly and specifically dismissive of philosophy, while simultaneously making mistakes that first year philosophy students are expected not to make.
2806	Yeah, their broast is great but everything else there is suspiciously bad.	Have you guys tried Bait Al Faroj? Down on imam saud? They're not bad either.
2807	Bethesda needed another faction of bandits for their Skyrim mod	Was it ever explained in FO4 why the Gunners, a mercenary group, have a kill on sight policy for you specifically even if you've not done anything?
2808	The "no confederations for ai" mod helps tremendously.	The Endless Armies of the Woodelves i'm 217 turns into my Vampires campaign. i have a good chunk of territory. i'm also having to fight epic battles on a constant basis for every region. the wood elves have been a constant threat. i was so focused on them i almost didnt catch chaos and stop them from breaking Sylvania. i managed to get them to back off for the 5 turns i needed to break chaos, but a mere 10 turns after that they declared war again and dragged the dwarves into a fight with me too. thankfully the dwarves are still trying to end the greenskins and the empire is just trying to hold on to what it has. Still every 2 or 3 turns, 2 or 3 full stacks come marching up Blackfire pass and i get ready to fend them off once more. I dont mind the constant fighting, but no other race tries to attack me so often with so many armies. this cant be how the elves where intended to function. far as i can tell they are competing for badlands space with the dwarves and greenskins, mousillion has most of bretonnia under it control. i hope the bretonnians get enough of an upgrade to keep this leafy menance under control. if this is typical of the other 2 elf races the world will soon be ruled by the pointy ears once again.
2809	Its all good if you plan to rush B anyways	How could that Elite Crew squad not notice the Phoenix Connexion guy sneaking with them?
2810	I would but i only took that one photo, the look i was trying for was a bit of punk/rock	Really like the combination, though it's a bit difficult to get an idea of the overall look when you're sitting. Maybe include a pic of you standing as well?
2811	That's racist.	They look strangely similar to each other
2812	I can guarantee this edgelord hasn't seen his penis in a long time.	Just a 100% normal person wearing a 100% normal outfit
2813	But he said "speaks volumes"	Hey guys! We got an atheism elitist over here! Saying that someone is inferior because of their beliefs is incredibly short-sighted and immature.
2814	THIS IS WHY WE CANT HAVE NICE THINGS	90% sure they picked Willie beavers because of his name
2815	Wow, that's funny!	E
2816	Don't you dare call me that you asshole.	I appreciate your honesty, you mean, sad little man.
2817	$2 ones from dollar stores :)	Very true. Though I'm curious as to what sort of adapters you're using with regards to powering your PC.
2818	I've been eyeing milk paint for a nursery recently, what do you think?	What's for dinner. National politics. Low VOC interior paint. The usual.
2819	Let's remember the pulse night club shooter who killed 50 gays and hated gays was a Hillary supporter.	She was probably wrong to make such a blanket generalization. But let's remember that Trump's supporters include white supremacists, xenophobes, racists, sexists, homophobes... They're not all great people, or great Americans.
2820	you see that is why I always throw a McCree pocket sand out there	Who said Roadhog couldn't cross the Volskaya gap?
2821	Well you should tell that to the artist, not me, buddyman buddyboy.	My critique is, if you are going to do something simple, it needs to be perfect and tight. You colored the pattern wrong on the sides. Should be checkered like the top and bottom, also the corners aren't crispy at the bottom, and the U is unbalanced. If you don't keep it crispy minimalism doesn't work
2822	Downvoted for no Oxford comma	My three favourite games are Grand, Theft and Auto.
2823	Personal Request: Test if having a buddy with you makes you feel less lonely :'(	testing buddy system// what do you want me to test
2824	I might actually support a wall that is high enough to reach the stratosphere.	This is why we *need* Trump and Putin on the world stage. We need a wall to protect us from those aliens.
2825	What is the volume of cream?	I found this in the recipe file at work.
2826	Global warming is scam!	Nashvillian here -- January we had the single largest snowfall in Nashville history, 8.5". That's probably when it was filmed.
2827	Yah but Russia may have leaked the horrible things that the DNC attempted to hide from the public!	It's also very dangerous. Creating a boogie man out of your opponents is how you prep your country for war/genocide
2828	Not if he converts to gay from atheism.	I think it works the other way; disapproval goes over 100%.
2829	he must have sent his goons in to downvote you into oblivion	... and then there is DS
2830	Yeah, because you can walk into any store and find Meta Knight, D3, Ness and Wario.	Probably because they're not very rare anymore.
2831	Race Traitor!	White: hate mayonnaise
2832	Hey, it's not that bad if you throw down $60 dollars for the other half of the game!	And much of the content of the originals.
2833	Yeah but you still have white male privilege, so stop oppressing me!	I am the most unlucky white american I swear. One thing after another. Got a violation for weed last year, my mom pulled up just now as I was buying, and I opened at least 15 crates in rocket league, only to get normal shit. I mean, wow. I have a low RNG in everything.
2834	Yeah the GOP totally let Hillary skate by on Benghazi and E-mails!	Of course it is. Absolutely *everything* that can be done about any Republican candidates will be done. Anything and everything. People literally don't care about Hillary's Wall Street ties and her suspect Clinton Foundation tax status. (inb4 "Hillary has NOTHING to do with Trump and Christie, why are you mentioning it?). I am sure that Christie and every other republican has been *heavily* audited by the IRS every single year.
2835	Well, I *am* the smartest guy in this forum.	Unfortunately, redditors tend to think they know better than others with actual experience in the subject.
2836	We care not for the belief of men	Skyrimi is my favorite too! Us gamers, huh?
2837	Nah, 900k is so much man they're swimming in a pool made of money right now laughing at everyone	Why is anyone acting like this is big news? The goal was to show that there's more than enough interest to venture capitalists, and if they hit Star Citizen-level, they could cut out the VCs completely. They said this during the crowdfunding campaign.
2838	Our first goal against Anderlecht better have been scored by Anderson	And Zlatan scored the winning goal after having released his clothing brand called A-Z.
2839	Well aren't you just a ray of sunshine!	"Yes they are" Well that fucking settles it! You must have been captain of the debate team.
2840	black is the new silver	silver map textures aswell
2841	But she's a modern empowered woman	Taylor Swift. All her music is just "boohoo this person hurt me, let's start a bullying campaign against them". All of it. It's disgusting.
2842	at least it's organic.	"BP believes that allowing the oil to disperse naturally at sea is the best way to deal with the spill" I'm sure their cheap asses do.
2843	He made a great effort trying to tackle Rhodes	I don't think running a post route instead of a streak because you didn't hear your QB is giving up, but that's just me
2844	How dare a man bring up prostate cancer during breast cancer awareness month!	Ben Stiller Dying! Diagnosis - Prostate Cancer
2845	Little grls are my favorite	Sure, if you are into children like that. Otherwise it's really Ranger.
2846	Morrisey	Who would you like to see on a Brand New tribute cover album? With Brand New calling it quits in 2018 what bands/musicians would you like to see on a hypothetical tribute cover album?
2847	He's trying to oppress all the poor defenseless whites and create the black masterrace	An argument about why Obama is a nazi. The stupid was so painful.
2848	I think it's pretty obvious, Bill also sexually assaults women but he then goes to his private server at home and commands a drone strike on the woman	I'm trying to imagine what Bill could have said that was "far worse" and I honestly can't. Unless Bill Clinton is talking about making snuff films on the golf course.
2849	10 yards is also 3 feet!	Today, I was standing behind one of the registors when a customer asked the cashier if the tape rolls she had would be long enough to go around her posterboard, mind you she didn't have a poster board with her. She said she couldn't find the length of the tape anywhere on it, cashier takes a few seconds to look at, then points to where it says "5.xx yards." Customer then proceeds to say: "Well, 5 yards is 3 feet so that should be plenty, right?" I just face palmed internally and walked away.
2850	Be sure to mention cup size, that's *always* a sign of quality writing.	How would you refer to a woman's underwear in writing? Minding the context, I always found the word 'panties' to be awfully childish and I was wondering if any one else had a better alternative.
2851	What corruption?	DOJ Drops Case Against Alleged Arms Dealer to Libyan Rebels Amid Links to Hillary Clinton
2852	What does this to CJ Anderson's value?	Gary Kubiak OUT vs. Chargers
2853	"Just heal better then, nub"	I am incredibly bitter, but I've never felt the need to let somebody die out of that. Everybody lives, I will just give a passive aggressive "Rogue, next time, please /try/ to avoid pulling." message and get on with life after the boss.
2854	But society has kept telling me that all men are child molesters, how can we let them take care of children?	President Obama signs an act requiring baby changing stations to be available in men's restrooms
2855	Yes because that's exactly what I said	Soooo.... We can save more animals in Africa by shooting zoo Gorillas? Logic checks out.
2856	I thought the only thing happening in the world was Kim Kardashian being robbed and killer clowns?	they bother to cover actual news.
2857	Hopefully they force us into lfr	I guess the real issue will be where/how to collect the runes. DO you have to go back and do EN once NH is out? Or both? not sure
2858	found the manlet	I don't remember asking what your plans were for the weekend
2859	How else do you keep it from falling out of a warn out outlet?	All the ones I have are polarized on both ends though. Are people just using really old ones or.. mashing it in the wrong way?
2860	You forgot to add	Hell ya! Tranzit is one of the best maps, I hope they remaster it for a bonus map. Add gobble gum and new guns of course, and without that, get hit once and you stop running nonsense it would be the supreme ruler of the zombies map universe! lol
2861	Fuck him for getting injured, amirite?	Same boat, though he lost me that game when he got injured
2862	Sounds like Space Engine has more gameplay than E:D	It's the second post of him mixing ED and Space Engine together. Space Engine is a free, procedural universe simulator with no gameplay but stunning views.
2863	Only one black guy =/= diverse	Even just the protagonists have quite the variety. White American (Michael) White Canadian (Trevor) Black (Franklin) Chinese (Huang lee) Dominican (Luis) Jewish (Johnny klebitz) Eastern european (Niko) diversity where Before GTA 3 doesn't really count since your protagonist is usually a portrait of your choice and little else. No dialog, no anything. Even what's his face from 3 never talks. The only "lacking" is female protagonists, but of course there are no female protagonists. People freak out with every new installment because **there are women in the game you can choose to kill if you want to, but at no point are told to**. All soldiers are male, all antagonists you kill are male (to my knowledge). In order to kill a woman you have to go off the rails and do something that is more than likely to result in punishment (getting a wanted level). And yet, the fact that it's even an *option* is too much. Can you imagine the nuclear winter that would occur if GTA had a female protagonist and she actually did something bad? The sun would be blotted out for a thousand years by shrill harpies and white knights nodding respectfully toward them.
2864	But they are entrepreneurs!	I am sick of people calling that kind of crap "work." No, your Arbonne parties do not equal a job. You aren't "in business for yourself" because you sell $100 of Scentsy candles per month. My mom sold Avon so I know how that crap works (but she also worked a 9-5-- she mostly sold it so she could get free makeup).
2865	But...all of history is made out of atoms...therefore they actually know it better than everyone	Physicists need to shut up about philosophy and history more often.
2866	I think what people see regarding the DNC corruption is that there was a 2008 Clinton campaign co-chair running the 2016 primary and claiming the process was neutral until leaks occurred causing her to step down on the eve of the DNC convention and then immediately get brought on as an (honorary) co-chair of the same campaign she was seen to be in favor of.	So the DNC's corruption is also Hillary's because they like and support her? Sounds like guilt by association. And the media isn't completely uncritical of Hillary, just not as critical as some would like.
2867	Anyone would'v won 11 championships with Jordan, Pippen, Kobe, Shaq.	Phil Jackson won 11 championships, but now this generation thinks he was never a good coach, so you tell me.
2868	Yes but it is in their best interest to get you the highest salary, so unless they completely misrepresented the position's salary, it's the client you should be angry at.	They run communication between you an the clients.
2869	Blue is the Warmest Color	What's a great movie with a male and female lead where these characters don't wind up together?
2870	I just can't wait for the Christmas shows and movies on ABC and Cartoon Network!	What do you want for christmas?
2871	Controversy.	When you read the comment sections of different site, what exactly is it you're looking for?

2873	#HillaryDucksJustice	How many felonies does she have to commit before somebody that can do anything bothers to care?
2874	I think NoPromosTwitter is open source on GitHub	How would I go about adding features for the native Twitter App As the title says I want to add features to the native Twitter app and change some of the already existing features. How would I go about starting this?
2875	Just look at his history; we're talking several dozen per day.	It has probably worked for him once, so technically it should work again. Gotta give him props for sticking to his priorities! But yeah downvotes for him!
2876	It's also natural to club your neighbour over the head and steal their food, if you were broke and starving, doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.	We shouldn't dehumanize those that use the system either. They aren't so different from you and I. Given circumstances where you could turn your money into more money and protect your investments, you would by any means necessary. It's natural, we just have to keep up.
2877	I hear it's one of our finest remaining urban centers.	Welcome to City 17. It's safer here.
2878	Gallowboob	Reddit, who is idolised, but doesn't deserve it?
2879	You leave that ball of adorable alone!	That's a better choice that Pikasteel the Hedgehog though.
2880	You do realize by calling all democrats bigoted you're being a bigot lol	Typical leftist hypocrisy. 'My bigotry against you is justified because you're so bigoted.' All Democrats are bigots but some are more bigoted than others.
2881	Ok thank you.	Why would there be? No.
2882	Stitches is the only one I don't own and it seems I'm in no mood to be a hooker this week either.	Free-to-Play Hero Rotation: December 06 - December 13, 2016

2885	chew	duwang
2886	I heard there were large scale DDoS attacks on the datacenters in Chicago	Ping In NA I've been playing at a consistent ping(ms) if 23 since the NA server moved to Chicago. In just this last two weeks or so my ping has raised to a consistent 35 ping. It this because worlds is going on or did something happen? I've asked some people too and they say their ping is higher then what they used to average as well.
2887	Boy, judging by the comments, I'm glad I'm not Dez.	Sunday night thread brought to you by the 2017 Audi A3 Pricing out cars I could afford with the amount of money I've wasted on college
2888	I was gonna say... Trump has really not needed any help.	Umm this campaign was sinking already. Even the *possibility* of 4 years of Trump is worse than 8 years of W. I don't like counting my ducks before they hatch, but Billy might have redeemed the family name by delivering the final death blow.
2889	Fancy strip mall on one side and liquor stores and currency exchanges on the other?	I have no analogy for that one.
2890	What they're saying is that if you buy an annual pass right now, it will last until October 2018, which makes sense since why would you pay the price for 12 months if 2017 is free for everyone.	If I'm reading the article correctly, it's not that they are waiving the fees for everyone, it's that if you buy a pass in 2016, it lasts for 24 months instead of 12 months. So if you don't buy a pass in 2016, you'd still have to pay in 2017?
2891	But you don't understand, it is okay for them to hassle you because they *know* that God exists and they want to save you.	Change the words a bit, and many atheists feel the same way about being constantly hassled by Christians...
2892	Let alone the fact that it is an impossible act!	The phrase "pick yourself up by your bootstraps", which is more often than not uttered by people who have never had to deal with actual economic hardship.
2893	Pirlo first, 39 pace though, calhanoglu is 74 pac, 78 dri, 80 sho and pas, 41 def and 57 phy, pjanic is third	Can't see it right now but I imagine calhanoglu is top 3?
2894	I called in yesterday to ask, and they were not yet on display.	Are the new touch bar MacBook Pros in stores to play around with?
2895	Perhaps because it is not a clever word play or quip, rather just pointing out that the band coined the abbreviation and used it literally for the word "Ecstasy".	lol how is nobody else pointing this out?
2896	Wimpy?	I am trying to think of the word to describe this. The only word I can think of is "pathetic," but that sounds way meaner than what I'm thinking of. Whatever the word is, this made me give a sad chuckle.
2897	It doesnt invalidate a woman's opinion, but there are times emotions should not be used to make decisions	too bad this subreddit is over run with men who try to invalidate every womans opinions now. im not a fan of hilary but ever since she started running ive heard several guys mention that a womans not fit for president bc emotions. its so annoying and just another example of guys who think theyre better than women
2898	No it's not... Mby read the discription/explanation from GGG staff and stop making stupid assumptions.. If you hit at center you get to 87% effectiveness ffs...	Except in the middle, where it overlaps, where you are focusing your dps with 8+ aps. So what if it is 87% on the sides - way faster than the totem could ever be. Base totem placement speed is .5s cut down to .25s from the faster placement built in - but it still has a summon animation for the spirit and the delay based on attack speed before the first swing. In that amount of time you will have used Lacerate at least 2-3 times doing 170-240% weapon damage YES EVEN WITH THE 87%. Not to mention if you need to reposition the totem(s). So yes - Lacerate is in fact better subjectively and objectively than Warchief
2899	Then see: Jews In Space	See: McCarthyism
2900	So when you say "help" with your itinerary, what you mean is you want us to research and make it for you.	First timers in Montreal - need help with itinerary!
2901	He was also dubbed the highest paid athlete on Smackdown	If i remember correctly he was billed as one of the "hottest" free agents before his debut, he also had a lot of money so basically an "all star athlete"
2902	Don't forget the combat is fun and it is an educational rpg, you learn real Chemistry playing it!	This looks super interesting, although I couldn't care less about the music. It looks like a game about being an alchemist of some sort (watched the trailer), it goes on to my list of games to try out. Good find!

2904	Generally, there isn't singular and plural in Japanese.	I knew I screwed that up xD The thing is "sushis" is the plural form of "sushi" in French so I got used to it, and I figured it could take an s as it's not Italian or Latin. My bad, this one's on me.
2905	What are you going to do with all that extra cash?	Apparently I'm supposed to work even if I only have $25 take home pay a month after child care expenses. Yeah, okay.
2906	"Hey man, my name's Deacon."	What would lone wanderer think of your sole survivor? Like your character from f03 what would their opinion be about the sole survivor?
2907	Feeling	That
2908	Well yeah, but I ran out of options recently and I wanted to expand my "Music Pool" haha.	Just whatever you like? No?
2909	Fire... Fire is always the answer and even when it's not it destroys whatever the problem was so no answer is needed.	Couldn't think of a better place to post, but does anyone know how to remove these stickers?

2919	Early Pregnancy Test.	Matt's Twitter Handle I was digging around for information on "Matt Baier 2014" and noticed his Twitter handle at that time was: mattbEPT Does anyone know what that means? Because the first thing I thought was the brand of pregnancy tests! So appropriate for a serial fornicator!

2921	Now look at this plane, that I just stole	No, he was number 1.
2922	Sign the house over to him/her.	That's the problem. The city requires rental income or owner occupier. So how is the 18 year old son living in this house going to be treated?
2923	I guess this makes up for not allowing them into the Celestial Kingdom before 1978.	Mormon gift opens up a vast new path for African-American genealogical treasures
2924	I seriously doubt the Switch will be able to supply enough processing power for VR.	Nintendo Switch would be Nintendo's chance to create a VR headset Knowing that the Switch will be more powerful that the Wii U, Nintendo could make a VR headset, using the detachable controller pieces as the controller's for VR (provided that they are motion tracking). They only need a camera and a headset (and maybe new controllers)
2925	Ain't that a bitch lol	Oh my god yes I was terrified to say my worst fears out loud because I thought satan might make them come true but then I was afraid to think them cause jehovah might test me.
2926	Have you been flown on his plane to his private island to have a party with him?	I live next door to a convicted pedophile. That isn't a reflection on me. I've been to his house. If I ran for office and he gave me money I would accept it. He does make me feel icky though. That's all this story is, icky. There's no substance here it's just more speculation.
2927	How come every racist in America is voting for Trump?	Actually it doesn't. This guy is definitely in the minority. Stop listening to what Clinton and the media are feeding you and actually go out and meet Trump supporters. You'll be surprised.
2928	Chris Jones!	LP ladouceur

2940	RIP Comrade Ochs!	Happy Birthday Comrade Phil Ochs. Your insights about liberals remain as relevant as ever.
2941	Its not a penalty its a tax.	I never liked the fact that it was *forced* on people, that's a bunch of shit IMO. You should not be penalized for not buying something you don't want.
2942	How did you handle your taxes?	Divorce is a pain in the ass in most states and if she never planned on marrying again it really isn't a priority. My ex and I went through the same situation until I met my current wife who demanded I finish the job.
2943	Where's the FAMAS in this image?	Here's a drawing of Huskar. (mah boi)

I used to use Nui Hsing and another system to get rank VERY quickly. Dont know what to do now. Currently Ensign and looking to get a corvette.
2946	Can you change the last of it for Reddit Silver?	I'm almost out of Reddit gold, what should I do? I was guilded because I watched a video of a man bathing in shit and gave a graphic summary. Now the cycle is complete, and I return to shit for advice.

2951	That doesn't say much.	It's as much mental illness as being gay is, yeah.
2952	Well, aren't you a responsible gun owner	Your hands vs. my concealed carry weapon? Not likely.

2954	And Aretha Franklin.	Please, someone put Tom Waits in a bunker with a team of doctors, instruments, whiskey and cigarettes. Thank you.
2955	So Canadian English is also Australian English	Canadian English is closer to British English than American English. But Canadian English still has some Americanized spellings. Like -ize vs -ise. It's recognized in US/CA and recognised in UK*. *Complicated but don't wanna delve into it.
2956	Miss-issippi, Miss-ouri, miss-ion, miss-fit, miss-guided, shall I go on?	What words do people always miss-pronounce?
2957	By grabbing them by the pussy.	If you can't take a Stunner, how can you beat ISIS?
2958	Borderlands is going to be a real thing I guess.	The new and improved CSA, Corporate States of America.
2959	Obviously placing a gay men with a BBC fetish, in a cabinet supported by the KKK and including a homo-therapy believing religious fanatic would make for the most awesomest presidency ever.	I can't tell if that's meant to be a"oh Jesus Christ this is going to be a strange presidential administration" or a "oh Jesus Christ this is going to be incredible" kind of Jesus Christ.
2960	You forgot this	Should have bought a PS4 pro, BF1 downscaled from 1800p
2961	LPT: always tell your electronics the truth	LPT: If you're on a simple tv (without a surround sound system), setup your audio to 2.0. This way music and voices will have an equal volume.
2962	Well, it's because they garner the uneducated white male vote, rather than the virtuous inner city, oppressed minority vote.	Yeah. Sadly a lot of the MSM loves to push the agenda that all conservatives are racist, gay-hating, gun touting bigots.
2963	All world governments cause i want to see a world war in my life time	What major company would you like to see fail and why?
2964	Typically made with an entirely different vegetable.... So how's it wasted?	Vodka is just wasted whiskey.
2965	One more night at work for me...	Only one more sleep till Anniversary :-)
2966	Funny how Fisher always ends up in these situations and it's never his fault right?	For whatever reason Fisher wouldn't have it. Vince was Bud's guy. I've heard that the Goff situation is similar.... The owner wanted Goff but Fisher didn't. And we can see how that's going, oddly similar.
2967	I believe in bootstraps at conception.	Don't you know that the second the baby is conceived it's fully developed? Gosh darn liberals.
2968	I'm not sure I would characterize a player who had an injury-plagued season as "dead weight."	Rodney Stuckey Can't Be Dead Weight Again
2969	Oh, you believe Soros actually exists?	Nice try George Soros.
2970	But hey, at least it looks like our productivity rates look great!	Lets try ever decreasing people at work to do the job. But the amount of work doesn't decrease. So your stress level goes higher and higher every layoff due to you needing to go at 100% then 120% then at 140%.....And then you feel trapped etc.... I need a new Job...sigh
2971	No need for that, you have Connor Hallisey	EPB for Tecatito. Who says no?
2972	Even before that they went to retard levels with fan service.	Bioware went down when they started pandering to SJWs and LGBT.
2973	rocket league?	He was quick to Alt+F4 as soon as it was over
2974	Nah man, complaining is obviously the better choice.	Shotgun dropoff is severe once you get out of the range for the specific weapon. Look, just use fusions or sidearms. They are very effective against shotties.
2975	Specifically a sailors tale, I believe.	It's an old myth about Asian women.

2977	surprising shortage of feminist making Youtube videos about this, In other news Pink Tax report at 6	80 percent of women in Pakistan enduring mental, physical torture
2978	I disagree, our secondary was struggling before williams was even injured also Williams was injured most of last season as well and we still thrived in the secondary.	I completely disagree. Our pass defense has had a massive statistical improvement. Outside of the big plays, they're great, and the struggles of our secondary directly correlate with the loss of Aaron Williams, not the hiring of Ed Reed. Donnie Henderson is the most overrated coach in this sub. If he was so great, he wouldn't be the DB coach (not even DC or HC, despite NFL experience), at a middle of the pack college team. Donnie Henderson was not, and is not, a great coach.
2979	Cut the hair, post an update.	Shave my beard the wife said. You will look young again she said.
2980	There's always a hotdog... There's always a bun... There's always a mustard... **CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES**	Saw this is /HistoryPorn. Princess (current Queen) Elizabeth registering for war services in 1942. Check out the patch on her left shoulder. Also, her name!
2981	The Never Ending Story... Great film, although I haven't seen it since I was about 8....	What movie is that?
2982	How much of a premium/gold content is there?	Get something cool. Mine was a World War One era corone from the Austro Hungarian empire with a heck of an interesting portrait, coat of arms and edge lettering.
2983	I mean, sometimes I ban gaz to prevent silly teammates picking him...	Funny idea, but why would they be disappointed. They could get even happy for being feared of their strength.
2984	Your argument is salient and without reproach.	kthxbye

2991	Their outsourced help desks make up 64% of India's economy.	How does Comcast come into this ? lol
2992	Call me stupid but I wish we had gotten a scope on the Piercing Rifle so we could free aim it like a sniper	There are two-handed guns lying around everywhere, notably near your weapon upgrade bench, and mobs certainly use em. I'd have loved a trick weapon that was strictly a gun. L1 switches between 2-handing it L2 2-handed shoots with the same bloodtinge scaling as your LH weapon, both forms. Can Parry. R1 2-handed would toggle a cross-hair R2 2-handed would be a shot with 2x bloodtinge scaling, maybe shorter range? R1 1-handed would be a basic melee attack, high base damage but with no scaling whatsoever R2 1-handed would be another basic attack, charge to backstab I dunno. Would've been neat to have a weapon that made melee disadventageous.
2993	you mean tax payers will save those jobs... but i guess giving those tax payer dollars to a corporation who will "give it to their employees" is better than just cutting the middle man	Yup just forget the fact that he saved over a 1,000 jobs and the well being of those Americans. This thread is unbelievable.
2994	You wouldn't be caught dead *in a hat*?	I would not be caught dead in one.
2995	And didn't we learn that that's pay-for-play if done through the Clinton Foundation?	they are paying 50,000 dollars to a charity....

2999	I don't think it's that deep.	Wait hang on. If a woman is that into having her anterior formix stimulated, why do you need a big dick? Why can't you just... get a dildo, or a cucumber, or a woodwind instrument? And is it really 8 inches deep?
3000	Gross.	I love a man who respects what I want out of life.
3001	stamps?	Paypal Sapphire RX 480 8gb
3002	Riot said they didn't want to do this with Vel'koz as it made his Ult seem miniscule when zoomed out, and they thought it went against his theme to have a small ray of destruction.	As a long range ult, Vel'koz should have the same kind of unzoom like Xerath or Jhin. That's actually really annoying in term of vision. I play with a semi-locked camera (can't play with unlocked) and sometimes i strugle because the ult is going out of the screen or just right at the end, and we get easily fucked because sometimes, we can't see the ennemies because they are OUT of the screen with the ult too. I don't think it's really fair to see that people which play with locked camera or like me with Semi-locked camera are getting punished about that. The ult is really long and we should have a little unzoom. Even a little it would be appreciated. We should be equal to the others and being punished about a playstyle with the camera, it's really unfair.
3003	If "late model" is supposed to be old, then what's "early model" supposed to be?	Apparently for your TV show to make it big on AMC, you really need a late model RV
3004	What tickers and what dates?	Is there any websites that track shorts on a regular basis and provide charts? Hey - so I was wondering, is there any websites or trading sites that provide charts tracking shorts over time on a symbol? I am interested in knowing a few dates in particular on a symbol but have been unsuccessful in goolging this. I'm not sure if I know what to search for.
3005	But isn't that something a face would do?	there really is no reason for him to be a face hahahah. They had a good thing when he came back and pedigree'd roman. They should of ran with that.

3008	You still can, but you only have one shot.	Ask the airbenders. Oh wait! You can't!
3009	Or maybe so much coding has made them believe that things can only be quantified in absolutes.	You'd think with all their experience with binary that they'd understand that gender isn't binary. Um... I'll just... go.
3010	"But if we try harder to cram it down their throats next time , then it will surely work" - Ryan	What's crazy is that we already know their plans don't work, historically. Getting rid of unions? Environmental regulation? Consumer protection? Yeah, it failed, hence why we changed to what we have now.
3011	an douche *ehem*	You're a douche.
3012	It is Poland now(and only has been since WWII) but it was Germany(well a state of the HRE) when the killing happened	But it was Poland when it was uncovered, just like the title says, wasn't it?
3013	Reptilians don't age!	I think she is like 110-120 so, yeah
3014	Karl Marx, eh?	Think about that
3015	Oh I see, working professionals should take advice from sub-20 year olds on the internet and expend the time to have 3 working OSes on their computer.	I've upgraded directly from El Capitan to Sierra before with 0 issue, and that's as major of an upgrade as you can do. Don't act like these issues are inherent to having a hackintosh, it happens to some but not all. Not to mention, you can just boot up into a Linux or Windows partition on the rare occasion the macOS is truly FUBAR.
3016	thanks for your input :)	I like Batum as well but I don't think it's getting better than last season's numbers. My concern with Ibaka is that over the past few years he's shown regression blocking shots, and besides that what does he offer that Draymond doesn't? So I guess the question is do you have a 3 and D guy available on the wire who can give you part of the production Batum would. For a top 15 guy I think it's worth it.
3017	G-G-G-GODLIKE	Don't forget about the redeemer! Multi Kill!
3018	It's so weird that your original comment saying you hated the song got downvoted a lot but this comment with reasons got upvoted.	I just feel like the production on Big Brother is uninspired, boring and lazy, and the lyrics are cheesy af
3019	I'm of literally the exact the same mindset... Don't go and prey on vulnerable people in poor countries for the purpose of indoctrination, but really, how can we fault them for being good members of the community?	Agreed, I'm not religious but sometimes it feels like churches, mosques, etc. can't win. If they keep to themselves and don't help, they're not exercising what they preach but if they try to help people, they're "indoctrinating". It bothers me when people go on missions to other countries and just hand out pamphlets instead of doing anything worthwhile, but it's not worth hating on a religious institution when it's actively trying to help in the local community

3021	Vermont, settled on something (that was similar to the previous designs) in 1985 and has stuck with it.	Colorado has stayed very consistent.
3022	just block them, and live a pleasant life.	Maybe it's just me, but somehow I don't feel as if ads have become any more relevant to me now, as opposed to 8 years ago when Facebook didn't own any of the big social media service providers. There's just more ads...
3023	Yeah, because the right never insults anyone with a different opinion and Trump has the highest morals and would never do such a thing, ever.	You guys realize that this mentality is the reason Hillary lost ? You can't just insult people with differing opinions and expect them to jump onboard with your ideas.

3033	Nah, Perkz is a piece of shit and he should get about 90% of all the blame with the rest of the blame going to Ocelote.	Seems you've forgotten his inting in MSI. I agree Perkz was the bigger problem most of the time but Trick invading and dying over and over didn't help either.

Brewers can only win 86 games, the Cubs picked up their 87th win today against the Giants 2-1.

Nutshack was difficult; if I amplified the volume, the beat became too loud (wearing headphones, it actually kinda hurt to listen to), but if I lowered the volume, the audio balance was bad. Could've found a better method of balancing it, though; this also happens to be my first time using Audacity in any depth, so I didn't use much besides manually changing tempo and amplifying things. I also know that Audacity isn't great in terms of what I'm using it for, but I'm not ~~old~~ commited enough to get a PayPal and pay for any kind of software. I'll try to find something, though (if I continue with this at least semi-seriously).

Not only are we going to lose the presidency now, we're in danger of losing the Senate because every Senator up for re-election is enduring a barrage of this-guy-is-associated-with-Trump ads.

3131	Like a children's charity ran by Jared Fo-oh shit no that happened too.	well then i guess then the currency union has to make certain steps so that reworked greece debt is not sold for usury rates by banksters. original greek debt was 180b reduced to 120b guaranteed by other eu countries. yet for some reason banks getting loans from ecb for 0-1% were forcing on market 20+% interest rates on this said debt, making it baloon in 6 years to 320+billion now take into the fact that currency union is run by ECB "experts" who became "experts" by working in commercial banks, same banks that made all these usury rate profits, i think the saying is appropriate "chicken hen run by foxes"
3132	You dropped a	Yeah buying cod.iw is a great deal you can buy it complete the campaing and refund it without surpassing the 2 hour limit
3133	Wave off the lights	Bungie, please give us the option to keep the lights off at Aksis. I would love to have the option to do both phase 1 and 2 of the Aksis fight in the dark. Maybe a monitor on one of the sides could be used to toggle the option before the start of the encounter. It would be one of the most aesthetically pleasing fights in the game due to how great the lighting in this area already is and how our guardians would look with certain armour on.
3134	UR Storm runs 3 Shivan Reef - this will be tonnes better, especially seeing how life loss is a big problem for storm with eidolon in most burn decks	This significantly improves the manabases of so many lists - UR delver, all Jeskai lists, all Abzan lists - oh my god this is amazing.

3139	Racist is as racist does.	They weren't racist comments. They were comments, made by a racist. Call him what he is. Stop acting like it was a slip of the tongue or a lapse in judgement. He is a racist and thus says racist things.
3140	Turtle was one of the few good things that came out from TSM in S3 Worlds.	the main difference is, that wildturtle xpecial bot lane was world class. this worlds has proven that NAs bot lane werent very competitive this year
3141	Or fertilizer and pesticides cost rise to the point where no one wants to grow corn.	I'm not sure if you're being facetious or not. Corn is a renewable resource. The only way to "run out of corn" would be if an entire crop was destroyed by some sort of pest, or a prolonged drought (like the Dustbowl in the 1930's)
3142	Na, its definitely rock and roll	So I'm not crazy??
3143	No worries, were about to vote good ole Hillary-buddy-buddy-with-the-Saudis into office... Surely this criminal government of ours will change!	Murika isn't good. It's actually much worse than the UAE. Where you see complexity, I see a simpleton's sideshow to distract from the real issues: wealthy people committing atrocities across the world to increase their wealth and power. Your smug sense of superiority is doing an excellent job at making you incapable of understanding real problems.
3144	it's what CNN says so it must be right	So is there a poll that says a majority of Trump supports are racist? It is that just what the media tells you

3150	No it is still: Dear white male students, go Fuck yourselves because you are the problems for all of the above.	Dear white male students, You are not the cause of everyone's problems
3151	Yeah laughing mockingly is totally not an insult.	All she did is say she didn't want to fuck a dude she just met. Which was followed by "you're not that great"
3152	That's an excellent metaphor for what's happening to Roush.	NASCAR. Think of it as kinda like Texas. Used to be dominant, now kinda fading. That's what's basically happening there.
3153	the comment they deleted had been given gold 9 times, r/news and trying so hard to cover up that people actually support going against democrats	they have a new comment with gold they wana push check it its like 5 paragraphs at the end hes im just a normal guy and found all this by accident
3154	so it's not that it can't happen, it's just unlikely?	Thank you. An officer will be there. Stories where an officer don't show up and the ticket gets thrown out are very far and few between.

3156	Yeah and the ones that don't mind kind of laugh and say they are sorry but they can't read your fanfic.	One thing I've heard about it is that, for a lot of authors, they literally can't mention fan fiction. Too risky if the idea they stole something from a fanfic gets popular, if I remember what Jim Butcher said right.

3214	Fair, although I do think there is a certain loss of emphasis, but that's just my opinion.	Hmm? I'm confused as to what you mean. I would just say "that's dumb" instead of "that's retarded" and move on with my life.
3215	Forgot to add that	Lol

3227	I'd definitely pay 15 or 20 bucks to have a campaign DLC for siege.	The campaign never existed. Before Siege, there was Rainbow 6 Patriots. Patriots was scrapped when the next generation console were announced. It was in the making for 4.5(?) years. They figured it would cost way too much do do all of the art, programming and whatnot all over again so they scrapped it and made Siege instead. It makes me wonder if they plan to make a a campaign only game or stand alone DLC using the funds Siege has generated.

3238	Eeeey thats pretty salty	Why I hate the hype for SL. And sometimes just hype in general. Two rants in one week. You know, 'cause there wasn't enough salt last time. Anyyyyywayyyys. Note the disclaimer. DISCLAIMER: Before you start reading let me just say this is supposed to be a little satirical so take what I say in here with a grain of salt. However this does kind of mimic how I feel. Enjoy. Hype... I love hype. When you are watching some Smash Bros and Captain Falcon lands a falcon punch after a huge combo... Well, it's the most hype thing ever. HOWEVER, there is another kind of hype. There is Captain Falcon combo hype and new game release hype. Let me explain. Let's take a look at a game called No Man's Sky. NMS was hyped up to be THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME, but when the game came out people didn't like it. And I think that might happen with SL. We are hyping up SL a lot. VOICE ACTORS. ANIMATIONS. NEW ANIMATRONICS. MORE POR- I MEAN LORE.... More lore... And the problem with that is, what if the game is average. If the game is average and we hyped it up a lot then we will look at the game as bad rather than average. Going back to No Man's Sky, I would say NMS is a pretty average game, but because it was hyped up a lot people didn't look at it like an average game, they looked at it like a bad game. How we look at the game BEFORE the game comes out will affect how we look at the game AFTER the game comes out. So. What should you take from this? Well, SL won't be perfect. It's good to be hyped for the game but don't get so hyped that you tell yourself that SL will be the best game in the series. So stay hyped, but not too h- HELL YEAH! JUST LANDED THE FALCON PUNCH! WOOOOOO! Writing rants on r/fivenightatfreddys during study hall at school. Classy. If you want to see more rants then tell me in the comments, and also tell me what you want to see me rant on next. BYE!

3240	Spam laugh and watch people lose their shit over some kid on the internet laughing over a video game.	How do you have fun with Loki? I'm grinding out gods and he's SO BORING. Just sit back. Use your 2. Then wait for a squishy to get weak, ult them, then stealth out. This is seriously thr least fun I've ever had with a god. How do I make it fun? Team fights are boring because I'm never in them. And farming is boring because there's no risk. I'm even in arena and I'm miserable.
3241	Real smart fans wait till halftime to buy a ticket for pennies on the dollar	Ever looked at single tickets 30 minutes before the game? That's when they really start tanking in price.
3242	Get off Reddit then!	Meta: Needed in this sub - More nuance When someone asks whether we should be worried about player X after week 1, it's met with a flurry of "Drop him then" or "It's been one week" etc. You can be worried about a player without panicking. Brandon Marshall, for example: WRs his age do not typically do well, except for him and Fitz and a few others. He was amazing last year. You could be worried that he'll be closer to WR15-20 than 5-10 like last year and that is reasonable. Applies to other situations too, that's one example. Just a thought.
3243	True but that thing sucks balls	There's usually a book or electronic device you can use to look them up. Buy good wipers, it's cheaper than replacing them all the time or not seeing.

3246	And the worst part is it makes my gold farming a lot slower	Players Should Not Drop to Such Low Ranks At End of Season I just lost to a fully golden Dragon Warrior with the Legend Card Back. At Rank 18. Why is it that ex legend rank players are able to drop to ranks where beginning players are only barely just getting out of 'You Can't Lose Stars At This Rank'? It would be much more profitable to reduce the number of stars lost in the rankdown at the end of season so that the extremely high skill players weren't in the same levels of play as low skill players or beginners. It's just plain broken.

3253	That's what this game needed to be, pay to win!	Item Idea: Rare Candies Rare Candies. $5 dollars a peice. Before you scream "WHAT THE *r* THAT IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!11!1", This is how they would work. (Pretty OP.) So, Rare Candies would basically be a normal substitute for candy and stardust. When you get to your trainer levels CP range, You can advance a few more trainer levels with the rare candies before being done. For example, Level 25 Pokemon at Level 20 with 5 extra rare candies. And no, You wouldn't be able to go insane and get Level 40 Pokemon at Level 1, Just a FEW more above. Thanks for reading this.

I just finished listening to a history podcast by Dan Carlin about the Persian Empire and I was wondering if there have been any movies about the Persian Empire from a Persian perspective?

She is 200% Catholic (at least culturally). So every person in her entire extended family was just insulted. Also, it's almost certain that Megyn's parents had her baptized, thus her offense at the Clinton campaigns presumption of ulterior motives.

Yesterday evening stopped by the Gilroy supercharger, and all 10 stalls where taken up, and 3 cars were waiting. This is fine and doesn't bother me, but what bothers me is 4 of the 10 weren't even charging, and by the time my turn was up to charge, those 4 cars still haven't moved. Couple issues here: 1) People should just charge to their next destination. 2) Charging from 80% to 100% takes twice as long as 0% to 80%, that means these people were parked there for at least an hour. 3) Currently no way to enforce this.

3291	You just got one from Director Comey.	I would love an explanation of how her mishandling of classified info wasn't willfull.
3292	He didn't say they weren't better with Grier than without... lol but to that point, even Grier-less Florida hung with Bama.	Most reasonable people would agree that UF with Grier was a lot better than UF without Grier.
3293	And what is his address and social security number?	What was his name and what teams was he on?
3294	Is this a bot for real	I'm a bot. I try to make pictures easier to find on reddit by describing them and adding hashtags.

3297	check in videos, there should be a folder call pictures and inside there is camera roll	Thanks for the info. I am trying it on my phone right now, but I cannot find the camera roll in there, can you confirm that you can see the camera roll videos in the film and tv app?
3298	Steak	What's a non-drug item that you would willingly overdose on?
3299	Considering that sword that you get from the gnome warrior quest is deliberately moggable by all, I'd say working as intended.	I can transmog to the Greatsword of the Sunwalker, a weapon from a Tauren Paladin quest on my Alliance Warrior.
3300	I thought it was a colander.	That's a space station!
3301	Nah, Nagato is pretty fine even without Manual Secondaries, but her damage potential isn't really that good because her casemate secondary guns fire an AP shell, and not HE.	So, dont go for brawler till captain is lvl 15 then, you'd say?
3302	Dude, you can walk in with "back pain" and walk out with opiates.	Which is what I really don't get... I understand that prescription pain meds are a serious problem, but from my personal experience with pretty severe injuries they haven't been "given out like candy". For example, when I blew out my knee and went to the er (fractured tibial head, although not a bad fracture, and tore my acl and mcl) they send me home with six percocet, and didn't give me anything iv. When I eventually had surgery my physician gave me the adequate amount of pills for post op pain, but nothing over the top at all. Idk, maybe I've just had docs that are better educated on narcotics abuse? Although honestly, my experience at the er was pretty horrific. There's a happy medium between under and over medicating, and to say I was under medicated is an understatement.
3303	Gotta love the non-musician crapping on successful musician posts.	Which crappy musicians do you believe lucked out by being in a band with awesome musicians? So many come to mind. I realise that some of these crappy musicians add a band dynamic that can't be replicated, I'm just curious to see who you all think was the luckiest of shittiest.
3304	First time I've heard a player talk about this and actually take responsibility for willfully abusing the drug instead of blaming everything on the drug or on the league for giving them access.	Brett Favre on quitting Vicodin: I shook every night

3311	thank you and yes	Very nice job! Great job on the fonts and I love the filter effect on Sanders in the last one. I copied the bernie for the people and the last one for my friend who is working on stuff for a center in Fort Bragg Ca. That OK if she chooses to use them?
3312	Love: Jodi Hate: Josephine	What is your favorite name? Which name do you absolutely hate?
3313	most likely, but it must be an irrelevant nation anyway.	South Africa?
3314	Considering the games fan base Allah Akbar ?	I wonder if at E3 2015 what people would have thought if you told them that two weeks after release, No Man's Sky would share the same Metacritic score as Metroid: Federation Force.
3315	Its true	Apologetic nonsense.
3316	So when you run out of flags...?	Use the primary armament mod and the flags..
3317	Make sure to read up on some of the fights, a few mechanics can kill max level if you don't know how it works	Yeah, at level 100 you'll be able to solo the *vast majority* of 5-man dungeons. The only ones that are a little iffy are the normal WoD ones (but you'll be able to access them in heroic mode through dungeon finder anyway). You'll be able to do most of the old raid content too - so if you're level 100 and never got a chance to do some of the really cool raids like Blackwing Lair, Tempest Keep, or Ulduar, you'll be able to go back and give it a look (while collecting some flippin' sweet transmog pieces at the same time!)
3318	Did the Pope forget radical Muslims hate Christians?	Pope Francis, Chief Cuck of the Vatican, praises London's new Islamic Mayor. Praises Islamic invasion into Europe.
3319	Yes ... but only in 99 years.	So my landlord called me and then I gave her my full name and my date of birth. Is that OK? Do I have to worry about my privacy etc?
3320	VAMO A CALMARNO	Does anyone drop their s' at the end of words? I find myself doing this a lot like instead of saying el perro es negro I say el perro e negro.

3321	Well I don't want to talk to anybody about anything on this shit website unless they have a PhD in that field or they are a 5 star general.	there are probably are a lot of people of have at least studied economics, js

3335	Iirc they said Geralt's adventures are done, but they may do some other games with totaly different characters or something else, the world is rich enough for it to work, I hope at least.	Interesting because they claim to be done making Witcher games for the foreseeable future. They will probably do a more in depth reveal of Cyberpunk in a few months, and that will the the "next big thing."
3336	But Obama isn't black, he's white.	I guess that's why a black persons been running the most powerful country for 8 years
3337	FFS It's been years and that still makes me want to cry like the little bitch I am.	It's a terrible day for rain.
3338	40% taxes between cali and fed at 40k sounds pretty close.	If you make 40k you aren't losing 16k to taxes though. Not even close.

3349	Mind Control + Triple Tap, ignoring how vulnerable it makes your own heroes :P	HoTS, what pair or group of ultimate abilities work well together but are weak by themselves? It can be one strong ult making a weak one stronger too. For me it's Rain of Destruction + Earthquake. RoD does high damage if people are getting hit and EQ has almost the same exact AOE size with a temporary slow.
3350	Its shiny colors will be neon purple and diarrhea green.	I personally like it, but hopefully they don't just switch it to black on pink in the shiny form so people who don't like the pink color can maybe also give it a chance.
3351	Especially for people like me whose team seems to be in the minority in their town.	Yeah, that would be nice!

3355	Yeah, but you're a figment of your imagination too, so welcome to the matrix.	You could be a figment of my imagination. I keep thinking this and I thought harder about this when I watched the Matrix movie. You could be a figment of my imagination. You may not be real. I will never know what it is to be you. This could be a computerized system controlling me. Maybe I am dreaming and this is all an illusion. One which I can't prove nor deny. The whole world is a figment of your imagination. Maybe you don't really exist and I only created you in my mind. Maybe my mind is making this whole thing up.
3356	woah...	Yes, and I am the woman in red.
3357	Jesus	I remember my mom would take days off work to sit at home and watch the trial on TV
3358	Ewww why did you not just choose **either** medicine **or** research then?	That I enjoy research.
3359	That my friend, is the 'gravitas' settling.	No, they do this every time, and I agree it is absolute insanity. I have no idea why or how they started to do this. Nothing else on television throughout recorded history does this. I mean, it basically creates dead air, which is a cardinal sin of any broadcast.
3360	Kind of the story of her campaign.	That should be illegal, it is some next-level propaganda preparing you to accept the coming election fraud.
3361	The mom sounds like a fat whale	Father's day from 4 year old Hadley's perspective.
3362	Great info, thanks!	The Libertarian Party / left-libertarianism in general is collectivist, while right-libertarian is more individualistic. A left-libertarian believes that property can not be truly "owned". They always want open borders, they want free trade at any cost. A right-libertarian believes in property rights and unequal possession of said property (aka inequality). I am a strong proponent of inequality, because equality does not and should not exist in a natural setting (because people are not equal). In order to create "equality" (ala via socialistic / communistic methods) you have to suppress the strong. This leads to a major loss in innovation and motivation of those individuals. Quote from wikipedia: "Right libertarians strongly support private property rights, and defend unequal distribution of natural resources and private property.[2] This position is contrasted with that of some versions of left-libertarianism, which maintain that natural resources belong to everyone in some egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively.[3] Right-libertarianism includes anarcho-capitalism and laissez-faire, minarchist liberalism."

3371	Thanks, I've been watching your MBLD vids and they're really motivating	Don't worry about it, I think it took around 10 tries (maybe more?) to finally get my first success. I'm sub-2 now and I still mess up often. That's really close, so you're already better than I was. :)
3372	I thought they did nominate literally hitler?	We told them this would happen. And now they act *soooooo* surprised. This is like a game of chicken. You have the Sanders Bus and the Hillary Limo. Hillary Limo believes they can scare the sanders bus off the road. Unfortunately for them they thought all the people on the sanders bus were just *bluffing* when the truth was, it's actually full of people who made peace with the possibility of failure and resigned themselves **from the start**. People like me. There is nothing, **absolutely nothing**, that could have ***ever*** pursuaded me to vote for hillary. Even if bernie sanders had *never existed* in the first place, I'd still never be voting for hillary. I wouldn't be voting for hillary if the republicans nominated **literally hitler**. I wouldn't be voting for hillary if trump had a button in his possession that would cause all the nukes on earth to spontaneously detonate all at once which he was going to press the moment he won. Unlike Hillary, I stick to my choices. When I say I'm going to do something, I fucking do it. When I say I'm not going to do something, I **don't** fucking do it. I am not untapped potential. My momentum is not going in the direction they want to move in, and it never will. Never. But they're welcome to crash directly into me and eat my grill. I was going this way all along and I'm not going to pretend they're not responsible for deliberately interposing themselves into my path.

What niches do they fill (e.g. crash compilation, funny, mod reviews)? Personally I always like to see new things I'd like to try myself.
3379	Thats because 90-95% of the Bernie supports will vote for her, just wait.	She could be 50 points behind Trump and Nate Silver would still say that she has like 80% chance of beating him.
3380	Spotify sends a test voltage through the potentiometer in the speaker knob to see if your music is *actually* playing.	They don't use a microphone to know. It just pauses it if you turn your system output volume level down below a certain threshold. If you have external speakers, just use the analog level control on the speakers to turn the volume off while the ads are playing. Spotify will never be able to tell.
3381	It is now more an epic with a proc.	Let's remember that the very definition of legendary has changed. It used to be a very rare peice of gear that only a few people per guild would get. But now, it's meant to be basically any item that has HFC classtrinket like effects. So yes, the definition of "legendary" has been somewhat watered down but we have to stop thinking of legendary items as if they're still the vanilla, tbc or wotlk style legendaries.

3386	Pointing out that a woman is lying is sexist	They'll readily call Trump a liar when he lies but never Hillary. Hillary is a gentle princess that needs to be protected, but she's somehow also like super tough or something like that
3387	Candidates shouldn't be judged on the things they do or say, they should only be judged on how I *feel*.	How is pointing out things he actually said = propaganda?
3388	C'mon, it's NASA... If they can allegedly put a man on the moon can't they figure out this simple little problem?	NASA probably can't even do that because when released the camera would be orbiting the sun at the same speed the earth is, so it would need to produce thrust to "stop", which would cause it to start falling into the sun, do it would need to produce constant thrust to remain "motionless" (and even then you'd need the fuel to create enough distance to observe the orbit). It's possible if fuel isn't an issue, but also an insane thing to ask for.

3424	she could be the first prez without a security clearance.	Or, you could look at it as a pretty huge deal. A newspaper that has been leading the charge of 'hillary for prison' is now saying, "after looking at the information available, it's looking like they wont be able to meet the threshold for "intent" after all. Which, as many of us have been pointing out here for months, makes this "mishandling of information" at best.
3425	Bless their fat wallets.	I've seen many Hillary trolls saying corruption is okay, everyone is corrupt, and that she won't actually have to help the elite anyways. Apparently businessmen just give money out to politicians of the goodness of their hearts. Its about as legitimate of a theory as trickle down economics.
3426	Yeah man, the ~5 seconds it takes to delete a bounty is game breaking.	Reduce the time to delete a bounty I know it's just a bounty, but when you have to delete five of them it's annoying as hell. It takes longer to delete a bounty then a character.
3427	Oh yes, because it's SO bad they found a way to add some semblance of fun to EV training	My issue with Gen 6 is megas, and the whole super training/easier EV training in general. It's like they watered down competitive gameplay training, but it should've remained as is.

3446	Yeah go ahead and contact Apple, they'll help	I don't have a login for the app. I bought it outright. I do have a purchase receipt, and if I don't hear something from Plex about making it work I'm going to Apple support. This bait+switch should be illegal or at least get their dev account revoked.
3447	I look forward to the day when he gets to cast a tournament again.	Update on Shalthis's Stroke Recovery From his wife: I apologize for taking so long to update, but I have some really great news to share. Steve has been breathing on his own for over two weeks now. He is doing so well they no longer keep the ventilator in his room. He has been working with a speaking valve and although his speech is a little shaky, his voice is getting stronger. He will make big improvements as long as he keeps practicing. Also, he was sitting up in a chair for almost 2 hours today. It was his first time sitting in a chair and he did wonderful for his first time. Progression is slow but he is making big steps in his recovery. Thank you all for your support and thoughts and prayers.

3452	What are you talking about, every young attractive woman is lonely and single and just desperately waiting for some kind gentlesir to take an interest in them on the subway.	The only people who randomly talk to strangers on the street are panhandlers, scam artists, religious zealots, lost tourists and nutjobs. We don't randomly engage with people here like that. While it's not beyond the pale to engage in banter with someone else in a line or in a public situation, it is not where you pick people up. You need to go to social events where macking on people is expected or at least tolerated. Bars, meetup events, parties, clubs, etc. Not the subway, the gym. Maybe hanging in the park if you're smooth and she's chilling. Try online stuff, too. All that said, no fucking shit you haven't met anybody. You've only been here two weeks! Even with the gender imbalance in the city, there are still a ton of options for people, so it's not like every woman is just waiting for some guy to approach. Moreover, people can go on dozens of dates and not go further. Even when you get to the "got a date" level, you're not automatically likely to go further. You're not going to find your soulmate during a summer internship in the city. (And it doesn't have anything to do with your face.)
3453	Yeah it's almost like roads follow a predictable pattern of decay, needed repairs/construction, and we have a limited transportation budget.	Took me two hours to get from Plymouth to my house. Normally takes thirty minutes. MNDOTs genius crew has so many projects going on now it's insane and should be illegal. How about we use part of this supposed awesome one billion dollar surplus and use it to accelerate these retarded projects?
3454	Yeah, essentially he single handed told the economists and the companies that leaving EU is a good idea.	He orchestrated this. his job was to make sure the economy wouldn't take a big hit during the refferendum, he purposefully scared off investors and gave all of these doomsday prophecies if Brexit won in order to destabalize the economy to force Britain back into the EU. Stay strong Britain! you'll recover in no time!

He's a disgusting-looking man with alcohol and pill problems who talks about nothing but right-wing talking points, guns, and 40 year old pop culture references. He's also 65 years old and is related to Joe Cumia and his friends all look like Fat from Brooklyn.

3487	So the answer to that is more missiles?	You are aware of the number of near misses? One that particularly blew my mind was the dead hand policy implemented by Russia. If the underground nuclear bunkers lost contact with Moscow for a period of time they were instructed to fire back at certain targets. Effectively saying even if you kill the leadership we will still take you out. Twice that I've read about there was a situation where contact was lost with Moscow. The commander on site went over the head of his previous orders to not press the button. Had he followed protocol it could of been all out war. Numerous close calls like this happened over the years. There was a definite exaggeration and conspiracy based red under the bed situation. But there was genuine reasons to be fearful.

3496	No team queues, replay save and match history in hearthstone	What is actually quite baffling to me is how many obvious mistakes like this are in Overwatch and yet Blizzard has multiple examples FROM THEIR OWN GAMES for what to do properly. Other Blizzard games have solo and team queue, but not Overwatch. Other Blizzard games allow you to save the replay of the full game, Overwatch doesn't even let you save your highlights. Other Blizzard games let you see match history, Overwatch lets you see nothing.

Any problems with that?

3517	I know that in Canada, only semi-automatic rifles are permitted (there are more variables to consider but you get my.point), did your uncle abide by that rule when he came hunting?	My uncle went hunting in Canada a few years back (post-9/11). He was allowed to fly in with his rifle, but there were all sorts of rules and regulations about how it was to be secured, etc. Are they changing that, or was this just some particular American tourists being dumb?
3518	We'd need to test using blue light and caffeine.	More likely melatonin since the suprachiasmatic nucleus is responsible for regulating its release. The SCN is inhibited as long as your eyes are recieving blue wavelength light (I forget what the actual cutoff wavelength is). When it gets dark and there is no more blue light then after about an hour the SCN starts releasing melatonin, pushing us further into our sleep cycles. Adenosine builds up during waking hours. But it could very well be part of these boy's condition.

When you factor in Mega Aggron, that puts the beast at 630. Weavile is definitely a good candidate for a mega, but Delibird has a long way to go, unless they do an insane Gyarados-style evolution where the evolved stats are increased beyond the usual formula (from 200 to 540), and that's not even factoring in its joke of a movepool and horrible typing.

Joe Scarborough says he talked to a guy who says he advised Trump. Not nearly enough confirmation. Also too big of a story to just casually mention so long after the fact. At this point all we have is some unsubstantiated hearsay, and not even current hearsay at that. Remember when journalism was actually a thing?

3573	GG without uni can beat BD.	There were a few topics on the old forums about these two. The consensus was that Goblin did way more damage un-uniformed with an old-style poison gear. The uniformed goblin can be useful in a combat AB, but he's not all that great at anything else compared to all the higher tiered combat characters like Iron Fist or Carnage. Destroyer's great, especially when you know he's going up against World Bosses. He may not do much damage on his own, but if you can get placed to receive the brunt of an energy blast, he can cancel out and usually obliterate a proxima/thanos/etc before he dies. If you aren't playing against other players that have huge energy attacks, he's mediocre.

3591	Man, fuck borders	My Life as an Illegal Immigrant (and other things) The fact that I'm an illegal immigrant is not something I tell most people, for obvious reasons. We are literally the scum of the earth, or so people refer to us as. I was born in an Asian country and my family moved to the US when I was 4 years old - to the south, no less. Growing up, I was shy, but I was a normal kid growing up in a normal life. I learned the language quickly because I came when I was so young. By the time I was in high school, I was taking AP Lang and AP Lit classes, which was always funny to me that I, an Asian, was in these classes while people that were born here weren't. It was funny, but I mean I grew up in the states, so it really made no difference that I was Asian. I was an American. Or so I thought. Halfway into junior year, my parents spill the beans on our immigration status. When we first moved here, we came on a visa that had expired. We applied for our green card, but our family was scammed by our lawyer the first time. We ended up losing thousands of dollars. Later, when my parents had saved up enough money, they tried applying again. We got passed a few steps I guess because at the moment, I have a social security number (but on it is a print that says "Valid for work only with DHS authorization"). However, that's pretty much how far we got. It's a little fuzzy because of the language barrier between my parents and I, but this is generally how I understand it went down. There were certain fees (my parents use the word taxes; I'm not sure if that's the right word so I'm saying fees) that my parents insisted on paying for the green card, apparently something on top of the actual fee. The lawyer told my parents that there was no need to pay those. Reluctantly, my parents agreed. This resulted in us being declined. Here I am as a junior in high school, after 12+ years growing up in the US, that I'm not actually a legal citizen. At first, it's really hard to take in. Imagine waking up one day at that age and being told that you are a fugitive, unwanted. What did I do? I didn't break any rules. I only had one detention ever in high school, and that was for being late to a test. I was a good kid - but wait, I'm an illegal. Suddenly, I can't go to decent colleges. I can't apply for scholarships. I can't get a job either. I can't do anything. "Why didn't you just go back to where you came from?" people would ask. I came from the states, the south. That's all I remember as a kid. Should I go back to a country I've never been to, with a culture and language I'm not truly accustomed to? Going back to where I came from - it should be simple, right? ... My brother had to go back. Back to where he supposedly "came from". What good was it staying here? He couldn't go to school because he couldn't commute to the community college that actually accepted him. Sometimes my brother would drive to school with only his permit. He couldn't get a license even though he was a perfectly capable driver. He went for a year, but the burden was too much on his friend that had to drive him there for classes. So he went back to our "home" country to attend school. He misses the states, and we miss him to this day because he cannot come back here for 10 years. Luckily for me, the Obama administration passed an executive order for people like me that were brought here as kids to be able to get a few benefits. Unfortunately, this happened a few months after my brother had already gone back. I get that some people don't like this initiative from the president's administration. However, it has been a lifesaver for me, and thousands of other people like me. I was able to get a work permit and a limited term driver's license. This allowed me to finish my associates degree. And guess what? I paid 3x the normal tuition rate because I have to pay in-state AND out-of-state tuition. After paying our taxes in full to the state and national, I have to pay in-state + out-of-state. It really is a joke to me. A horrible joke. I paid around $1,000 per class at a community college. The only reason I didn't pursue a bachelors is because I would have to pay 2x THAT price, resulting in nearly $2,000 per class. I can't get scholarships or loans, so that wasn't an option. I started working. And here I am today. Still not sure about my future here. Maybe eventually I will have to move and start a new life. Please for the sake of love don't judge us illegal immigrants so simply.
3592	You can record your gameplay and play it back in slow motion	I care because I like seeing slight difference in the smoothness. I absolutely love my 144hz monitor. What's the point of getting a card that pulls 120 fps if your monitor is only capable of 60?
3593	Excuse me sirrrrr.... I think you mean soccer balll	When you take a muddy football to the head
3594	You forgot this.	yep, exactly!
3595	Each time I see this room, and this room in particular, all I can think of is the "Mad World" song playing in my head.	Stupid flies
3596	You forgot this:	Seems like this could be easily solved by displaying a very clear arrow when placing the teleporter.
3597	ive heard wonderful things about SAP	I would have to order it through SAP. SAP is horrible, and I would likely spend hours on the phone trying to find the order numbers and account numbers... I'll get to it...
3598	Just be happy, it is that easy	Seriously. Even some people who've been diagnosed are ignorant. They expect everyone else's symptoms to look like theirs or it somehow is not a true Depression diagnosis??? "If I can get out of bed, you should be able to, too." "If I can get through the day without weird, spontaneous crying jags, you should be able to, too." Fuck right off.
3599	Text wasn't yellow, downvoted	Kicking the wrong people in clan chat.
3600	Payday loans	I think money flow is a better example. Difference being able to pay your bills on time or pay your rent but over the course of a month incurring late fees or overdraft charges. Or paying for something outright compared to over time with interest.
3601	Plot twist, the CPS is coming to get him for taking that poor women's baby.	A West Virginia police officer pulled over a very drunk woman whose baby was covered in feces and vomit in the back seat. The baby was screaming, so the officer bathed him in the barracks sink while waiting for child protective services. The smile kills me.
3602	Yeah, because there's no evidence of him being a liar or anything.	Trump had to say something innocuous because you can't just admit to bribery on national TV. Either it stops at the wedding and he's lying about the corruption or it goes much farther and Trump is basically saying that he is an active participant in political corruption and has been for years. He's either a liar or super shady. gg.
3603	Sameeeeeeee	Will we be able to see Insomnia footage? I need some of that Creature D and D ;(
3604	Why didn't they build a "quality bus corridor"?	I was there last Summer and can confirm there is one.
3605	Our DNA is the dictionary for the "background noise" to be uncompressed...	Isn't our own DNA actually reasonably likely to be a form of interplanetary communication? Maybe our "junk DNA" is really an invitation from the Old Ones to come to an intragalactic pizza party, once we figure out how to read our DNA properly.
3606	I thing it's because infinite warfare has cod slapped on it	Not hating, but how come this game seems to be getting praise but Infinite Warfare has got an unholy amount of hate?
3607	Trojan - Think big.	What marketing slogan would have a completely different meaning if used on another brand/product?
3608	Uninstaller the Assassin's Creed mod.	How do I get a clean install?
3609	I was going to say that Q would take too long with this format, but with the 3 rounds that it currently has, it may be about the same.	I could actually be for this. I loved the All-Star qualifying format how they come flying onto pit road and the pit crews get involved
3610	Yeah this movie is totally going to stay true to its roots	Maybe if the movie was based on Vanilla World of Warcraft and not Warcraft 1.
3611	Don't believe your lying eyes people.	Economic research does not support the idea that America's trade deals have cost the country jobs and lowered incomes.
3612	Ugh, we all know that microwaving your phone only charges it	Prove it. With your phone.
3613	Fake.	What a multi
3614	Wow thank you for explaining that, I definitely would have never gotten it.	The one movie Rick Astley will never lend you from his Disney collection (he's never gonna give you "Up")
3615	That's fine but there's nothing that supports your claim.	And I claim that he will not waive the loans at the end
3616	Naw, he just means Geese that are Canadian citizens	**Canada** geese
3617	Same, just on a different approach: "FOR THE GREATER WEEABOO!"	Tau first, IG second. The first because I love sci-fi, and they're definitely the best 'good guys' in the 40K empire. Plus they use modern tactics and are the ones who make the most sense to me. IG because tanks, trenches, and glorious human wave assaults ;)

3620	Maybe if he'd stop crying he'd be able to see the ball and play better	That's absurd. Flores' bat is a valuable bench piece. He's been off to a rough start this year but I'm convinced that's partly due to him no longer getting regular playing time.
3621	That is like teaching how to bomb the white house!	I used to TEACH Linux. I'm boned.
3622	Yeah, I wish other companies would do this too, like MSFT, so we can get people off old and compromised systems.	I for one respect the fact that Google has taken it upon themselves to guide the "internet" where it needs to go. Up until now, no one has had the balls to do what needed to be done and everyone was content being complacent. We needed someone to be the bad guy and start trimming all the crap from the web. Google started last summer with NPAPI and now Flash, hopefully Java is next. Good riddance with the internet cancer I say.
3623	No but I kinda assumed it'd be there.	Did they confirm Hero Mode? Because that's a big thing I was hoping for.
3624	That's because they are smart and they work hard.	Asians actually get payed more per every dollar that a white person would make. Source: my economics textbook.

3634	yeah men are such pigs	Men since boyhood have been shown images of petite women saying that these women are hot so it's become a norm and that's why we all view them as attractive. Quick Summary: Men are just following the footsteps of other men.

3637	No no that's wiping get your terms straight, we don't want her contradicting her previous statements.	Deleted? Like with a cloth?
3638	Yes, people who think they are already the best version of themselves and have no more self improvement to achieve are quite self-aware.	This is exactly the reason I cringe when people say "I'm just being the real me" or "Don't let other people change you." These are just convoluted ways of putting yourself first.

3642	You've got to poke-rap it, otherwise there no point	721 pokemon memorised in order I've written a poem that helps me to memorise all pokemon in order. I can currently recite all 4 generations of pokemon in order from memory alone and am working on gen 5 and 6 now. Is there any interest in seeing this poem and/or me recording a video where I try to recite them all (perhaps blindfolded to prove legitimacy)?

3647	Because galaxies interact across the vast empyness of space a lot.	There is, actually. Antimatter galaxies would interact with regular galaxies (and intergalactic dust) in very predictable ways, producing very identifiable areas of gamma ray emission. We don't see any of that no matter where we look. It can't just be that the whole area is antimatter, or we'd see borders of gamma ray emission around that area. And it can't be that the whole sky is antimatter, because we're not on fire.

3655	We're not allowed to be offended - we're white remember?	Ok I get that this is a annoy this sub post but this is slightly offensive and I will probably get down voted into oblivion. I understand that there are people that turn it into a contest but people come here for help.
3656	Yes, a company that's made several other games, many of them successful, should go under because of a Kickstarter project that didn't go as planned, despite the fact that that is a well known risk of kickstarters	Kivkstarter is fine. Just this company that should maybe go under.

3659	They meant spring 2020	Is Capcom hoping we all forget about the promised Linux port? Look, I know not many people care about this, but Capcom announced awhile ago that we'd see a Linux port of the game in spring. They've missed that window (unsurprisingly) and we haven't heard a single word about it since the announcement. Are they just not going to make it and hope nobody notices? That's an okay strategy when it comes to me and school assignments but I really expect more from Capcom, this is ridiculous.
3660	At least we've got rid of all those immigrants	Well, as a UK voter who went for Remain, I'm honestly ashamed at my country. We're screwed.
3661	Because they've tortured all the nice guys out of their real life with their "leading on" and need to satisfy their relentless female itch to deny gentlesirs access to their sexy bits.

3668	Honestly who cares, they'll always buy a fucking shotgun on T-side anyway...	Why BOTs will NEVER be able to drop weapons. Many people are requesting for a system to get the BOT to drop their weapon, much similar to how interacting with them causes them to drop the bomb. The flaw with a system like this would be that when a player leaves, the BOT gets their own pool of money, separate from the player who disconnected, starting from $800 and building up. The BOT uses this money to buy utility and weapons for itself. Now here is the problem; currently, when the player who disconnected re-joins, he "destroys" the BOT's money pool and its items, and the reconnected player starts with basic pistol, and the money he would have received in the rounds that he missed. This means that with the requested system you could make the BOT drop his weapon, and if the player re-joins within a certain time you would effectively have a free weapon from the BOT's cash pile, plus the reconnected player will be able to buy one of their own. This has potential to be exploited for extra weapons, since you will have 6 players worth of economy indirectly. The only way I can see round this is only letting BOTs drop weapons they have picked up, but this still allows an effective extra weapon to be carried when the player re-joins. If anyone has another solution to this problem, please comment, as it would be nice to see some other opinions on this problem! It would otherwise be a great feature to the game, since you may control a BOT and want to save a weapon, which you cannot access currently unless you die yourself. TL;DR - BOT's buy weapon, BOT's drop weapon, player re-joins with lots of extra money and a free weapon from the BOT's money.
3669	Ah yes, because Cruz and Trump support the 2nd amendment, all their batshit insane things go away.	Don't worry, in November you can vote for Trump or Cruz instead of Hillary and forget this ever happened.
3670	Yes, how dare these people come into this subreddit and disagree with you!	This thread is overrun by liberals. The mod team seriously needs to become more strict and start banning liberals.
3671	Ikr, because the problem is the chat, not the people themselves	I would support removing the chat, that way people wouldnt spend the entire game typing insults to each other.

3676	Boo Spooked ya	If this gets 101 upvotes, I'll buy everyone a new Nintendo 3ds to go with their new copy of Sun &amp; Moon I saw the thread with the guy giving out copies of sun and moon. But what good is that if you don't have the console to play them on ? I will pick 101 winners later ! knock yourselves out by leaving a comment below after upvoting so I know who to message once the winners are announced.

To get around the doping issues they do these crazy blood transfusions with like a super blood concoction before the races. These uber rich people could very well be doing the same thing for longevity.
3679	Same with this PC tho?	If it were seen outside of a suitcase, sure. Otherwise just an altoids container.
3680	please tell me this is a joke	I'm gonna get downvoted for this I'm sure, but it's a dumb rule that's completely unnecessary in 99% of cases. How out of the loop do you need to be to need a label telling you that a game being featured is GTA5 or Fallout 4. It's understandable if the game is old or obscure, but that's not the case most of the time, so many of these gifs come from mainstream, AAA games that have come out in the past year, or have a billion other threads made about them every day. It's enforced spoonfeeding, that's all.
3681	I'm plenty late to the party, but correct me if I'm wrong, you cannot efficiently goblin knife at th8 because you don't have the jump spell?	Why are people downvoting this guy? Every single one of us had a moment when we learned what it was. This community is a place where people can ask questions, even if they are obvious. By downvoting beginner level questions, the community discourages anyone from asking questions. I've learned a ton from this sub and a lot of it was because of people answering questions like this. Goblin Knife is a farming or pushing strategy that focuses on getting a mass of goblins into the core of a base to quickly kill the TH and DE storage. Most successful attacks result in about 20% damage done, but a huge amount of DE stolen and a one star attack. This is accomplished by using 4-12 giants, some archers or goblins, and some wbs to create a funnel and break through the outer layer of the base. Then use a jump or quadquake to get to the core. Drop a few goblins to clear away any other buildings between the exterior and the core, then do a two finger drop to unload as many goblins as possible as fast as you can on a path to the core. Drop a rage and heal in the core and it's over. There are several good examples on this sub and on youtube as well as tips for making it work better. The beauty of it is that it works at every TH level from 8-11. It usually results in a one star win so you can maintain or even climb in trophies. It is a very very cheap army (requiring almost no DE) and trains fairly quickly. It often only uses 2-3 spells and your heroes usually don't take much damage. When you use it, try to look for bases that have the TH and DE storage close to each other. Note where the wiz towers/mortars/multi infernos are and avoid them or plan for them with heal/rage/freeze. Visualize the path the goblins will take to get to the core and make sure you clear any resource buildings that will lure the goblins away. Last, check for potential gb spots that could ruin the whole thing. With practice, you'll be wrecking fools in no time.
3682	God those cliche sailor boy costumes are hot tho...	Only difference between a sailor and a marine? The marine holds their own legs in the air.
3683	Yea but how much did the 970 release at	perhaps because the $970 can be had for $250? So it is not such a revolution as everyone expected.

3715	go away edgelord	Take nothing as truth. But this was more in reference to people that might have inside information on team rosters. It's actually really fucked up that people outside of the team say shit. A roster announcement is the first proprietary thing a team and its players own. It can be sold into, it can track metrics for sponsors, it can translate into real dollars for players. It can be a starting point for a brand to be built, it can be so many things but one thing its not is a platform for someone else to use. I understand there's no legal or contractual obligation to not speculate or leak or whatever. I'm just saying it's a selfish thing to do. Let teams announce their own business. They'll let you know when they're ready.

3725	Yeah, just terrible teams.	Yeah, Durant never had any help in OKC.
3726	when is dx12 becoming a standard tho, i hate having to run my 295x2 on one gpu -_-	Why you should he hyped for this year in PC gaming (if you aren't already) * DirectX 12 lets any GPU from any brand work together, removing the headaches Crossfire and SLI bring, and has enormous performance gains over DX11 * Vulkan finally replaces OpenCL making Linux gaming a viable option for everyday users if enough games start using it * AMD Zen will bring back AMD into the CPU space for gaming and hopefully balance market share * Polaris and Pascal are the first GPU die shrink since 2011 and bring Gen 2 HBM to replace GDDR5 * The first viable VR headsets launch * AMD launches its open source GPUOpen to combat Nvidia Gameworks * DDR4 becomes the new memory standard, replacing DDR3 * Windows 10 is the first Windows OS built with gaming explicitly in mind * PC as a platform grows massively as a mass exodus of console gamers switch to PC * The age of console exclusives ends, at least for Xbox One

3736	It was Heroes Unlimited and they changed it from a Major to a minor power.	Clock manipulation. Although seemingly useless, creative players can interpret it as being able to affect pacemakers and computers, because they use a time-based mechanism to function. I heard one game had this power, and changed it to a major power in a later edition.

3751	Yes because your Miranda rights aren't read out to you when arrested laying out your rights very clearly at all!	TLDR: Our policies aren't the problem, people should just be magically better informed about how to deal with our shitty police. No dude. Just no.
3752	no, because the government is special for some reason	It doesn't matter who is providing the internet access. If you lived in a country that censors the internet and your ISP decided to block a website would you be OK with that? They provide the internet access right?
3753	You are welcome	I know this post is old, but I just wanted to thank you for mentioning this. Recently did a re-watch of the series and wanted to watch the movie again. Ran down to BL per your suggestion, and bingo! I had to sift through about 150 randomized movies to find it, but worth it! I had forgotten how many great cameos are in the film. Thank you!

3756	I'm sorry but that was literally my motive, other things played into it, but that was the primary reason I bit the bullet.	I really don't think you can blame your delving into pornography on a lack of sex education. Sex ed more often than not initiates children into sex and makes them curious about it and it serves as the starting point for a lifetime of illicit sexual activity. Young children in general must be kept away from access to the internet. I wasn't allowed to use a computer with internet access unsupervised until I was 18, and by then I was already well-formed as a Catholic and wouldn't look at pornography. I knew that girls were anatomically different for as long as I can remember, but I didn't know the details until I was pretty old.

3764	Smith didn't produce propaganda for an oppressive, authoritarian theocracy.	I came to this sub looking for solidarity and comradery because if there's anywhere I can get away from the polarised nature leadership debates on Facebook for some constructive reasoning, it might be Reddit. This is the Labour subreddit, we shouldn't be trashing the leader of the party like this. I'd be saying the same if you were trashing Smith as well. Be critical but don't be over the top about this, comrades.

3767	Taking a digestive enzyme with ATP should help with this.	Always feel tired after eating Shall I just stop eating during the day? Today I felt great after having a protein and fat-based "meal" for breakfast. At lunch I decided to refrain from high-sugar foods and had yogurt plus blueberries (yes, some sugar) and a wrap. But even then I felt super tired. It seems no matter what I have for lunch, it always kills my productivity. Is it best to simply avoid it, maybe have some caffeine, and then eat later after work (i.e. avoid eating at work entirely)?

3772	Kids today, sheesh.	The lines are pretty clearly drawn. Trump and Clinton represent 2 very different points of view. Clinton is not a perfect candidate but her differences from Trump are stark. By counting the Trump voters in the fall we'll basically have an opportunity to see what percentage of the people in this country truly suck.

3786	Check for sore marks on her knees.	I have a clerical post. I sit in front of my computer and reek in money by doing nothing(I mean I do shit. But work load isn't that much, so most of the time I just sit there waiting for work to arrive) . Last year I got the assignment to train this girl. She got accustomed to the job, she was a rank lower to me(my junior). Her work was bad, she kept doing typos, spelling mistakes, late submissions, I mean if it was America, Trump would have **fired her.** But she was *good looking* and young. Earlier this year she got a promotion, she is now my senior(rank wise) . I have been sitting at this same chair for more than 2 fuckin years, she got promotion in less then a year. My job, what little I get to do, is spotless. I don't know who she gave a blowjob to, or who she fucked. But yeah... Fuck my life.

Maybe it's only a little thing to celebrate the 20th then will go away? Who knows, but one things for sure, they're paying a guy to keep up on it now.

3816	That's a nice "Make America Great Again" hat you've got on!	If he's a journalist he's a terrible one. Present an incredibly biased POV, present half the picture and call it objective truth, and whenever anyone criticizes your (lack of) journalistic integrity, you can come out with the "I'm not a journalist I'm a comedian!" excuse. If you wanted real news you could be reading Reuters, BBC, or one of the dozens of decent news sites, not watching John Oliver. It's okay to like John Oliver, he can be funny, but let's not pretend he's doing anything useful in terms of informing people--he just masturbates the leftist ego and arms leftists with talking points so they can argue more. Also Drumpf is a shitty unfunny meme, literally the second most childish thing this election to Trump talking about his dick.

3828	This is interesting, I had been wondering for a while what happened with that agreement.	We don't have to. Beijing considers all of this money to be proceeds of crime. About $1T USD has left the PRC over the last decade or so through "unofficial channels". Beijing has always held the stance that this money is forfeit. They've spent the last few years putting themselves in a position to do something about it. Canada has never had an extradition treaty with the PRC. They impose the death penalty, so Canada could never let itself be put in a position where we were *required* to surrender somebody who could be executed. China resolved this issue by signing a bilateral agreement with Canada to repatriate fugitives, waiving the death penalty. The other issue was that Canada has never been motivated to deal with inbound currency flows due to "money laundering". We're supposed to care - we've signed treaties to this effect - but the reality is that nobody ever turns down cash inflows. Beijing resolved this issue by signing an agreement with Canada, whereby Canada gets a 20% share of any seized assets. So now, Canada is motivated to participate. These were the steps that Beijing has had to quietly take in order to deal with this issue. Once the legal arrangements were resolved, Beijing dispatched teams of investigators to identify Canadian assets owned by Chinese citizens. This is called "Operation Fox Hunt". Canadian government officials acknowledge that this is going on, and what the purpose is, but other than that they don't answer any questions. China has spent years doing a lot of careful and necessary planning. Capital outflows have accelerated, reaching a level that's starting to freak everybody out, but they haven't made the slightest effort to slow it down. A year ago last July, PRC stock markets started a major meltdown. Beijing responded by imposing a six month ban on selling shares owned by major Chinese stockholders. Those rules were supposed to expire in January, but the stock market started to implode again in November, so they extended the rules again. Some time around July of this year, the rules will be replaced by permanent "market stability" rules, which are expected to ban sales of stocks. A huge amount of money is fleeing this disaster, and this is part of what is feeding the frenzy for offshore real estate. At the same time that it introduces the permanent rules, Beijing will need to close the escape hatch that's allowing all this capital to flee the country. They want to reclaim all this real estate, and all these bank accounts, but they have to do it in a way that's minimally disruptive. Some time this year - probably this summer - thousands and thousands of people will wake up to discover that Beijing has registered liens against their foreign real estate. When property has a lien against it, it cannot be sold until the lien is resolved. This allows an orderly unwinding of real estate holdings. The 20% share of profits ensures that Canada is happy. And Beijing gets to reclaim a massive fortune from people who are basically undermining attempts to foster domestic economic growth. They'll be shamed into surrendering huge assets to Beijing - because the alternative is being returned to the PRC to face corruption and money laundering charges. And everybody else lives happily ever after.

More likely they would just not vote, or vote libertarian.

Considering why they fought in the first place it's also pretty clear that OP was not a very good guy. I'm pretty sure if the sister was posting here we'd all be telling her to go no contact, file a restraining order, etc.

3872	You simply dress it up with *more* Chardonnay	OP tries her very best, but there's no real way to dress up $7 chardonnay hangovers. My Wednesday is ruined.
3873	or zoom out in map view and exit map view, works for me.	Thanks, I'll do that next time it comes up
3874	And of course, after the trebuchet, next comes the armoured car with machine gun firing; everyone knows that is the OP weapon :|	Damn... That was a sad read.
3875	The OF didnt even have the ball when he passed 3rd so he should be sent, even with the Castro non-wheels.	Wow, I would NOT have sent Castro there lol.
3876	I wouldn't fault Kikis too hard considering nobody on G2 looked good, plus they had all of the internal issues with Emperor and Hybrid so it's not fair to fault him too hard.	Gamsu did really well at IEM vs international top laners... meanwhile kikis at MSI....
3877	No, he really isn't...	Yeah but he's not op right guys????? Just learn to counter him right guys?!?!
3878	I'm not sure what you're getting at.	spoofing it in the app so you never have to move around is one thing. Spoofing it to gather API data for a location is another.
3879	man I'm pretty jelly those hoses looks sweet around there.. no to mention the table!	Playing pool while passing out the good stuff!
3880	Exactly.	So they're hipsters basically.
3881	That's quite possibly the most dangerous thing that a human can do.	Once I got a new video game and was too lazy to run and get scissors. I had short nails, so how the hell was I supposed to break open that annoying plastic wrap? I looked over to my large, fat cat gently sleeping in the corner of the couch. It then dawned on me. So i reached over and grabbed my cat's paw and squeezed, unsheathing her magnificent claws that I then used as a knife to open the packaging. It's my only and best MacGyver moment.
3882	Vegemite rules, peanut butter cups suck.	Reese's peanut butter cups are cheaply made. You can enjoy them, but it's like Australians enjoy yeast extract spread.

3884	Me either	I don't like this post :/
3885	"If the consumer learns what DRM is, we've already lost" --someone who's name I forgot	I'm willing to bet you 99.99% of consumers know nothing about yellow dot patterns though. These cartridges will be a little more obvious, but honestly with HPs shitty track record of official cartridge chip failure, I don't know that it'll be much different. It isn't lack of public concern, it's lack of public knowledge.
3886	If you're angry to the point of someone saying "hey calm down a bit" and you respond by yelling at them, yeah I'd say in a disproportionate response	So is anger/excitement NEVER an appropriate reaction? Calm down? How about you get excited!
3887	this reminds me when i was at pre-school *nostalgia*	"When I grow up, I want to be a Red engie"
3888	fucking typical EA...releasing 2 Brandon Marshall cards in teh same promo.	Partial List of AFC Players for 4th of July Promo revealed!
3889	Not sure what you mean?	wtf is wtf?
3890	To be fair, they call it a Eurostep even though Manu popularized it at he isn't European either	Yes. Also, Marv said Varejao embellished a foul using his "European skills." I didn't know Brazil was in Europe.
3891	No, if you were planning on getting divorced you shouldn't have started up a game	Yeah at the end of the day it's just a game, so when someone give an actual real life reason, it doesn't make me mad

3893	This sub is going to dick.	how is this funny?
3894	I guess cookie felt we needed to practice fielding double plays today since we've completed so few of them so far this season	Game thread? Where is the game thread? I need the game thread so I can bitch about these horribly hideous Royals-esque uniforms.
3895	Rumors are that he might do an independent bid (in order to tank Trump).	Romney lost, how is he relevent now?
3896	I have only read the synopsis of the movie and seen the trailer but for some reason seeing this poster makes me smile and cry at the same time.	I must protect that smile
3897	They have millions of emails of people who made donations, so even without a dnc list, I think they have a very good starting point for activism	Bernie Supporters' Email List -- After NV Convention, I'm wondering: Does the Democratic Party Own That List? Do the Bernie supporters' email list belong to him or the Democratic Party (the irony of their name,lol)? Whoever starts the third party or reforms a current one, needs that list. It would be a huge jumping off point if we had that list. I think everyone voting for Bernie just wants common sense policies that would benefit the country as a whole, and I think that's something 50%+ could rally behind (especially since so many of this great nation are independents).
3898	Chee-Wees are too oily	Omg you've never had Chee-Wees probably! Gasp! Its like the crispy cheetos but a teeny bit spicy because they're from New Orleans. THAT would make you change your mind lol
3899	THANK YOU!	Where's the "Warren G" comment? I came here for one thing and one thing only, and it isn't here.
3900	Ah, thanks :P.	not literally: but very well done (literally 'sa7tein' means "two healths'...)
3901	Dogs like "Screw cooking it drop that shit right in my bowl raw"	She knows daddy's making her one
3902	If Arch's install process is not to your taste, you could use Antergos or Manjaro to speed that part up.	Looking for a development distro Hey! I've been wondering for a while now: isn't there a "dev" distro? By dev distro I mean one that comes with `gcc`, `make`, `valgrind`, `gdb`, `vim`/`emacs` and `git` out of the box. I used to use Arch for this, but since we can all agree that the install process is not one of the fastest I want something that doesn't take ages to install. Any suggestion?
3903	Procrastination	What's the thing you are best at?
3904	And the bus is being driven by the Trump campaign.	She's being thrown under the bus right now. I'm not even convinced she's real.
3905	What is a Yinzer?	You must have been very fortunate in your encounters with Pittsburgh fans if you have not run into the all-too-large Yinzer "Fire Tomlin!" population. During the team's rebuilding years (when they go 7-9 or 8-8!) you'd think the entire franchise was so worthless it would be better if it were to gut the entire FO, coaching staff, and roster. Yinzers psychologically just can't handle a Steelers, Penguins, or Pirates team that isn't a conference favorite. They get their philosophy from Ricky Bobby: If you're not first, you're last!
3906	God damned height privilege.	Taller men and FT's: My (most likely incorrect) hypothesis. Sorry, I probably massacred that title. I'll try and explain myself. I've heard various arguments to explain why taller men suck at freethrows (at least, more than their guard peers). Big hands; awkward angles; strength; coaching towards being a rebounder etc... But, I haven't heard anybody simply suggest that taller men suck because, well, really and truly they have less competition, therefore it's easier to make it into the NBA as a taller man. Take the population 6'10'' or larger for example. We're talking less than 3200 people in the US being that tall. Who knows how many of those are even 20-40 in age. And in shape and not injury prone? Less than 2000 most certainly. Comparatively, Chris Paul at 6'0'' has had to hone his skills because there are millions of people that height working their asses off to compete with him. So, for a guard, you're really talking the cream of the crop in skill. There isn't going to be (other than the rare occasion) a guard in the NBA who can't shoot free throws at at least an acceptable rate. Capela (first one to come to mind as a Rockets fan) on the other hand only has about 2000 people to compete against. He can, due to his height being so critically important, suck at FT's because at least he's better than those other 2000. So maybe some big NBA players just innately suck at basketball. We all know people who can just straight shoot, and those who no matter how much training and coaching they get can't. If you're short, you can't make the NBA if you are the second type. But if you're tall, maybe you can, simply because there's not much competition anyway. Height is basically normally distributed, but only close to the mean. More than 4 standard deviations away, and the dropoff becomes rapid. As you go further out, the relative error becomes even larger. There really *aren't* many people 6'10'' or above. Each inch above 6'0'' shaves off many possible competitors. Kobe at 6'7'' for example, has 130,000 to compete against (again, who knows how many are 20-40, and even in good shape). Add 3 inches and you can divide that by 43! Thoughts?

3910	And I'm sure they go to r/politics and link posts from Breitbart.	"Summer Reddit" refers to the time when school is out and it becomes overrun by middle schoolers.
3911	that was the first thing i tried.	Disable HD 4000 in bios. It should be there saying use pci is Intel HD 4000. Pci express is your gpu. Mark that one

3913	If you can't keep your own house clean you have no right to criticize others.	Why Do Some Conservatives Criticize Donald More Than Hillary?
3914	They have to fear those mean death threat sending bullies from reddit, so it's important that they be 'inclusive' and make sure they show Diggle in their posts!	What do they have to fear? They have no face or name. They're just 'sittyolicityusersname' an Olicity picture.

3922	Bush's legs!	Hard to believe that around 10 years ago much of the chicken in out supermarkets was imported
3923	yes, all slavic people drink vodka continuously	Honest question: I watched the match today and taz had a bottle of water and a metal flask. Is he a drunk? I mean I'm not disparaging him if he is. I just never seen a flask pulled out during a major or anything like this.
3924	Is this shopped or what is up with her giraffe neck?	Selena Gomez
3925	I dunno, most microwave meals don't have literal shit in them.	it has all the quality of a store brand microwave meal so
3926	Well, your money, your choice.	I just mean like there is even more stuff inside the loot box, and with me not liking the summer skins I have less of a chance of me finding something I will like, thanks tho i'll just save my money till the event is over.
3927	Genius	I like to do this, but I place the ziploc bag on a small upside down plate to create a concave shape so the bags stack together easily and securely rather than possibly sliding around if you stack them horizontally.
3928	Its one of my favourite exotics at the moment SGA and the raid mg are the only heavies I use now, pfffft - forgot what the lmg reload animation is	is the super good advice perk good?
3929	Bickerstaff	What coaches are "unfireable?" I didnt think in a million years that Vogel and Jaeger would be fired, yet they were. That being said, who are the coaches that are in a position where it would take a whole lot for them to he fired?
3930	Sounds like your version of the TV License.	I actually know what you mean... I find it an issue here in Denmark. DR (our BBC) feels less and less impartial to me and they receive huge amounts of money over taxes (not really taxes, but that's the easiest way to describe it). Taxing would be illegal, so we call it by a different name and if you own neither a TV, computer, smartphone or any other electronic device with internet access you get to not pay. Robbery is a better word than tax honestly
3931	Mom of the year right there.	This kid drove over from PA with his mom to buy a supercharged bonneville from my lot. He said he had been in two accidents in the past year. So he test drove it, with me inside and I can see why he got in wrecks. Looks quick, whips it, then signals to get over after he's already over. He 'shot the gap' abunch with out signaling and with quick hasty movements. I almost didn't wanna sell him such a nice car. It was a rally nice low milage bonneville ssei, 240 hp in the thing. This was more than a year ago. He probably wrecked it already.
3932	So weird, I didn't hear that Jill Stein had dropped out...	gary johnson, who is 3% away from joining the general election debates, is the only candidate who supports legalizing marijuana
3933	That should hopefully be squashed at the next patch.	Solo players also get the advantage of never seeing glitched AI weapons too.

3935	You dropped this:	Pretty much
3936	yea he also should have asked for her permission to say hi	Why else would i give her a hard time. Cos shes fat?
3937	Too soon!	Happy Overwatch release day! Happy Overwatch release day!
3938	T-shirts so you can give free marketing to a company whose product was shit.	They've been bad for a while. I have had several infected bottles of BCBS, and I tossed all the empties. Not gonna hold on to a bunch of empty bottles in hopes that GI will do refunds again. I also don't really care. They sent me way more money and t-shirts than they were supposed to from the Coffee and Barleywine, so I nearly evened up on what I spent anyway.
3939	People use their phones whoa this is news.	The smartphone has become the center of our political lives
3940	Yep, becoming an alcoholic is so much better.	So I guess they aren't a fan
3941	Our sun is dying and has been dying since it was ignited, fire will be what kills the Sun.	The SUN legendary will be WEAK TO FIRE yeah it makes complete sense.
3942	You guys are really making me want to watch this movie now!	And the editing.
3943	The thing is the game client sends device ID, unofficial API requests shouldnt include it afaik	I don't know, if the scanner doesn't use the phone ID then its probably a hard coded value, would be very easy to identity for niantic (maybe I'm wrong and you can generate a random) my point is if they want to find a main account I think they can
3944	That's very strange, but alright, close enough I suppose	Black friday not cyber monday, cyber monday had item sales
3945	This is so original how did you come up with this?	I hope tomorrow we all can wake up, have a normal day, and go home and go to bed... Without me winning the lottery.
3946	We	WE HAVE THE BEST SHITPOSTERS, FOLKS! DO WE LOVE OUR SHITPOSTERS??
3947	Well, I guess you get both with HRC?	I vote for competency not how loud they can yell
3948	You forgot the	If the Colts called and offered you Luck for Newton, the Panthers would take it in a second
3949	They refuse to even consider him for a vote due to his scandalous associations - he was once seen with the President of the United States, after all.	I feel really bad for him. This is the opportunity of a lifetime in his profession, and the Senate is stalling based on petty, unecessary reasons.
3950	You forgot the	Racism = prejudice + power She wasn't being racist
3951	Twin Lakes, Wisconsin?	Where I come from it's called "Country Thunder" and it's mainly 14 year old girls hooking up with anyone who will hand them a beer.

3953	We're not presently at war, might as well get rid of the military as we have no current use for it	Defending our NATO allies from what aggression? The original members that existed in 1990 are in no danger from any threat.
3954	Sure man, same as they'll ban Microsoft and Google because they do not apply the European standards of data safety.	If Niantic doesn't react they risk Pokemon Go being blocked in Germany due to several privacy violations, consumer protection investigates/"attacks". German Link.
3955	The officer had to have been getting a contact high from his odor, like when they start to get intoxicated from a drunk person's breath.	They obviously smelled weed, hell I can here in my room!
3956	Yeah, PCOS is thought to both cause weight gain and be a consequence of weight gain.	PCOS - it causes insulin resistance, in turn jacking up the metabolic functions. I was told I had to take birth control for cramps, but none of the doctors ever thought to mention any of the other effects. I found out after my friend mentioned some reality TV show and asked if i had the same thing.
3957	Thaphireth	Math Effect
3958	Hamilton leading the championship....	Now that we are halfway through the season, what are some of the season's biggest surprises to you? I asked this over on r/IndyCar and got a wide range of responses and I'm hoping to get the same thing here. It really gives you an idea of how many things there are to pay attention to over the course of a season. Here's a few of mine: * rise of Verstappen/fall of Kvyat * Kimi being ahead of Seb in the driver's standings * financial limbo of Sauber What other surprises have there been, in your opinion?
3959	Rumor has it that he thought of donating a plate of cookies, then stepped back.	McCrory probably disapproves.
3960	Sadly, no, we sold the ones he still had left to pay for the unique coffin, which was chair shaped.	You wouldn't happen to have any pictures of his chairs?
3961	"I'm pansexual" Well anything you can get you won't turn that down, wonder why	Trashy Tinder Teen (x-post from r/Tinder)
3962	Lol now he'll come around.	Pyro's hit registration is more broken than you think it is! (From b4nny's live stream)
3963	You're aware JFK died before we went to the moon right?	You are aware that it was President Kennedy that began the Apollo missions to the Moon, right?
3964	Who pulled the trigger?	Queens imam and his assistant shot to death by gunman in attack, local Muslims blame Donald Trump: 'His drama has created Islamophobia'
3965	He's playing 3D Donalds and Dragons	Why is he doubling down? Did anybody listen to Limbaugh or Hannity today? Even they couldn't find a good way to explain this away.
3966	Its like they know what's going to happen...	Wish the BBC commentators would STfU for a second
3967	Because three more days will change it from unfinished to perfectly polished right?	3 day delay vs an unfinished game...
3968	Montana too	There are a shit load of Welsh and Irish in the Appalachians period. We tend to look alike, maybe it's the inbreeding.
3969	So many hours spent on Insaneaquarium...	Anything made by popcap before EA got their hands on the company was gold. Zuma, Peggle, Insaneaquarium and Bejeweled - such a shame to see the company die a horrible death. Can't play a game of theirs without micro transactions or some shitty money element plugged in.
3970	i would've loved to see fucking batman making quips	Joss Whedon's BATMAN! DEVELOPMENT HELL
3971	I think I'll do Techno Viking.	I call dibs on "all your base".
3972	Corsair 400C	What's the best looking &amp; performing sub-$100 case you can think of?
3973	Das sind bestimmt auch die Leute die sich auf GAR KEINEN Fall Aufzeichnungen auf Youtube anschauen und alles nur Live anschauen	Ist ja oke dass man Twitch bevorzugt, aber ein paar Leute haben geschrieben dass sie die Rocketbeans dann nicht mehr gucken wenn sie auf Youtube sind. Sowas verstehe ich halt gar nicht.
3974	Scraps of the flesh of the formerly rich you mean...	The problem is if we don't do something about it (i.e. a basic income) we are quickly going to end up in a hellscape where 30% of people are unemployed and living off literal scraps.
3975	Yeah, but they banned Milo, so Twitter's curbing harassment.	Those Twitter replies are disturbing.
3976	Cheese Land on original GBA	What is your favorite track, purely based on aesthetic/look? Purely based on looks, not actual track. For me, it would have to be a tie between Ribbon Road or Animal Crossing Winter. What about you guys?
3977	But then you missed the awesome free style rap in the center of it!	I turned it off after about 45 seconds, I didn't like it or hate it, I was too ambivalent to keep listening.
3978	Ofcourse, I can jam 26 humans into a mono-white vial list, but it won't be DnT, and being human or not doesn't really matter there anyways.	Looking at Sean Brown's DnT list 5/8 creatures in mainboard are humans, upped to 7/10 if you include the sideboard. If you equate Serra Avenger to Craterhoof, Revoker to Dryad Arbor, and Flickerwisp to Symbiote, you literally have a discrepancy of one card. Then we do the same trick with Eldrazi, which also has zero tribal synergy effects.
3979	Yes because everyone here is totally responsible and planned the attack.	So Jim Sterling's site was DDOS'D because of their No Man's Sky review.. Why? Like I get some of you are salty that it got a 5/10, but do some of you have to be such fanboys as to DDOS someone you disagree with?
3980	Stab gobs would be a good replacement imo	The famous hog-poison cycle deck Question Hello. I would just like to get some opinions about a change i thought of for this deck (Hog, Cannon, Musketeer, 1 elixir skelly's, valk, zap, pump, poison). So i know the main point of the 1 elixir skeletons is just to cycle quicker to the hog while providing decent distraction potential, however, since this deck has a pump and 3.4 elixir average, wouldn't it be smarter to replace the 1 elixir skeletons with Guards? The average would be 3.6, but still, with a pump, that's very low. And the guards would be much more effective at taking out hog riders/royal giants since they can soak up a zap and be just fine. Thoughts?
3981	he shouldn't be worry then...easy fight, right eddie?	Alvarez: it baffles me that Khabib is no. 1 contender
3982	Clearly the throws he made were all easy	How is Dallas's backup QB Prescott not on this list? Dude went 10/12 with two drops for 139 yards and two TDs!
3983	WHat if Scott sends us a link?	Change your password immediately, do not open any links sent to you 1. Change your password right now, something you have NEVER used before 2. Do not open links from any user, not even users you trust, as their account may be compromised Nothing to panic about, just be careful guys
3984	Dude, you obviously just don't like him because he's such a positive dude, and you're just a negative nancy and will probably blow your brains out.	Dustin comes in strong with the ass kissing. Dick mentioned he had a salesman like persona, and it's true. And what is a salesman? It ain't Mr. Positive as he eluded, it's bullshit artist. And while I too was amused by the story, Dustin really laid it on thick with the "GOD, that was fucking good" and "that was fucking incredible". Go re-listen to it Dustin; you lack any authenticity for your brown nosing. If you're going to suck some Dick, do it with more energy or don't do it at all. And while I'm on the topic, what is this "WE should have a new patreon goal." What's your stake here? Aren't you just the hall monitor who brings in stupid questions from FB? I guess it annoys me this time because both Tshuwaan and Dick were like "I don't get it?" Bullshit, you both would get it if you would be a little objective. But I guess you enjoy having your salad tossed and can't think straight. Otherwise, good show. I did feel like Mr. Velvets rage topic was pretty weak. Both Schon and Dick crashed on it pretty hard. It felt like they faked some agreement as to not be dicks, but I'd rather they just shit on his weak rage topic. Ipads on the Elvis tour? Who gives a shit.
3985	Voting for Obama is a vote against Hillary, you misogynist.	Ah. Yes. I'm part of the "extreme right wing". You know, the "extreme right wing" of atheists who voted for Obama in 2008.
3986	That's sexist!	When i think of blowjobs, i think of women giving them. Obviously thats different for others
3987	You forgot the	Natalie and Michelle HOH? I'm okay with that.
3988	Yes, obviously something is wrong with all of Japan because of this incident.	What the fuck is wrong with japan
3989	I love you.	What's the dumbest thing you've said out loud?
3990	Hahah	The Wallabies were the team in Yellow. Just encase you mixed up the team playing well with the team that was on the receiving end
3991	get a horse.... have fun	As someone who hasn't played Battlefield in years, the average Bf4 gif on this sub makes me very nervous to what will happen to me when I jump on the BF1 beta.
3992	Because we're the best team ever in any sport , duh	I was at that game at FedEx. I turned to my wife as they were about to kick, said watch Cowboys will fuck this up. Damn it, someday I don't know why I am stillCowboys fan.
3993	I bet she's evolved on her position on FGM.	Someone read the article. You would think Huma writing a paper about the glories of female genital mutilation would get the feminists in an uproar, but no, somehow being brown trumps the mutilation of young girls. Feminism is a cancer.
3994	My source says they are going to be the Cruiserweight and 3-man tag championships.	McMahon and Bryan to reveal two new championships on SmackDown Live tonight!
3995	LIKE VENOM MINE SOMBRA IS WIDOW'S SISTER CONFIRMED	well i am TRIGGERED! ! ! ! ! ! !
3996	Different attitudes I guess.	I'm an aggressive driver and I recognize it but maybe 1/4 times people actually move when I flash my high beams. Laying on my horn for a solid 10 seconds maybe gets 1/3 of the people out of my way, but that's still less then half the time that people don't understand what the fuck they are doing. I seriously want to get a LED sign that says mirrored, "Move Right Asshole".
3997	Fucking edgy aren't you?	Yeah it seems silly. It seems like they made ads specifically aimed to make us feel like pirating is immoral, but they never stopped to think about whether or not we gave a shit about morals. If I want something and I can get it for free and with virtually zero risk, you bet your sweet and sour ass I'm gonna take it.
3998	First person animations are just far too immersive	Why are Titanfall 2's Titan-entering animations in 3rd person? All of the animations that happen when you enter your Titan in Titanfall 2 are in 3rd person, instead of Titanfall 1's first person animations, which looked much cooler. Why, Respawn?

4009	no, im pretty sure it was recursion	Refactor?
4010	Get outta here with your logic and reasoning, they're too sound.	Kasich suspending his campaign invalidates like 90% of the news cycle's discussion in how Trump secures the nomination as well as the tension about whether or not the republicans would be going to a contested convention, which would almost assuredly be riotous. Kasich dropping out is a massive turn around for the Republican race, because it essentially means Trump is confirmed as the nominee. Sanders on the other hand wins 6 more delegates a state that Hillary didn't campaign in. If Sanders won by 70 or 80% that is maybe news, but his small victory doesn't change the nature of the race.
4011	Well, let's be fair here... He TOTALLY has like 1.5 arms...	One-armed MMA fighter Nick Newell Becomes XFC Champ.
4012	Yeah the massive fucking power plant couldn't be moreefficient than a car engine	lol, until the grid runs off zero-carbon emissions power, electric cars are NO less environmentally friendly than gas powered cars. It's amazing how good politicians AND CEO's have gotten at distracting the foolish masses
4013	Because fucking your ex is ALWAYS a good idea...	Dont burn bridges with youre exes
4014	KILL IT WITH FIRE, ITS SO UGLY OMG	New sick black market "Valkyrie" for Battery Specialist
4015	I'll carry you to the lighthouse if you send $60 to my Paypal.	Don't know, I avoid trials nowadays coz I suck so badly, haha.
4016	not scanning, but connect them with a objective data (building collapsing)	To what experiment are you referring? The experimental process of scanning the numbers in a book presupposed to be divine and comparing them to significant dates?
4017	After the hair/makeup I mistook the creeper FOR my mother in law	Omg. I wonder if this would work on my mother in law?
4018	My roommate has a japanese style bed that sits on the floor i only ever hear when shes moaning loud enough to hear through walls	Can anyone recommend a bed frame that won't make it sound like I am murdering an orchestra of accordion players every time I have sex? Sorry if this isn't the right place for this question, but I couldn't think of a better spot. Is this a common problem? I have a decent box spring/mattress set, but am using a cheap metal and spring frame underneath. The racket is ridiculous when my girlfriend and I get going.. Anyone have any tips for solving this? Any good rules of thumb to solve it? I see a lot of wooden slat bed frames, higher quality spring frames, etc. out there, but no idea what typically works best.
4019	yeah, only idiots would expect everything to work properly if they bought a new car.	They are advertised as the ultimate driving machine, not the ultimate blinking machine. they can't be expected to do everything.
4020	Free speech, like the invisible hand, is a race realist and will run away from **da blakz**.	Reddit irl
4021	But...but... Free college and healthcare will save this country	That's because he's losing and no one is paying attention to him. Once everyone finds out he wants their paycheck he will tank.

4023	The back side of the Ottawa Airport is a very hostile environment which closely mimics operational conditions	Glad to see the TAPV can run thru 10cm deep puddles
4024	I think yall are racists against people from Karim.	Lautrec set Is it just me or does the set of Lautrec from DkS1 seem kinda fat and ugly in Dark Souls 3?
4025	Poor people don't deserve hobbies.	Really not at all true. A) try finding a minimum wage job that will give you 40 hrs. It's pretty hard. They like to keep everyone part time. B) if you live in Norcross instead of the city, you must own a car, pay for gas, maintenance, insurance is another 100 a month. If you're making about 1100 before taxes and still required to eat and see a doctor from time to time. Oh and cloth yourself and maybe enjoy an inexpensive hobby after work?
4026	Yeah.. cause LeBron would have such a tough time if he was on the spurs, warriors, blazers, thunder, clippers....	Free pass to the finals. Now time to lose. Hopefully some day the nba will remove conferences and give us a real competitive show to watch.

4031	What phone is that?	The 1080 post that PCMR really wants to see
4032	I use the terms libertarian left and authoritarian left, personally.	I prefer the term Neoprogressives or anything but liberal. I fall into the liberal left myself, but I really do think that modern neoprogressivism, which is probably what you refer to as "liberals" these days, are far from holding liberal ideals.
4033	Thanks for making my day internet stranger!	That joke was amazing! You are hilarious, and have many friends in real life.
4034	What a great link that makes this exact argument	Roberta Lange reported to be uncommitted superdelegate who put Clinton over the top
4035	But doing this one super weird trick helped a few strangers online, so it must work for you!	i have chronic migraines and i post about it occasionally on facebook because it's something that affects my life to, sometimes, a severe degree, and because i pretty much only have family and fairly close friends added. but because i'm open about it, half of the people feel the need to send me links about how to "cure" my migraines. stuff like it's electronic screens causing them, or i should get a certain ear piercing because it's an accupuncture point (one friend would not let up on this until i told her flat out that i wasn't going to do it), etc. tonight i just got something about being in a migraine trial that looked completely hokey. i *know* people mean well, but i have a doctor, i know how to do and *have* done my own research, it shouldn't be annoying because they just want to help but i just want everyone to stop
4036	I'm not really familiar with that one	The one that has two people singing in harmony in a minor key with really sludgy guitars. Something about a hole, or a rooster, or drug addiction; that song of their's really features it.
4037	I'd rather buy an oven	How well does a 480 run? Not the new one. A guy is offering me his old 480 for shipping costs. Will it run better than Intel HD?
4038	Well, it's nice to know that they leave all of that behind when they emigrate to Western countries.	As an Arab, I must agree. Most of our countries are, sadly, incredibly misogynistic. Foreign women should stop visiting because, seriously, if they get screwed they will receive no justice. It's unfortunate but it's the reality.
4039	Thank you for your wisdom, genius.	Ugh This is fake
4040	BECAUSE TRUMP IS A RACIST, MISOGYNISTIC, FUCKING WHITE MALE!	How is this rage? He made a remark and turned out to be correct on it
4041	Well, we know they're all gonna!	And how many of them used them to kill people?
4042	OK LEAVE THEN LOL	i cant tell.
4043	Yep.	LOL so apparently calling out something now is hating. Is this what SJW has become, anything that isn't "POSITIVE VIBES DUHDE" is hating?
4044	We have the privilege of supporting rapists.	"*Is the child's father obligated to pay child support* **even though he is a victim of statutory rape**" "*We conclude* **he is liable for child support**" So about that male privilege?
4045	Well I guess this proves that gun bans work?	'UK man' tried to kill Trump: court papers
4046	That's an amazing stat considering this game is dying so fast.	Congratulations to the SMITE YouTube Channel on attaining 900,000 subscribers! And it's still growing. Just a testament to how far this game has come. 900,000 Subs and it's doing fantastic! One of the best communities that I know of (Except for the occasional Toxic person). GG SMITE. You da real MVP &lt;3
4047	Yes but Apple perfected it	There are quite a few email apps that already do this.
4048	idk man the gameplay has been getting better but I feel like the community's just shrunk so much since the launch was so bad on PC that probably contributes to a lot of the matchmaking problems.	Damn it, are you cursed?
4049	I guess we are going to have this sort of post every single trading day now :(	FTSE 100 closes above pre-Brexit level So much for the Remain scaremongering
4050	No this is just a character, see he's so immersed in the hardvapour narrative you don't realize this is all constructed.	David Russo's Drunken Rampage (The Owner of Dream Catalogue)
4051	No, you can just see all the sun's craters is all	Is that the moon superimposed over a sunrise? WTH.
4052	Yes That's what I meant	allowing the american people to speak isnt weakness, its proper representation. this is clearly a difference of opinion. some people want dictators, some want representatives.
4053	I like to shorten it to "slut"	"Friendzoning female." That's a funny way to spell "Bitch who thinks she should have a say in who she dates."
4054	Same place I keep your sister.	mounted in the bed
4055	The gym is just one way to be fit, i think those people have trouble getting any exercise because gym is one of the easiest!	going to the gym won't necessarily reduce your weight and some people don't like working out in a gym (I'm fit and I've never been to one)
4056	Has the money, why not?	What do you need SLI 1080 for?

4058	Obviously Genji cause Ninja and stuff	If you could have any Overwatch character's ability IRL, what would it be?
4059	Irony of it.	Looks like the work of an arsonist...
4060	Have the venue staff call the police	Ok, and what do you do when he comes anyway? Offender clearly doesn't care about who is or isn't invited, is basically crashing already. Call the cops, security? Making a scene at the event seems to make this selfish person's actions into a much bigger part of a wedding day than it should be. I admit it's not satisfying, so downvote away, but I'm curious how another response would be more effective.
4061	That's jawsome.	I use to want to grow up looking like my toys; thought "*this is what I'm supposed to look like as an adult*." Then one day I realized the hard truth... I'm never gonna look like a Street Shark.
4062	Honestly I'd fancy Adelaide over GWS	Does that mean that if you put a 1:1:1:1 on Sydney, GWS, Geelong and Hawthorn as long as one of them won you'd be ahead? Those are odds I'd seriously consider.
4063	I know ... I like the smell.	Now that the hot weather is approaching
4064	He started out strong, then he whipped out the pseudoscience like it was nothing.	This guy says that regular water will not hydrate you because it's too clumpy, but he'll sell you the right water...
4065	I sont think gay people should be allowed to live.	See, you were honest, and he was honest. But you were the asshole.
4066	I thought she was criticising the other party for using the courts to get her money.	But... she ***didn't*** rely on the legal and courts system... at all. She literally ignored them. She did the grown up version of sticking her fingers in her ears and yelling "Na Na Na Na I can't hear you!"

4068	Oh, right.	It never rains in Winter.

4070	No	Do you guys like Chihuahuas?
4071	I think calling them "meter maids" is a bit fucked, no?	Is it just me, or... ...have the meter maids been **really** on their game in Southside as of late? I've gotten three parking tickets in the past six weeks. Never had a ticket before then. And I don't think I'm the only one, given that I counted ten ticketed cars on the way to the UAB shuttle this morning. Anyone else noticing this? Or have any idea what's going on?
4072	Woosh	Getting dragged away by cops while fighting for civil rights 50 years ago. Hillary Clinton is literally under investigation by the FBI.
4073	Nerf Popcap	Everything is OP
4074	Where is Vince McMahon when you need him	I also just want to add, I think GGG is too polite to do it but I would love if he got into the ring like Adonis did after the last Kovalev fight and got in Canelo's face. "Canelo. Hermano. Yo quiero my belt. Give me my belt. You say give you gloves. Amigo. Here are gloves. For you. Let's fight. I want my belt."
4075	Constructive argument...	lol
4076	They defended trump too and still got downvoted?	""Slavery is only ok when non whites do it" - BLM" "Yea, because BLM totally supports what this guy did!"
4077	what was your old account?	I lost my password to the previous Reddit account. Sorry you were unable to account for that unfortunate problem of mine.
4078	What do you reckon constitutes an outplay then	w33 played excellently in the series, I'm simply saying that the game 3 laning phase was more Sumail choosing the wrong skill build than getting outplayed. Is that really that controversial of an opinion?
4079	THAT IS PERFECTLY OKAY AND YES YOU KIND OF DO IT'S SORT OF THIS GREAT THING	POSTAGE MIGHT TAKE A WHILE, ALSO NOW I NEED TO GET BACK TO NN1 DAMN IT.
4080	SOMEONE MAKE A GIF OF THIS	The best piece of Olympic broadcasting ever aired
4081	huh	He was born in Pakistan, therefore he is not from USA. (Zai could have moved there, and he would still be from Sweden, for example) Pretty sure you would be hated if you say that all illegal immigrants that live there are from USA as well.
4082	Ok maybe I'm too naive	I wish it was true that kids dont take things to the extreme and kill other kids over stupid silly things like girls or drugs.. I wish this was that kind of world... A very quick google search puts up 19 million cases just in the USA in the last 5 years showing that isnt the case..,,.
4083	'fad' .... being true since socrates is now a 'fad'	Ugh, this social constructivism fad needs to die out already.
4084	Going to McDonalds for a salad is like going to a hooker for a hug.	I agree. My point is that the article is nothing more than an ad. Where is the science proving this food is healthy? You'd think a salad would be heathy, but McDonald's salads, for example, are worse for you than their burgers, containing more calories and fat. This "healthy" food could be loaded with calories and fat. If this article wanted to be taken as more than an ad, they would have put in the calorie counts, fat, etc.
4085	I wish Franken were younger, he'd be a great choice if we could run him 2024.	It will probably be Kaine, even though he isn't a great choice (he doesn't seem particularly inspiring, is on the older end of things, and is openly pro-TPP). If I was Hillary, I'd be looking more at Al Franken, Eric Garcetti, Cory Booker, and Chris Murphy.
4086	Maybe the issue here is that the victim's last name is White and it isn't clear if the punch was intended for a white person or rather someone named White.	I guess it's only a hate crime if white people do it
4087	Yeah it takes thorins analysis to figure out that that lineup consists of 4 players of the old LGB lineup	Based off Thorin's analysis.
4088	At least one felony murder charge, coming up	"Gates stayed at the scene after calling 911. She was taken to Gwinnett County Police Headquarters for an interview and placed under arrest. She is charged with armed robbery but police said additional charges are possible. She remains in custody at the Gwinnett County Jail."

4090	How to identify the touch panel version?	I downgraded the firmware on my original phone and it did not help. In the first thread, most of the affected phones had touch panel version 5446_0x83_0xbd. I too had this version and had problems. On my refurbished phone, I have a different version and no problems. Asus support would not acknowledge that the firmware update broke the touch panel, but all was fine before the update so it is clear to me that the firmware was to blame. Open a ticket with Asus support, or if you are lucky enough to have an Asus support center near you go to it. At this point I don't think there is much you can do on your own.
4091	MJ never did anything less than 150%	I don't think anyone can question how heavily he coasts in like 75% of regular season games. He shows up against KD and Me7o and stuff during pnersonal matchups, but he plays at like 70% during the regular season. And he has to, unquestionably. if he went finals-mode all season there's no question his injury history would look different.

4096	How would they be able to tell their whispers then?	Speaking of the little birds, I was surprised they could talk.
4097	So doea this mean Mercer can consume Hulk now?	Just because we never see a character do something doesn't mean we can't make educated guesses about what they CAN do. This is mostly in response to a recent post talking about Saitama Vs. Sayajin saga vegeta and Nappa, and exactly how hard he would have been splattered. While I'll admit that he may have not been able to beat a character that has casual planet-busting power (casual in the sense that vegeta did not need to strain himself much to blow up a planet), the idea that he couldn't tangle with Piccolo and the other confirmed Moon-busters is kind of a ridiculous one. At no point in the OPM series are we given a situation where Saitama would need to blow up the moon (or something as large as it). He does effortlessly destroy a massive, city-wide meteor, and between this, the moon jump, and his ability to (again, effortlessly) redirect an attack that would wipe the surface of the earth, it is not even a stretch to consider that he could blow up the moon if he so desired. Along with that let's just go ahead and settle this right now: I can use whatever version of a character I so desire In a given battle. No form of the media is "More Canon" than any other, that's a bullshit argument. If I want to acknowledge that Anime Saitama deflected a Planet-busting attack vs. A planet-wiping attack, I will, but the distinction is mostly moot.

4100	Well 99% of the SJW,liberals, Sanders &amp; Clinton supporters say he is not a politician.	Trump's a politician. That means, by default, he's going to fuck things up for people. He'll be no better than Obama, who's no better than Bush the Second, who was no better than Clinton, and so on.

4106	No this mayor got kicked out of the Apple HQ for trying to meet with them to demand more money.	And you should watch the fawning circle jerk that was the city council meeting where Jobs went for approval on the spaceship plans. Those guys are enamoured with Apple. This is a PR whine. Is the mayor up for reelection, I wonder.
4107	I loved that level, it was so fucking crazy	To add to that: the prison level in hotline miami 2. fuck that shit. Barely got past *even with invincibility/infinite ammo*. The level after that was equally retarded. Didnt play the game since launch, because fuck that
4108	if only there were another candidate, who hasn't actually conceded yet and smashes Trump in the polls	They did not recognize her as the weakest candidate. All this time Sanders was working as a lightning rod for her. She was effectively flying in his wake flow because the focus was entirely on Trump and Sanders with Sanders being the main target where for anti dem outlets. Now that Sanders has effectively gone down in flames, largely because of the democratic parties actions. All the search light, anti air guns and attention is turning onto Hillary. And to their delight they find out she's made out of wet paper tissue. She's dropping like a rock EVERYWHERE, she's blundering terrible all the time and the more attention she gets the worse it becomes.
4109	Well obviously we need a registry of all trucks and we need to only allow people licenced to drive them	What alarms me is the fact that he's demonstrated to the world that any wacko with a murderous agenda, **any wacko**, can go to a U-Haul rental place, put down fifty bucks, and kill dozens of people. There's absolutely no way to stop it.

Don't get me wrong he's evil and hopefully rotting in hell, but that fucker knew how to purge and make it seem like he was doing the morally right thing. It was far easier to hide the truth in 1979 than it is today. So, if Erdogan did stage this then he's got purging down to a science.

Lol! Pro rape! Because the prosecutor and judge didn't want to let a rapist walk free! Amazing how little rational thought you guys put into your opinions.

4128	I don't think Kyle would be comfortable having a tank of flammable liquid on his back	What is even the point of this? Jetpacks will never be viable until we make advances in fuel technology. Strapping 5 gallons of gasoline to your back just doesn't make sense. I'm pretty sure its currently impossible to create trust using a battery, unless you use propellers, which would have to be ridiculously fast, or obnoxiously huge to lift the weight of a human.

4156	I started watching since 2014, and I think Blizz could do more for Esports, they didn't support enough.	The issue i find with the competitive scene is that it feels forced. Take the dota competitive scene for example, it is born from people wanting to compete and people wanting to spectate and then it got bigger and bigger. In hots (while i like the game) feels like blizzard is trying to create a scene just by throwing money at it and hoping people will want to compete and to other people to watch (here is the tricky part), feels un natural. I am ready for the downvotes.

This is the sort of thing you'd laugh at we 'Muricans for... How does it oppress *you* for a Muslim woman to wear a modest bathing suit? Is it because you can't ogle their bodies? Seems more oppressive to me to force Muslim women to either violate their beliefs or not go to beaches at all. This whole thing is ridiculous.

4182	not salty at all about Lindsay choosing me and then changeing to brick	Season 1: Mission 1 - The Rebellion Approval Welcome back everyone. I am pleased to say... Anne Maria, Brick and Heather will be going on the mission! So now I need those three to tell me wether they approve the mission, or fail the mission. Approving is what members of the Rebellion must do. The Spies have the option to approve it and make it seem like they are working with us, or fail it, giving themselves the upper hand. You 3 have a big decision to make. Are you ready to resist?

4188	While his team was up by 20+, what an asshole	Oh man, Steph disappeared in the fourth again.
4189	Doesn't matter, I don't want to pay for it regardless	I'm male and haven't impregnated anyone yet but I am for hearing rational debate about abortion. Like at what point does a fetus become a human, and other questions.
4190	I'd say unless you are a judge, you aren't in a position where you are capable of making that decision.	They don't need permission. Why on earth would they need to ask for it? That is absolutely nowhere in the law or precedent as it applies to media. It would in theory have been incumbent on Bubba Clem to secure permission to preserve the recording at issue. He was sued for that. He settled. The issue should have been dead then. But the paltry settlement in that case makes clear this was a shakedown of Gawker for being Gawker.
4191	Riot is great at buffs and nerfs, really are.	Swain has the Highest Winrates for both Top &amp; Mid, at 60% and 58% respectively. I think we overbuffed him guys.

4202	Pop is decreasing if anything...	The maturation of Vengeance of Azeroth Many people who follow this sub reddit are quite familiar with Vengeance of Azeroth, not all by having tried it but more from a flogging notoriety it has gained over the last 20 months since its' release. A lot of criticism has been leveled against it - some valid and a lot really not worth the conversation or hate that ensued. In fact, from the context of a lot of the criticism from some people, it would look like they haven't even really given the server a shot. When VoA first launched in September of 2014, I started playing there and stuck around for well over a year - having experienced it, I was (am) very familiar with the issues with the server: quest issues, class issues, instances, community, development speed and stability / security. Having said that, I'd like to take a couple minutes and compare then and now. Note that I am "re-experiencing" the server in its entirety by rerolling on the new PvE server (Stonetalon). Quests: If you look back through the bug tracker, you will find countless quests that once were bugged are now working as intended. So far until level 30 now, I have experienced 1 quest bug (A dip in the moonwell). The experience with quests to this point has been fantastic (kudos to Killerwife - I believe he is mainly responsible for a lot of those fixes). From this, I can only expect that the questing through the remainder of the Vanilla content will be held to the same high standards. Once I get to Outland, I know what to expect: great questing in Hellfire, Zangamarsh, Terrokar and Nagrand ... those zones were excellent back then with only a few areas to improve upon. As for Shadowmoon &amp; Netherstorm, they were doable for the most part, but needed a lot of work. I cannot comment on how those have progressed since. Class issues: Yes, there are still class mechanics that are not functioning properly. However, from reading many posts from the development team, they are being addressed. This may not be apparent to the player since we aren't seeing them rolled out one by one as they are fixed. No, the team has a different approach to this: rebuilding the entire system from the ground up. I believe it is Laizerox who is primarily responsible for this and judging from the other work we have seen from him, we can only expect the new system to be very good. I look forward to seeing this when it is finally rolled out. Instances: So far since my return, I have continued to have great experiences in various dungeons (RFC, RFK &amp; SFK so far). Prior to my departure, there were quite a few issues with the Outland dungeons, but comments from others have shown those to be mostly cleared up with ongoing work on Blood Furnace. (I believe X-Saviour is working on that to provide a great experience for all of us once we reach that point ... don't worry, you have some time). Community: Wow. That's all that needs to be said overall. On Stonetalon, the new PvE server, the lack of toxic comments in world is staggering. I always wondered if a PvE crowd would be more enjoyable to run around with and so far they have been. Development speed: Yes, we all have heard many terms used to describe VoA's development speed: Slow as f___, glacial, horrendous. There, it's been said again. However, people really need to look at the history and team and current situation - they are different. In the past, VoA had spent much of its time with a couple dozen players online and a small dev team who were enjoying both developing and life. Well, life is being overtaken and they are now going full speed ahead. All of them. We have seen so much evidence of the progress over the last 5 months that can only lead us to really look forward to their accomplishments over the next 3 or 4 months. The volume of fixes that have been implemented recently really show determination. Gruul's was just released and I believe I can expect Mag to be out before I am even geared and ready. Stability / Security: Seriously, the servers are extremely stable. The launch for Stonetalon was a touch rocky for the first 1.5 hours as everyone was hammering to get in, but they were able to get things under control and soon we were ingame having fun. Since the release, we had seen a few episodes where the server had crashed and we had our share of 30 second rollbacks, but that leads us to one of the larger issues as to why that was happening - security. They were tweaking the Warden system to prevent more people from being able to cheat. The brief pain we felt from this can only lead to much greater returns for us players. To the VoA staff: Thanks. tl;dr Vengeance of Azeroth has reached a maturity that you really need to experience for yourself - not second hand. Even if you've played there long ago and left, hop ingame again, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
4203	But we're an open minded community that wants to improve the game and is willing to hear all suggestions!	OMG people are so mean here. lol
4204	forgot the	Because the human eye can only see 24 FPS. Riot is being generous and throwing in an extra 6 fps too. 8)
4205	adds up, instead of getting better he eats wings	Are you eating with koosta, lol
4206	But, how can an actor act with no lines?	This is one of those instances where I feel like it's appropriate to say that you are just objectively wrong in saying he isn't good. That's asinine. And your criticism is his lack of lines? I don't even know where to start.
4207	Well haven't you heard of the massive pile of gold coins stashed away in the Vatican Bank?	That is true He made it sound like that is the only reason you become a priest and it's like a secret society which is just crazy
4208	They were *Polish* camps, remember	Adolf Hitler. No, seriously. The stereotype says Poles killed all those Jews during WW2.
4209	You don't have kids, you wouldn't understand	Telling people to control their goddamn kids. If your kid is acting like an asshole in public, I should be able to tell you it's unacceptable. But no, I'm a tyrant because I told you it's probably not good that your kid is climbing the shelves in the supermarket.
4210	Because you can't have more then one team you are a fan of.	Flair checks out
4211	I don't see why you wouldn't give them your personal information.	Pretty sad that the people being the biggest dicks are fellow officers.
4212	Yay go you!	When I come to Orlando, I am not going to this guys vape shop.
4213	I can't recall a situation like this in Euro 2004, I mean, obviously there's some fights and all (that happens in every derby game around the world) but not like what's happening in France.	Stuff like this have happened in pretty much every Euro I can remember. So no it has not ruined the competition for me
4214	It's not like cats jump	I couldn't care less about who's guilty. Explain to me why the tiger's containment had no roof.
4215	I only want a Chad who will pump and dump, thank you very much!	I love it how these people think that the dudes that fuck chicks often don't like cuddles and chilling as well. They legit have no idea what casual relationships entail. It's not like people just meet up have sex and leave all the time. Lots of chilling is also involved it's just more casual with no serious commitments. And the fact that they think girls are these mystical gatekeepers that can have sex whoever they want is just hilarious. Lots of women can't get the guys that they want all the time. Sure they could get laid easily but only if they lower their own standards etc. It's mind boggling how out of touch with reality these guys are. Thinking that it's everyone else's fault that they have no friends at all causes them to never improve themselves, feeding their own convictions constantly.
4216	Lol, yeah because that's what everyone focuses on when they see a doctor.	Drs also have massive debts.
4217	I love people who just **have** to explain the joke.	That's the joke.
4218	wow these online polls have absolutely no sample bias	CNN Live Vote, Who is more presidential Trump or Hilary
4219	Oh absolutely.	I live at a stop sign, and that last group of people also believe they are John Force, and need to test their broken car's acceleration at every stop. The wail of rusted out exhaust at full throttle really helps someone relax on a lazy sunday afternoon.
4220	Awesome job, I can't wait to bring your fifa career suggestions to my future save !	Players we should sell?
4221	Yeah, I'm sure the people who sided with the Nazis have a rock-solid moral compass	You cannot blame them.
4222	That's not annoying at all.	Typical Tim Kennedy tweet
4223	Wow I can believe how descriptive you've been!	Issues with wireless internet connection while wired internet connection runs smoothly I have some problems while running on my internet without an ethernet cable. The router is right underneath my desk, so that should not be the issue. Anyone with a solution?
4224	But doesn't that make the radiation leak out ?	My microwave can be opened from both sides
4225	Because Clarence Thomas and Ben Carson are the good ones.	I think they hate Obama for being liberal. I'd be willing to bet precisely zero of those people hate Clarence Thomas or Ben Carson, and all of them hate Bill Clinton.
4226	Well, you're not anti-Israel at all	It's less about diversity and more about pragmatism. Occupations are taxing. We (the US) can pay for it but they still need boots on the ground to do the actual oppression.
4227	Probably about 15,000 of them?	But how many of those are PC gamers with high-end rigs, and have an urge for VR?
4228	Yeah, it's really racist when poor whites are called out for voting against their interests when they vote republican.	Bernie Bros are racist as fuck in this thread.
4229	They have to.	DONT CLIFF HANGER US DONT DO IT.
4230	No im pretty sure only one is different.	There is quick charge and fast charge. Both are different. Samsungs use the QUALCOMM quick charge standard. Only usb-c device use the fast charge standard.
4231	Thanks for mobile link, it really loads well on a desktop browser.	Found in the office at the Italian restaurant I work at.
4232	Now I don't need to run an ENB just to fix the shadows... which means more FPS :)	They fixed the shadows. They fixed the shadows!
4233	Nah definitely transfer it, it's worth 2 candies right now.	I hatched a 98% perfect iv snorlax with zen, and hyper beam, can anyone tell me if it's worth the stardust to power up, or does lick body slam make this mon obsolete?
4234	Robbie Fowler snorting a six yard line of coke.	What are the most cringeworthy moments in football? I'm not talking about embarrassing defeats, more like the Michael Jackson statue at Fulham and John Terry's Full Kit Wanker routine at the CL final.
4235	I would get those when I was young because Sacajawea would come and take my teeth I lost at night and leave those coins	I know this because of the $1 coin.
4236	You can be trans and have OCD too, btw.	How do i know if i'm trans or if i have OCD?
4237	He is, one snort at a time.	You should've destroyed that heroin.
4238	New 52.	What's your favorite chest symbol? Mine is either the Year One chest symbol or The Dark Knight Returns chest symbol.
4239	wut	You Got it! Congrats!
4240	Exactly and will be for at least another year	The U.K. is still very much a part of the eu...
4241	I don't know why but this whole season seems like teams aren't that good.	I'd learn more towards meta. Playing champs (and an overall style) that favors your strengths will lead to better team synergy. That said, as the meta shifts as the season progresses, the team will have more synergy so even if the meta slightly falls out of their favor, they should still do well. Think TSM is the best team in NA but like G2 in EU, not sure how good the rest of their region is so thats always a factor in how strong a team is. Even in KR, I'm not sold on Jin Air, Rox, Samsung so its hard to gauge how strong KR is as a whole. Of course, none of this really matters since it seemingly always ends up being can you beat SKT in a Bo5
4242	Maybe we wil get gradually more and more insanity messages to pave the way for Atlas?	Don't you get the "hear something in the distance" message if you put multiple maps in the map device? Could insanity just be that message or putting multiple maps in the device? Maybe the "multiple sources now stack" in the patch notes means more than 2 maps where before it was the same "effect" for 2 or more maps?
4243	This just makes me think Sabonis was GOAT	7 AMAZING NIKOLA JOKIC FACTS
4244	No, that's the russian president Vladimir Putin, but i understand your confusion.	Is that a dick?
4245	Take it to the cops you knob.	FOUND: Gold/bracelet in Lakeview area
4246	I won't.	Then I suggest you don't look at the City data entry clerk wages.
4247	No jobs and frankly not very affordable.	You ever think about Vancouver Island? Maybe Victoria? I've lived in Ontario all my life and VI looks like an Amazing place to live. House is still affordable too, but jobs seems to hard to find. If I could find a decent job on the Island I'd be there in a heartbeat. Southern Ontario does have more job options but man rent/housing/ high cost of living really sets you back. I'd rather make less money, have a smaller affordable house and be surrounded by Ocean with no Snow.
4248	Oh don't worry, it's been quite a while now that it's pretty clear Erdogan is leaning more toward a resurrection of the Ottoman empire rather than a intergration to the EU.	You guys really need to understand this: Erdogan doesn't care about joining EU. Turkey were already a candidate when Erdogan elected in 2002 and since then he used it for his own agenda. He didn't actually try or expect to get in to EU. Fuck, even Akp's EU Affairs Minister said "We wouldn't even care if they don't make us a member" in 2014. This stuff keeps going because of politics of EU and Erdogan, nothing more. Everyone have problems in Turkey right now and joining EU is not top among them. I don't even remember when we had a chat about joining Eu with my friends last time. Since we know, with Erdogan it is simply impossible. Without Erdogan there is a really little chance not even worth to mention in our opinion.
4249	Unfortunately only you can see nicknames.	So after work today I stopped to get my car washed before heading home. While I was going through the line I kept seeing a pokegym just down the street being fought over, in the short time I was there it went back and forth between red and blue at least 5 times. I keep a Magickarp named Karpe Diem for just such occasions and stopped by once I was out of the wash, tore down the three levels Mystic had managed to get up, and left Karpe behind for the glory of Team Instinct! Needless to say he was back in my inventory before I'd even made it back to the stoplight... One day I'll finally get Karpe evolved but he's still keeping that name.
4250	He could still dunk, height doesn't disappear	He claimed in modern day game he'd average 10. After all he's in his 70s
4251	Then I was wrong and Austria should be part of the failed countries.	I think Austria has one region classed as a transition region.
4252	I doubt they would have written a whole episode about a power of Steven's just to write it off as non-cannon	We don't exactly know that at this point, and Too many Birthdays was an early episode, so we don't know what all is still canon from that episode, because they have changed how things work from the early episodes.
4253	To me it's been the reverse for centuries.	Some would say it's the reverse.
4254	Well duh, why should the government do something when private companies can do it for better profit, opps i mean better.	Come work traffic for a week you'd understand why we would want a 32hr week. Would never happen. It's completely unfeasible and irresponsible to do, especially now since we're cleaning up the mess that began with him firing the PATCO guys. Understaffed and overworked because the government failed to hire at an adequate rate to replace the controllers that are retiring. Fucking slap in the face to all of us to name an airport after him.
4255	Am 22, can confirm that I don't give a shit.	Thank you for your made up demographics. All the people I know who are most passionate in their hatred for this man are over 40. 16-25 year olds wouldn't watch the show (they are most likely on youtube etc) and are notorious in their apathy.
4256	No because then the Terrorists wont be caught anymore...	How can we honestly get rid of the TSA? They've had nothing but continual misconduct since their inception, have ruined travel, and I'm really surprised they haven't killed anyone yet.
4257	God DAMN, I love Gates so much!	Gates ft. Thrice and La Dispute - Not My Blood (Live)
4258	I know... I was asking where it went	Turbo everyone starts out at max req level.
4259	It will be Larsson if is Hall	I can't imagine a single trade that would justify trading hall to new Jersey. Why trade a top five left winger in the nhl for spare parts.
4260	so why not a slightly better 2-drop like flame juggler?	No, I mean Mad scientist. Even such a weak minion is enough to let him curve out more. Crackle has overload, so not playable on 2 unless he wants to miss his 3-drop.
4261	Yeah but there is also a bit of a difference between a T2 and a T5.. But even then I wouldn't sell just for a port slot.. Though I agree the Albany is probably the one that could get me closest to wanting to sell a premium (at least from pre-buff experience)	Free port slot if you really don't like the ship. I sold my Albany and don't regret it one bit.
4262	more challenge is more fun right?	PS4, just logged in, DPS down 53k.
4263	Lucky him, that shit is trash	You missed the era of 4loko
4264	Don't forget the ignorant Republitards would see the error of their ways and vote in an entire democratic ticket so that Bernie would have total and supreme power!	Not only that, I was under the impression that an unmarked black SUV would roll up on Hillary, throw a knapsack over her head and haul her off to Guantanamo. Which would lead to Bernie Sanders riding into the DNC on the back of a unicorn farting rainbows of free college and single-payer healthcare.
4265	Popular sure but flash altogether doesn't predate google.	Flash games were around before Google was popular.
4266	hope a firework hits you	bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
4267	Reading through all these posts is making for a very confusing internal soundtrack..	What song can you put in my head with a few words?
4268	Get xmod	But I want the notifications that are telling me about my chests ready to open
4269	Not quite.	Probably predates the US, a lot of things do.
4270	I had no side effects from Clomid or Femara, and only got a bit more emotional on stims.	I'm beginning to wonder if I'm in the minority, here. The only thing that happened to me on Clomid was headaches, and a hot flash around 11 pm that maybe lasted 20 minutes. I've had no symptoms from Follistim or my trigger shot (Ovidrel).

4272	Do you think Griff calls this trade "The D"?	Dave McMenamin on Twitter: "The Cavs will acquire Dunleavy with the traded player exception created by the Dellavedova swap with Milwaukee, sources tell ESPN"
4273	Yea the shooters don't deserve any blame..	The unabashedly, hyperactive, race baiting media and police unions. Shits gotta stop.
4274	To play with friends on console, and for ppl like me who are just more comfortable with a controller.	But then what's the point? Who would choose controller on PC for a RTS?
4275	Okada vs CM Punk, Tanahashi vs Seth Rollins, and Ibushi vs Randy Orton	Reddit, What are some fantasy matches that are not usually brought up that you believe would be amazing? In my opinion, i would love to see a Shinsuke Nakamura vs bobby fish, I believe that those two could put on an amazing, fast paced match. another dream matchup that i believe has flown under the radar is rob van dam vs zack sabre jr. that would just be fully of flippy shit, on the mat and in the air. i'd honestly like to see if zack would be able to counter RVD's rolling thunder into some crazy armbar of the sort. What matches would YOU like to see? comment below.
4276	I heard he really likes comic books so try not to ask him about those or you will never hear the end of it.	Dallas Fan Expo - Breakfast with Stan Lee advice? Good morning.everyone! Hope everyone is having a great weekend so far. I had a question that I am trying to get people's input on based on their past experiences. Its a tad off topic but it does revolve around Stan Lee. On June 5, Dallas Fan Expo is having a Breakfast with Stan Lee where you get to meet him, an autograph, a photo with your phone, and get to hear his stories and such. The pricr tag is a bit expensive at $300, hence why I am trying to get informed and educated on it before I ever commit. This is where yall come in. Has anyone been to one of these before? Can you tell about your experience? Is it worth it? I tried to get the con to tell me about the format but so far no response which has made me suspicious. In addition, I found one from Fan Expo Canada where it was a glorified panel, ala you ate while he answered questions and was signing stuff at the same time for 20 before cell phone pics, which doesnt seem worth $300 to me. Hence why im asking! Thank you all I appreciate the help!

4282	But couldn't they just have blown off his arms &amp; legs?	He had already killed five and wounded several others. He stated he was going out shooting, the cops saw a way to end it without putting any more police lives on the line, I'm ok with it.
4283	inb4 all the "character assassination" comments that will inevitably steam in from the SJWs on this, conveniently ignoring the poor 4 year-old girl that is being exposed to all of this at such a young age.	Mom livestreaming herself smoking a blunt and hotboxing a car with her 4 year-old daughter in the backseat. 3 Days later she livestreamed her boyfriend right after he was killed.
4284	Is sharing state secrets freedom of speech?	So what? That means nothing. I'm not saying their countries and culture respect freedom of speech, which they don't. As long as they don't harm anybody they can say anything they want, even if that hurts people's sensibilities, it is their right. That's the essence of freedom of speech; being able to say anything (even if it's bullshit) as long as it isn't a direct attack against any particular, in which case the affected individual can sue you.
4285	He has been.	jesus christ it feels like he's been playing a decade
4286	I suspect the few people who know facts that do not align with the official story, the one that Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with 9-11, that their credit cards were used by the flight schools without their knowledge; are all showing cognitive impairment (if they are still alive)	World Trade Centre responders with PTSD show 'staggering' signs of cognitive impairment: research
4287	Calling them "hackers" is like calling someone a doctor because they cut off a limb.	Hackers do the weirdest things for their nerd boners
4288	Good ole Rudy	Giuliani: Blacks must say "what they're doing among themselves about the crime problem"
4289	Yeah but you're english	I haven't lost to Ronaldo once and i already am.
4290	You get out of here with your smart ideas!	Run two double header weekends and have indycar Saturday for the first weekend, Sunday for the second.
4291	Sure, PA is my favorite, second is Leona 4Head	Honest question, don't get triggered: Are some of you guys seriously getting off on Dota heroes?
4292	Thank you!	Dr Keddy grant at the Winnipeg clinic! She's a fantastic divot that both myself and my brother have seen.
4293	What was that definition you provided then?	I never know what each comrade believes and I don't think they do either.
4294	You can find most "in" things after about 20 mins on Twitter looking at some of those parody accounts the things that are usually posted on there are the memes and such that are "in"	High Schoolers of Reddit: What are some things that are "in" right now?
4295	Wingspan is equal to my height.	What's your wingspan? Is short or longer than your height?
4296	What is this loan thing that you speak of?	I maybe wrong, but I once heard that loans were available for this kind of thing. And scholarships/grants. Maybe she should be made aware of this (if true).
4297	I bet it will maintain a loyal fanbase for a while.	While the concept is great, I think once people start playing and get over the hype that the game will end up very repetitive and boring..
4298	How did you begin collecting?	I collect artesian soap bars. I've got usually around 15 at any given time.
4299	forgot the	PC master race
4300	Boots, Urchin, Wrath, Mantle, Void, Bane.	What's a good bellona build? It's been a time since last time i play smite and i see bellona has been nerfed and i feel like she need something, that's why i'm asking for a good build for her, sorry if my english is not the best xD
4301	Thank you for the response.	I apologize a head of time for a short-ish response due to being at work, but being dedicated to the sub I wanted to reply. --- Basically boils down to the fact that if heat comes to reddit admins due to something our community is doing, allowing, provoking, or encouraging, then the admins could shut down our subreddit. We want the subreddit to live and thrive, so we don't want that to happen, so we are being a little extra cautious. In addition, we don't have the support to monitor every game install file shared, and many people have _very_ bad intentions. We would like to keep this community safe and not allow some bad malware file to get upvoted on the principle that they are 'helping' the community by providing something without checking if it's safe or not before they upvote it, thus adding in their support, and promoting the comment or post to the top, for even more people to get hurt. Fuck, we see a lot of spam, malware, on this sub just due to sheer volume.
4302	What video?	No matter how many times content like this is posted I click and sit in awe for a few seconds. Just like that carl sagan video...must watch every time.
4303	TIL being upset because you just witnessed terrorists fly into buildings and kill thousands of people in your home country where those kind of things aren't supposed to happen is cowardly	Ignorant of what? Do you seriously think I don't know why we moved? Of course I do. (And it wasn't "with my parents," I only grew up with a mother). US is a much better nation to live in than the one I grew up in, there is no question about that. I am far more aware than you are, as you might imagine, having actually lived in both. But do you really think that this fact excuses cowardice? Excuses giving up freedom for an illusion of safety? Excuses, first and foremost, wars of aggression? And do you think that it would be unethical for me, an American citizen that has done A LOT for this country, to call out the population on eagerly giving up freedoms for this safety, because of fear, due to never having seen anything dangerous in their lives?.. I believe the answer to all of these questions is false. And this doesn't make me ignorant of anything, or an asshole. I am just as much of an American as someone born here, and am just as much in a position to criticize this nation, even if it comes from an unusual background.
4304	You must be from a real shitty neighborhood	Have been neighbors with Jamal Crawford (when he played for CHI) and Dickey Simpkins. Also used to be family friends with Stacey King (I grew up with his kids) and great family friends with B.J. Armstrong, after he retired. Jamal may be the nicest dude I've ever met. He was such a great guy.
4305	Super Hydroxycut is *perfect* for this, at least according to the commercials.	How to tone up for a bikini fast?
4306	Who thought criminals, drug dealers, and rapists could be such industrious builders?	Rumor had it Mexican immigrants from Home Depot's parking lot financed and erected the wall.
4307	I watch Jericho's YouTube, so there's that.	I like how people here seem to think that streamers are well known outside of their gaming community
4308	Not sure how I feel about this one tbh	New Treasure Hunter Promo - Wonderbar
4309	I keep mine in the bathroom why is it in your bedroom?	Good idea, that's where I keep the lotion!
4310	Nothing makes you more of a man than believing in the superiority of your race!	Our society is so pussified at this point that I'm pretty sure just stating these facts makes you racist.
4311	If the black dude had dressed less attractive to bullets, this wouldn't have happened.	It's fine. I read the article. The cop was trying to kill the autistic white guy but the bullet magically found its way into the black dude. Crazy huh?
4312	Aahhh, I completely missed that	I know about the phrase coup de grace, but considering the mcdonald's-heavy nature of his comment I assumed he was deliberately substituting "gras," the french word for fat.
4313	ESO	Which MMORPG'S have you enjoyed from lv1 to max? In todays day and age, it feels like a lot of mmorpgs are pretty dull, either they have an endgame which consists of almost nothing, or they have months of boring repetitive grind to get to "endgame content" (aka fun stuff) Which mmorpg has brought you the most enjoyment all the way through?
4314	I think you forgot	Fuck kurzesagt, fuck vsauce, fuck vox. I'm watching jamich in 2016 lol
4315	lol yes but it works with the OP shock turret because, you know, shock turrets are so easy to kill you should be able to heal them!	All healing is also applied to skill objects Doesnt work to the shield sadly when I tested it :/
4316	I know of VIAB and BX, who am I missing?	More vendors in the Carolinas? I'm gonna end up going broke buying local.
4317	Shumpert getting a flagrant for that ball tap, right?	Lol that's not the hand he's holding its his balls
4318	So by that logic, Government should outright ban people going to Red-light districts because they are hotbed for illegal activity?	Bombay HC blocks 110 filesharing websites completely after changed mind about SpicyIP blog arguments
4319	That's not a nice name, they're called the 2016 Oakland A's fyi	Raw sewage would leak onto the field
4320	They're cool because they aren't Muslim	What about non-muslims from similarly poor war torn countries?
4321	90.5 WQED is the only station I listen to, there than that its my plugged in cell phone with podcasts and mp3's	Why is radio so bad here? Seems like that every other city I visit, there are so many more radio stations
4322	And what other historical trends will we slip into; women wearing gigantic skirts and corsets laced so tight they're a health hazard, building gigantic stone tombs for world leaders, polytheism, arranged marriages and designated matchmakers like in Fiddler On The Roof?	Modern historical civilization is 2016 years old we have almost 4k before that of recorded history and it grows more and more. Easily 10k years of history. Almost all of it with kings at the top a small nobility and a large amount of yes man. Than slaves/labor for every one else. Even if you start at the renaissance its a fraction of time historically. And even than we had slaves. Im a history major and we can and probably will eventually slip back into kings on the top slaves everywhere else.
4323	Now Niantic can't even get their pokemon right...	pokemon changed after caught Can't believe my eyes.. I just caught an Oddish, and then it showed up as a Bellsprout in my bag.. Has this happened to anyone else?
4324	Real men use i7's.	Celeron D Chess Board. Work in progress for a mates birthday.
4325	You won't tell me what to do *upvoted*	Please Don't Upvote, but How will a i5-3350P with a GTX 970 work on JC3? I know that JC3 is poorly optimized, but would I be able to get 60 FPS on high or Ultra?
4326	LEAK THOSE STRATS	They obviously took it down because the strats were leaked. I opened it a few minutes ago and I'm still listening to it atm.
4327	If it makes you feel any ~~better~~ worse, that's the first skin I got :b Pray to the RNG gods?	I just spent over 130 dollars trying to get get Genji's Nihon skin... Help.
4328	Isn't he the guy from salad dressing?	That would be a mister Paul Newman thankyouverymuch
4329	He's asking specifically for stuff to bring home to Denmark and guns and (foldable) knives are banned in Denmark..	OP, don't let small details like this get in your way.
4330	No, obviously only dumb southerners like guns.	Being pro second amendment doesn't exclude you from higher-level jobs, to say otherwise would be perpetuating a gross stereotype. People from all walks of life shoot and carry, that's kind of the point
4331	TIL CPUs can take pictures.	The 820 isn't a bad chip. Maybe not the best in the world but certainly not bad. And it does take very good low light pics when implemented properly.
4332	I'm seeing it on this post as well	Could not decode bitmap, seeing this a lot.
4333	Thank god you wore vertical stripes or else this photo would've looked really bad	My mate has a dark sense of humor, please roast his sorry ass.
4334	"Hyah."	"C'mon, Roach"
4335	it's even easier than you could imagine [don't]	What's the best way to go about becoming your friend?
4336	What we should do is enact an IQ test for voters so anyone who disagrees with me is disenfranchised, eh old boy?	People shouldn't be allowed to vote until the age of 35. That's when the brain leaves childhood.
4337	-34 karma AND Reddit gold... color me surprised	What. The. Fuck. (r/childfree gets brought up in AskReddit again)
4338	That the world is flat	What's a fact people refuse to accept?
4339	Yup	only 29 have 2??
4340	I meaaaaannnn.... he kinda cute tho tbh	Acting like a bitch only got Tyler Perry famous
4341	You can't improve upon perfection.	You couldn't even be bothered to write an actual argument and instead just copy-pasted another answer, could you?
4342	Prince of Egypt is still the best telling of that story, with the possible exception of DeMille's Ten Commandments.	God damn straight.
4343	You dropped this:	Relax shes innocent. She only deleted classified emails because the FBI didnt have clearance to read them. Plus Russia is hacking the DNC so they were probably never interested in Hillary's aol email. Lets take her word for it because shes got nothing to gain by lying.
4344	Yeah but unless you live on the same side of the international dateline, they'll never happen at the same time.	TIL my birthday shares the same day as Norways national day
4345	No he should just throw it away.	Smoke it up!
4346	Julio Lugo?	God it's been so so so so long since I've loved a SS so much!
4347	Too hard to turn the camera around for a better pic?	Mackinac Bridge!
4348	Great that means the bleaching starts tomorrow.	Deeper 6,000 sq km reef discovered hidden behind Great Barrier Reef
4349	Yeah it makes it too... survivally	well, then i just have to carry a bota bag as well mechanics like this make sense realistically, but it would just bloat the game
4350	But I thought he had tiny hands...	Not really sure, I think the Donald has a large hand in the uprising of the sub tho ^^did ^^u ^^see ^^wat ^^I ^^did ^^thar?
4351	Can't they also be destroyed?	2 t1 at minimum give t2.
4352	So lets take away rights from all of them, just to be safe.	Some of them are, *very* dangerous.
4353	But you never would have known to sell high unless they told you!	Bad Guy ESPN: How am I supposed to sell high on Fernando Rodney when his player note is to sell high on him?
4354	ya finally quinn has the movespeed to roam effectively.	dam never thought about that....sol having the cloud dragon buff and running down lane, or quin roaming
4355	because there are so many and you buy them throughout the whole match.	Can starter items be on the same tree like relics and consumable?
4356	Lol, i forgot the	It's not that bad. Most of the attention is on CS and Halo since they're the ones struggling
4357	Romney was such a flip flopper.... ....that's why I support Trump instead	Floppy Donnie back at it again
4358	Wow, could I get some of that shill money?	Isn't it obvious?
4359	Of course of course, completely different parties with different philosophies	Literally what you just said has nothing to do with my previous post... Primera Justicia and Voluntad Popular did not even existed before and you keep blaming them for the action of AD and Copei.
4360	Blizz loves wizards and hates monks, so no nerf for wizards.	Will Blizzard nerf the hell out of Firebird instead of fixing it like they did to Static Charge?
4361	eh as long as your not black or Latino you should be good.	Too bad you also have the most infamously corrupt police in the country.
4362	Lol red is for suckers, I only bet odd numbers.	I would suggest him to bet more on red. Easy way to make money.
4363	I tell ya what, these kids today..	Man, 42, to face charges (failing to stop, and unrelated charges) over Porirua crash that killed 21-year-old woman
4364	2/10, should've used "cl off" :(	The Descent - Vault 113 - Fallout 4 Mod Teaser
4365	Lotus Notes is the most powerful mail client available.	There's a cheaper option for O365 in India? I think the latency to on-shore datacenters will be bad enough compared to onprem. Of course, we're coming from Lotus Notes so *anything* is better if you have any clue at all :)
4366	Oujay is the only Durandal candidate	He's not using Durandal? Obviously an imposter.
4367	Diglett dig Diglett dig Trio Trio	String of underground dynamite
4368	Yeah definitely not a good idea to buy two reputable rifles for cheap	Mauser and 10/22 You're basically a clone of the average user on here

4370	"old"	Sorry, old r/canada joke. Probably not funny anymore.
4371	This would never happen in California.	That avocado sure is taking a while to oxidize.
4372	No on reddit there is not logic it's just white people hating themselves	The Italian ad is for clothing dye. It's not about cleanliness it is about style. The "before" in the Italian ad had a hairy body, receding hairline, long white socks, and oversized underwear. The"after" looked like a shaved extra from magic mike. The Chinese ad is straight up dirty to clean.
4373	Oh amazing guitarist DrLawyerson please teach me tapping as you are the only one with the knowledge of something as special as that	I don't get why you're rubbed raw about that. Like.. Do you play? Even if you don't, someone could teach you to tap in about 5 minutes
4374	You forgot the	Who believes these guys? They are wrong. Climate change is a man made lie
4375	I heard they are releasing it when we beat Faze on LAND.	Any word on when Brisk Mate will Release everywhere? I was just wondering if anyone had an idea when it would be released in more states in the US. I live in a State where it isnt releases but i have had ma Family member send me some from Denver and it is amazing and want it in my state.
4376	and the government represents the people	Yea then it is rigged
4377	Turn up the hi-hats in the drummer's headphone feed until he hits softer.	Recording in a small room, whats the best way to dull hi-hats? Pre recording or in post?

4379	Caucuses can't be undemocratic, they mostly helped Bernie	Let me know when she launches a petition about ending caucuses.
4380	The civil rights took like 2 years to accomplish	If you're actually sincere: you know things happen in stages right? Your attitude is like saying "that first round of chemo didn't kill the cancer and made you lose your hair, so let's just stop right now, since obviously the second and third rounds won't work."
4381	We all believe that everything posted here is $100% true and mod verified.	Is the thathappend subreddit like ironic or do people really think that happened?
4382	Who is this "EU"?	EU isn't important enough right
4383	And you and I would deserve to pay for it because we elected the piece of shit official who hired the piece of shit cop.	The city will just raise its taxes to pay for officer misconduct. It is you and I who end up paying when the cops get caught.
4384	She just likes Evolution OKAAY?	Heather is so thirsty to be on Bravo....
4385	Ewwww old people aren't people why were they allowed to vote?	Brexit: London, Scotland, N. Ireland, and younger generations voted to remain. Almost everyone else voted to leave.
4386	Build a PC.	Pulled a PS4 off of a shelf while in bed almost sleeping, I heard it near enough smash but was to tired to care. On a plus note the disc inside was completely fine.
4387	Democracy works!	They seized the crimea parliament with special op teams in the night and raised the russian flag in the morning. There was nothing left to chance. Maybe it would have happened anyway likely but Russia rigged the thing.
4388	Because hots contracts are historically known to be strictly upheld and fair to players	If it's not a punishment or an example, then why not release him and be the bigger person? Because that's the options. He's either being punished and made an example out of, or he's being released to move on. Can't have both.
4389	I've been capturing every horrible, head scratching lag situation for a killer compilation video	Destiny server hampsters dying? Is anyone else having issues with the game constantly poping up the message Error: Contacting Destiny Servers. ?
4390	Michelle Trachtenburg and David Attenborough	If you could have a threesome with any two people in the world, with the stipulation that their names had to rhyme, who would you choose?
4391	Right, 70-80 dollars is still pretty expensive for a broken game if you ask me.	Games didn't cost 90 when MCC came out. And it has been super cheap for a year plus.
4392	Didn't you hear the AG's response?	But will it be handled just like every other case?
4393	Down vote literally everything you don't agree with	What is an unwritten rule of Reddit?
4394	You forgot this:	good and make sure you hunt down every fucking north korean terrorists
4395	I'm a bitch and proud of it so it's acceptable.	When a woman calls herself "strong woman" nowadays, she usually just means obnoxious, opinionated and entitled.
4396	Must be part of the super EE.	One thing noticed about Zis intro Willard Wyler has a purple sacrifice circle in the projector room. Could it be a possible reference to revelations and could it point to ZiS connecting to Treyarch's story in some way?
4397	I'm sure the kind of friends worth making are just like him.	All seven of my randoms quit on BTB(Halo 5). Got this from one of their teammates...because I didn't quit.
4398	Where's my damn copy?	If I get 100 upvotes, I'll buy everyone who upvotes a copy of Sun and Moon I'm rich and bored. Make me proud Reddit! Leave a comment below after upvoting so I know to message you to send a copy.
4399	Just warming up for a bite...	Lick, lick, lick, lick. . . Bite!
4400	The only maps I really saw snipers in were like Derail and Wasteland, maps like Storm, Terminal, scrapyard and Rust made no sense and were just to small for snipers to stay alive or find a good nest.	The intervention was a one shot kill from the stomach and above if you remember correctly, and it took months before people started actually using stingers
4401	It's always been like this	Amazon Return Shipping Charges - Policy Change? I recently purchased a backpack off Amazon, and didn't like how it looked when it arrived. I selected "No longer needed" for the return shipping reason, and noticed that amazon charged me $10 for the return shipping (on a $40 backpack). I contacted their customer care, and they offered to refund it, but they said since I chose "no longer needed" is why I was charged return shipping. Is this a recent Amazon policy change? I feel that I order a lot of items off amazon, and some of them I want to check out/return because I didnt like them. I can't recall ever being charged return shipping. Has anyone else experienced this?
4402	This is the better solution and I recommend it every freaking time.	Ammo pickups should restore percentage of ammo each as well, not raw number of ammo.
4403	Space Banditos?	Space Pirates?
4404	###**YOU CAN'T LOCK UP THE SUCTION**	Wut m8?
4405	That slushie at the end was savage	Grant is a smooth criminal
4406	The sub has been ~~revived~~ reposted!	The sub has been revived!
4407	I don't respect judgemental cocksuckers either.	Of course I watched it. I watched one episode and turned it the Fuck off because it's was so annoying. I don't respect adults that are obsessed with this stupid show. Sure young kids I get....but adults ? How......HOW ?! the show has zero substance with a stupid plot and like I mentioned, characters who do nothing for most of the show except annoyingly screech their own names over and over. Oh yeah and people are trespassing on other people's property. I don't care if this is a game that has positive effects people need to stop trespassing. And also pay attention to your damn surroundings especially after a 15 yr old got hit by a car playing this stupid game
4408	TPP obviously, she totally won't flip on that again.	Hillary IS Obama without the oratory skill. What policies is Obama for that Hillary is against, or vice-versa?
4409	i have been experiencing a similar issue when i tried to login on a different phone (both android though), it just made a new account hopefully i can get back to the first phone and see if its still logged in	Trainers, some iOS users may be experiencing an account login issue
4410	yeah but we saved like 1 million over 2 players... that's the type of hahd bahghan that you get with those gritty guys	There goes the idea of young core... Lets stack up with 30 something year old's.
4411	Interesting, is it very euphoric?	The best way to describe it for me is that everything turns sort of square, objective and mathematical. If you notice the way he moves his arms and hands around in perfect sync at 6:01+ and dangling forwards and backwards is extremely indicative of the ketamine effect. You feel like a robot, movement is mechanic. It's weird.
4412	Haha	Well, at least my username isn't a botched version of a god damn movie rating. Just sayin', pal.
4413	If Trump wins the USA will probably withdraw from the EU	The president of France says if Brexit won, so can Donald Trump
4414	Ooh yeah, that's a good one too	The pod racing scene in Star Wars episode 1
4415	Message the mods something that would prove it (work id for example) with the personal information blacked out.	Sorry for the noob question, but how do I do that? I didn't know I could verify that I worked for the church.
4416	A knee in the balls will tell the ladies who is who.	'Family' Group Says It's Now Sending Men Into Target's Women's Restrooms
4417	I don't know what this is about but it starts in two minutes, see you there guys.	At 9PM, BST, we're going to watch Your Grammar Sucks #100! Come join us! (That's in 52 minutes!)
4418	*Dude you're telling the noobs shut up*	Shh! I'm trying to keep new people out of the market!
4419	he also clearly speaks very broken Engrish and according to other comments he made, he's looking for something with a lil variety, "get fat too" or whatever is just him equating "get fat" to "eat a lot"	He said "cheapest menu I can get fat" i love mcmuffins and eat multiple ones on break like thats ur opinion
4420	Aight, thanks for the clarification	Must be the wrong guy. I don't do skins or whatever that is.
4421	Jokes on crossfit, miyao brothers don't have any joints left to be destroyed.	Miyao Brothers Training CrossFit?
4422	And a one German speaking queen, who was probably more important for Croatia than all of those kings	We also had german speaking Kings for almost 400 years and we were on Germanys side in WW1.
4423	Doe mij maar een saaie politicus met inhoud, in plaats van populistisch geschreeuw en modder gooien.	Ik vraag mij af of de toon van dit verkiezing seizoen een beetje wordt opgekrikt door de verkiezingen in de USA. Hoe dan ook geniet ik wel van een beetje stoere taal her en der van politici. Dat ben ik eigenlijk alleen van Wilders gewent.
4424	Y'know what I'm sayin'?	Wait, didn't eminem come on the weird al show, though? Guess it coulda been before the song came out. Just seems weird that he'd even be the kinda guy to get upset about that since he's constantly ripping into other celebrities in his own songs
4425	Oh thank God that makes it so much better.	Remember. Most Islamic terror attack victims are other Muslims.
4426	So say we all	Can confirm. Am moose
4427	We do have all this infrastructure collapsing around us we could use some steel around here.	Goldman Warns on Swelling Iron Ore Surplus as Miners Add Supply
4428	That's an exhibition of the kind of team spirit that makes the Olympics an inspiration to us all.	Rio police tell tourists they won't be able to protect them - The state's police officers vented their anger last week with a sign saying "Welcome to Hell" outside Rio airport. "Police and firefighters don't get paid, whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe," the sign said.
4429	Amen to that	I'm straight, and Alberta winters made me realize I needed a moisturizing routine.
4430	It's funny because no matter how good his album is, it won't make up for all the bullshit he put his fans through, so it will probably get rated poorly.	"Rolling Stone has confirmed that Endless is a different project from Boys Don't Cry, the singer's highly-anticipated follow-up to 2012's Channel Orange. Apple will release that album this weekend."
4431	Loved him in Zoolander	Donald Trump.
4432	Guild flags/glory buildings?	How does other people's copper hit for 50k in gw? My copper has bonus 1.5k def and 176% and only does like 42k.
4433	You act like they didn't make the killer robots first!	I think the super rich are making a calculation that they can get to the killer robot production before the riots and revolution start happening, and then they can just kill off those they deem 'undesirable.'
4434	Actually doing things as they should be done Constitutionally	Trump: I may ask Congress to formally declare war to fight terror
4435	Even though I am a guy, I would start wearing a burkini just to screw with the government...	French official threatens to sue social media users who share burkini photos
4436	I can't unsee that now, thanks	They're staring at me... make it stop make it stop MAKE IT STOP!
4437	sweet thanks for your response	It's never too late to take gravity readings. Check out the r/mead/wiki section on hydrometers. * With an estimated OG (by using the calculators in the sidebar) you can figure out what your ABV is. * successive gravity readings at this point will help you determine whether fermentation is still going, or if it's safe to bottle. * gravity readings will tell you how much sugar remains in your mead, which you can then use to determine if you want it sweeter, and once you find a sweetness you like, you can build recipes to fit that.
4438	Yeah I saw that I just didn't know how long after the 10th it would be	MSI already announced their lineup so i assume it won't be long after 10th which is release of founder's edition.
4439	Yeah this is an absolute haul for Cashner	Before the Capps/Guerro tweet, I was on the fence, but now I'm a big fan. Should be a great deal for both sides - Marlins trade away prospects who look nowhere near MLB ready, a pitcher who hasn't helped them at all this season, and a pitcher who is physically unable to help them this season. Meanwhile, Padres continue their quest for 2020 NL West domination.
4440	I could see them trading either Carrera or Pompey to replace car go and then maybe that Rios fella and another low level prospect	CarGo looking to get out of Colorado Any chance of us getting Carlos Gonzalez from the rockies as a possible replacement for Jose? He's a little younger and he's a lefty, seems like a good fit to me.
4441	His first "injury" is going to be theater and you know it.	This is really funny to me but instead of an injury id rather it be like a penalty miss or a red card or something less... malicious?
4442	...the dissenters get guilt tripped and bitched about because obviously anyone who says no is a selfish, cold-hearted asshole.	'Have to identify five volunteer caregivers in the office.' And if five don't put up their hand...
4443	Then I hereby present you with the award for shittiest troll that isn't even remotely funny.	I appreciate your effort, but I am not particularly serious with my posts on the matter. I just like trolling people who pretentiously attempt to be quintessentially English, usually revolving around tea.
4444	They're more of ROAKs, to say, no the only thing sacrificed is your time.	But you aren't sacrificing anything.

4451	What kind of phone is it and what app are you using?	I just hit 111,111 on my car odometer yesterday. I pulled over into a parking lot just to take a pic of it. I would post the pic here, but I took it on my new phone and I have no idea how to do anything on it.
4452	Don't forget " hahaha and they keep thinking billionaire ............... Is one of them."	We have serious problems here
4453	1337 Thanks OP!	Naninights Giveaway! I have a code for Naninights i don't need. Post a top level comment with a number between 0 and 11000 I will pick and PM the winner tomorrow at 6:30 PM EST. Good Luck!

4455	17 minutes until the download finishes, can hardly contain my excitement!	No Man's Sky is now released for the PC!
4456	It's when the original game was released.	What happens December?
4457	Of course people who went across the world will give a code that they only have 1 of to complete strangers.	Wow this was supposed to be a code share post like on other reddits for ppl that attend events and don't want there codes and want to give them to those for those that are less functional to get a code but apparently the mods here are (word censored) fine then whatever
4458	Why are you even trying to open the launcher?	Unable to Verify Version; PS4 Is anyone else having issues getting into the launcher on the PS4? I gather the servers are offline (for... some reason), but that's never stopped me from opening the launcher at least. Kind of concerned because of tomorrow's patch.
4459	If the Holocaust really happened I'd feel guilty CHECKMATE LIBTARDS	That hypocracy. Why is it that blacks or Muslims have to answer for an entire race/religion, but white people don't? I don't personally feel responsible for anything anyone else does.

4470	I mean I get that we need to clean up the sport, but fuck...	wow this went from being one of the best cards of the year to meh real fast - really really hope he uses the tainted supplement excuse and can fight again soon, I bet the new owners are distraught now they've lost another of their top sellers.
4471	Try some rice now	TIL That Touch ID works with a dogs paw
4472	there is no way they could get in legal trouble for that lol	Only difference is Jagex could get in huge legal trouble if they did that, not to mention PR backlash for being found out, so I'm inclined to believe they did not do something so reckless for something like this.
4473	Who needs spotify when we all have it on vinyl and cassette now?	"Jah won't pay the bills" is on spotify The yearly thought of "It's not summer without Sublime" came across my mind yesterday. So I was gonna listen to self titled and I saw a new release. "Jah won't pay the bills". I personally like the original with the random explosion, but it's cool they remastered the tracks.
4474	Because they're heroes who risk their lives every day for us!	Yah it's that damn medias fault for showing cops doing bad things. If they just showed them buying little girls ice cream then we'd have no problem! I don't understand how people are so unwilling to put any of the blame on the cops themselves for how they come across
4475	This response made my day.	In my headcanon, Wesley is a Time Lord.
4476	IIRC, the prohibition against this and some other things comes from the book Elements of Style, so they were guidelines for clearer writing, not grammatical rules.	TIL it is perfectly acceptable to start a senstence with a conjunction (and, but, for, nor, or, so, yet)
4477	And send dick pics	And what? AND WHAT?!?!?!
4478	No, *you're* stupid!	Jesus these comments are all fucking stupid.
4479	How the hell is that thing supposed to turn with fairings that extend down almost all the way to the ground?	BMW Titan Motorcycle Concept
4480	Does he need to?	Why don't you come out and say what you mean?
4481	Yeah but the 'old' gender neutral pronouns are sexist, restrictive, and part of the Patriarchy!	"They". We have a gender neutral pronoun already, it's "they". Don't force your silly neopronouns on babies.
4482	What an original name	Jane Sinner
4483	My PC *IS* my tv currently	What's the difference?
4484	Yeah if only they knew what was good for them...	Bernie stated as far back as 2012 that he didn't think minorities were necessary for building a democratic coalition for national elections. He showed that during his run this year, and his followers have acted the same way trying to discount Hillary's wins in *southern*(wink wink) primaries. So no, it's not that they believe that blacks were swayed by CNN. It's that they don't understand or care how important minorities are to building a coalition so they don't even think about them.
4485	Man, Lincecum really busted out his batting ability	Tim Lincecum @ Astros: 1.1IP, 8ER, 2BB, 3HR Brought to you by sadness
4486	Don't call me ape, you chimp!	A charging gorilla silverback or not will fuck up even the The Rock's johnson. Compared to other apes, humans are incredibly weaksauce for the size of our bodies. This is a big reason why the Cincinnati Zoo killed Harambe rather that wait till they could get tranqs. Harambe could have sneezed on that child and broke its teeny tiny back. Now a cheetah is easy pickings compared to hairy Tarzan. A cheetah is 'human'-sized and weak in close combat. You could definitely walk away from fighting a cheetah. You'll most likely be ripped to shreds but you'll be alive. If you fight a gorilla you will have your chest cavity crushed, your face bitten off, and your body beaten around. So... I pick the kitty.

4488	Well I'm near Chicago so I'd have to ship it and install myself, but intakes aren't that difficult to install on a GTI from what I've seen	I don't have one now, but I am local to that area and John does great work. It really sounds the best and pulls the best power. Best part is, it's $350 or whatever discount code applied, installed. So you can have him install it for $350 flat
4489	Uucmy for us most of them are nowhere near intelligent enough or would bury their heads in the sand to comprehend the information	Norway had to accept full freedom of travel, membership in Schengen and most EU regulations, without representation, in order to obtain that. They're basically worse in every way than full EU membership. The Brexit people would have heart attacks over ending up with the same arrangement as Norway once they'd learn what it involves.

4493	Good thing signs stop bad guys!	Interesting CCW Article in USA Today
4494	Don't feel bad, they're just a bunch of *con*artists.	The one time I was really embarrassed was when I was in an otaku convention and I had no money to spend on it. I felt like a failure as a fan. I really wanted to support my local artists too.
4495	With that pace, what do you expect?	True Martial World. I stopped reading around 500 but he's been stuck at the same cultivation rank for a long time (I forget but wasn't he on the second level after purple blood warrior or something?).

4498	So, like *seriously tempered* rage?	The box of leds I just bought said each bulb costs $3.12 to run a year. I don't turn them off.
4499	Get out of here with your nuance and understanding, you either gotta be a corporate shill or a communist to talk about these things	You need a balance. Having a monopoly (for either company or union) makes your position too powerful, and abuse of that power becomes extremely easy. (Lowering wages/cutting benefits on one side, making it impossible to fire crappy employees/making impossible demands on the other) The only problem is, the size a union needs to grow to become effective at dealing with employers being abusive of worker's, is close-ish to the size when they can just start making stupid demands.

4503	Time to open up a gun store!	Patrick Morrissey, the attorney general for West Virginia who is supposed to prosecute pharma companies for turning the state into a virtual pill mill - receives *huge* donations from pharmaceutical companies for his reelection campaign this year. The money affects politicians of all sizes, in virtually every state. Meanwhile, WV is an opioid-addicted hellhole with little hope in solving the issue.

4510	Because you're a fucking burger lmao.	Why is my aim still bad? I have been grinding every cod since black ops 2 (I know pros and stuff have been playing wayyyyy longer) and my aim still feels like trash. I know realistically its better than average but its still not as good as i want it to be. I recently started playing comp like during the middle of AW and I was just wondering why my aim is not as good? Have I not played/grinded enough? do I have bad aim habits or something? Any suggestions is helpful thank you
4511	I didn't buy my truck so I could make a small percentage more money selling it in 5 years, I bought the best value truck that I can actually use for those five years.	The resale value after 5 or six years would have been much better in the Tacoma. They're like Jeep Wranglers.
4512	He signed with us May 20, and his contract was technically done with Detroit at the end of June.	Can someone explain why we lose a 3rd for babs. I thought he was a free agent
4513	Well I mean paying it off "would be for nothing"!	I have no idea why he has credit card debt if he makes over $70k, even with student loan payments. Granted, $2.5k is not a lot, but why have it at all? The interest rate is so high.
4514	Don't worry, they will boot him for such a bad pun.	Heel have his tongue cut out for this one.
4515	Why on earth would they do that, when they have things like video games to distract them and comforts beyond imagination?	If only you guys would get this angry about your governments, or famine, or inequality.

4517	well for me driving under 5k in the city is comfortable, unfortunately the issue occurs for anything under 5k ish	The engine might be faltering to keep strength up to raise a gear at low RPMs. Just drive comfortably, the car doesn't eat much gas anyways, as long as you don't pedal it. My G37 gets me 24MPG when I drive comfortably and most people get 17-19 on it.
4518	Just buy the PSA you'll love it	PSA Lower? I'm in the process of getting all my parts together for an AR-15 build, and I'm still searching for a lower/lower parts. PSA always has outrageous deals on assembled lowers with a Magpul stock, and the deals seem almost too good to pass up. Are there any problems with PSA's lowers? And also, are there any higher quality brands that'll cost me about the a lower? I'll be using this rifle as a sort of do it all rifle, since it's my first AR. Range toy, home defense, and I guess SHTF if that happens within the next few months.

4523	No mate, you eat it by itself by the spoonful	Goddammit people, calling Vegemite a snack is like saying salt is a meal. It's basically a condiment.

4531	So Bran is the reason the Starks always know winter is coming?	Bran Stark, the Mad King and everything fits together with this theory From S6E3, Bran realizes that others can hear him during the visions from the past, but doesn't understand that they cannot fully understand him. He attempts to reason with King Aerys when shown a vision of him. The King only hears whispers, and is driven mad by it. Bran tries to fix this, however makes it worse. Mad King Aerys burns Bran's grandfather alive while Bran frantically tries to stop him. All he hears is whispers. Bran sets the events of the show in motion.

4535	I think some more death threats and assaults are in order, right?	They screw us over and expect us to take it smiling.
4536	It is a strong mech, but with 4+ 100t mechs in a pug match as it is now, there is simply more damage to be dealt in a round, so the average dmg should rise.	Kodiak 3 seems OP. First, I want to say I am not the best player. Playing to the meta, 500 damage is a great game for me, 1-2 KMDD. Before the Kodiak dropped. With an XL 375, 4 Ultra AC10s, 13 tons of ammo, and the base 10 heat sinks (considering going to 11 tons for 12 heat sinks), I'm routinely putting out 700+ damage games with 3+ KMDD. Almost every game. I don't know if my play style just naturally synergizes to this mech or what, but it seems monstrously strong at my play level.
4537	Nah man Bjerg just needs to firstpick Zed every game and they will win worlds.	You don't just play assassins because you feel like it...any midlaner would have to be an idiot to not be playing Ryze/Azir/Viktor and other niche control mages in the upcoming patch.

4539	yeah he sure showed that school not that he smokes weed everyday.	My roommate at college/friend from high school was forced into a Christian academy for grades K-8. He and I blaze almost every day now and talk about how much he hated that shit.
4540	Ha, it's funny because Christian fanatics, I get it!	No, No, No! The Earth is only 6000 years old. Please stop with your attempts to rewrite history. GW Bush knew the truth. Please, with the power of Christ, you will understand.

4547	LeafPad is the best text editor.	My moment was different from the other people here. In my first year of college, I had a programming class. It was during that time that I started using Vim for most of my text editing needs, so I used Vim during that class as well. One day I was having trouble with something and so I took my laptop over to my professor so I could ask for help. He looked at the screen with a grim face and just said "oh... you use Vim." I look over to his screen and there it is, a fully customized Emacs window. Nowadays people still ask me why that professor, who usually likes all of his students, can't look at me straight.
4548	Custom water cooling that has the radiator &amp; fans on the outside, of course!	It's summer time and my office gets ridiculously hot. I realize I can't exactly violate the laws of thermodynamics, but what do you guys do to mitigate the heat thrown out by your computers? This is my first summer in a new apartment and the upstairs has terrible cooling compared to the downstairs (no place to put the desk downstairs unfortunately). I have a steam link on the way to play couch/controller games in the cooler room, but I would still need a solution for anything that would require zero latency or mouse&amp;KB.
4549	I don't know why you're being downvoted, this is the most honest and accurate summary of Halo 5 I have ever read... and I'm a HUGE Halo fanboy.	Remember that Halo 5 does not have splitscreen (like, at all) if that was a big deal for you in past Halo games. On the bright side, DLC maps are free. On the downside, theres not a lot of variety in setting(take you pick from one covenant themed map and a million UNSC ones!), and Warzone has microtransactions to make up for the cost of free maps. 343 is also very slow to add things (infection, one of the most popular gametypes was added 8 months after launch, and the game had Forge patched in post-launch). Also, armor customization was downgraded (pick a helmet, a visor color, and a set of chestplate+shoulders+everything else; in other words, no asymmetric shoulders or the like). Halo 5 is 60 FPS, but drops are not uncommon, and animations outside of a "bubble" around the player are reduced to 30, which can be jarring. Also, the campaign is pretty but garbage storywise. Tl;dr 343 takes one step back for every step forward Also, Halo 5 customs and Forge are coming to Windows 10 soonTM

Daylight is the best to take pictures in, even if it's next to a window. Take bunch of them at the same time, even if it feels fucking dumb, like 30 or so and choose the best one.
4581	Looks like a zerg rush	One word to describe this image-Horrendous
4582	I don't even know anymore.	Fish are pretty boring.
4583	Do they taste like normal cherry tomatoes?	Yep you can also graft a cherry tomato plant onto a potato plant and get a Pomato plant.
4584	Don't forget Virtanen, hopefully he trained hard this offseason.	I think so. He should be able to slaughter with the twins. Plus if Rodin can work out that's huge, Baertschi playing his new working role with Bo, healthy Sutter and Edler, Gudbranson is an upgrade, split schedule with Miller and Markstrom... I see us being a wildcard team.

4586	Did u try shooting it?	Behold... The never ending rocket arm!
4587	Or just pay out a basic weekly income and then have taxes one every other form of income.	How do you determine payment amount? People's circumstances can change dramatically in a year. The point is with it done as a negative income tax, you can see annual earnings and then pay out based on that.
4588	B-But where would I put my salt, butthurt and votes for Donald Trump to?	OK, and now if everyone will stop placing or displacing blame ... can we please focus on actually identifying and encouraging options for reforms (including Islamic reform) that might prevent such easy abuse of the religion?
4589	Sigh... And you are too dense to understand that metacanada exists for 'special' people like you.	Oh, it's not off topic. You are just too dense to understand why it completely applies to Canada just as much as America or Europe, or anywhere else in the world where there are dumb shit SJW's.
4590	Yeah, unfortunately I've had to watch/help administer narcan and they do come back in complete withdrawl and not feeling even remotely good but then again they're not dead...	Yep. naloxone is much faster than putting someone on a ventilator (which would surely work, we fix way worse breathing problems with a vent). I'm sure naloxone is not very comfy though.
4591	Sounds kinda racist.	Whitelist Clan members So basically how this works is that when a member is placed on the whitelist, they are free to join the clan without anyone having to accept them in an Invite-Only clan (maybe even allow this if the clan is closed). This would allow trusted members to go visit other clans and easily return home without having to have someone accept them when they wish to come back.
4592	Pretty sure he was joking because thats what Connor said when he lost.	and better.

4600	Depends if the clock is analogue or digital.	stopped clock is right twice a day
4601	*angry seething sounds*	Watch out, guys. It looks like their going to use violence to settle there differences over they're.
4602	It made national news so.	Let's see if this incident gets nationwide coverage.
4603	Just sleep... I didn't see any option for steps	Do you know what data syncs between Fitbit and s-health?
4604	Hmm interesting, does the 200 credit active bounty have a short or a long timer?	I got the same thing and the security forces scan me at the nav beacon and it becomes 200CR active bounty again every damn time. I even bought a sidewinder and died in it and it did not remove it. Fuck.
4605	They used to look the same, but after spending eons inside the Aether, they changed.	Do Apothicon's and Keepers look the same? I'm kinda having a hard time understanding this part. How some of the keepers came under the corruption of the dark aether and became Apothicon's. So do they look the same? Or do we have yet to see and Apothicon?
4606	I'm actually quite surprised considering the fact that the current party in charge of Australia (LNP) cut the funding to many, many things that benefited the people of Austalia, one being the CSIRO.	Australia is leading the world in the development of the true practical GENERAL quantum computer. Why it's not the USA, I don't know.(Too busy with political/cultural infighting is my guess...) But I'm glad that SOMEONE cares enough to do so.
4607	The Reef wasn't, why would the new one be?	I realized something about the Rise of iron. We obviously know that we get a new social space in rise of iron. But what if Xur appears there too? If the new social space is locked behind the Rise of iron DLC, and Xur appears there. People without Rise of iron will be unable to get to Xur. And miss what Xur sells on the weekends.
4608	Yes and everyone left of centre is a marxist.	You cannot be both conservative and liberal. It's illogical, unless one's willing to be honest and express that they're liberal with a touch of phobia-ism. Or confused.
4609	Literally within 2 hours of the result certain outlets were pushing the narrative that people regretted their vote, or that people were googling "what is the EU".	Not surprising, "Bregret" has always been a slimy media smear.
4610	How about we don't believe anybody and have the regulatory agencies do their own testing?	Digging into Dieselgate: EU parliament looks into emissions cheating -- It's not just Volkswagen: it's all car manufacturers that are cheating on emissions, if activists are to be believed. European parliamentarians now want to get to the bottom of what's been coined 'Dieselgate'

4626	The more I look into RE the less it fits into my simple life.	Very cool. Thanks and yes reading that sub since some time.
4627	Feels over reals, motherfuckers!	Well looks like CTR is here to $hill against Eric by using their biased "facts" and reality. We all know that facts have a liberal bias. Besides, it doesn't matter what the truth is, it matters what I *feel.*

4629	Ahgotnoosfourya.	Shawn Michaels has got some news for ya.
4630	Yeah but she can be the first female president.	Shes not a good candidate. At all. Her arrogance to run while under investigation is damaging her party.

4635	Is that a Winston spray?	I really like PRIMAL PUNCH kid and I don't know why.

4639	"But it's gen 1, so it is perfect and you can't complain about it."	Seel and Dewgong. Krabby. Volt+Orb and Electrode. Muk. Sand+Shrew. These are exactly the type of names you are complaining about.
4640	A dozen, just like how many first overall picks you had!	Yeah, everything in there has been said a dozen times over again.
4641	Silly gay boy, you're secretly being oppressed by the patriarchy and it's allowing you to think you're free from its control.	Of course, because in their minds, everyday of their lives they are abused, broken, and belittled to such a wild extreme that they have to shame the rest of the world and make them believe they are doing wrong. I'm a gay dude and I dislike the LGBTQRSTUVBBQQ groups so much because they enjoy telling me how oppressed I am and how hostile the world is to me. Fuck that noise. Is my life perfect? Nope. But I don't see the shadowy anti-gays out to get me everyday so I think I'm doing alright.
4642	Ah the classic "make a bad choice, then blame someone else" approach.	You should consider a class action lawsuit against them. Explore your options. Do not even consider paying that full ammount.
4643	It's called anal vore in others.	In the gay community, that's what we call a power bottom

4649	Maybe that's what Lion is: an organic-Gem hybrid that Rose made as an early experiment; it was her prototype for the process that created Steven...	I agree, if he did it completely. But I also think that he would keep his own brain if he were to shapeshift, that and half of his sense of self is in his gen: Perhaps he would end up somewhat like Lion where he is self aware but not completely

4653	Well we can't be having the peasants being all uppity thinking they shouldn't have to make difficult choices between rent or food now can we	It's find a better job then quit. We're talking about low wage earners, likely living paycheck to paycheck, maybe even happy just to be gainfully employed, not self righteous cunts.
4654	SEGA and Toaplan	If you could only collect for two companies what would they be? And why? Chose from Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Sega, Atari, etc. but you can only collect for two of them.
4655	Well no one rang the bell, why should he stop if no one asked to get off?	Actually, I once had a driver on the 6 Bay go past Bay Station because no one rang the bell. There were 50 people on the bus and 90% of them wanted to get off at Bay Station. Everyone started yelling when the bus past the station, and he let us off at Yorkville.

4664	Pretty much.	So a comparison between Bud Light and Hoegaarden would be like a match between India and Germany ?
4665	.5 W would be 27dBm	I think it can do 20dBm or .5W Now, I upped my (other wifi card) to 30dBm which is 1W, and I used a small stick on heatsink and it's totally fine. I want to get another card that's rated to 2W (33 dBm), and see how that goes.
4666	Okay there HAS to be a good story to go with that	I was making a bad joke, besides, last time I participated in a blood drive I got my license revoked

4672	Wow, another thing they screwed up on	Have you noticed that Ikora's eyes turn different colors?
4673	Yeah, Pep is just not on the same level as those coaches	One of these is not like the others..
4674	I remember WoW in which.... THERE WEREN'T FOUR THOUSAND OF THESE STUPID NOSTALGIA POSTS ALL THE SUCKING TIME GET A SUCKING LIFE	Lets play a game: I remember WoW in which... Post something you remember from old timey WoW. Somethint that was fun, something that made you angry or something you though just didn't make sense. For example I remember WoW in which you had to carry your mounts in your bag.
4675	C9 finished 3rd place in regular season without Hai , they must be really bad	Eh idk. C9 looked pretty bad without Hai, I feel like if this team stayed together it would be up to contractz to shot call which might be an issue because of how new he is.

4680	Yes, I've seen some in my local lake that had to of weighed at least 5lbs.	This may be a stupid question but is it true goldfish will keep growing if given the proper room? Like there's no set size a goldfish can reach (within reason of course)
4681	I've noticed this happening more and more, I feel like it's because reddit is getting stale	Every time my wife shows me something on facebook before I see it on reddit I feel like all of you have failed me.
4682	yep and casting white people as asians are fine	They "cast white people for everything" because they make up 75% of the US population. This is not racism nor hard to understand. No I'm not white.
4683	Great reaction ey.	I'm curious how No mans sky will launch. It almost certainly won't live up to the hype, and will probably be a similar story to watchdogs. I'm curious how people will react now that it won't be Ubi$oft but a small indie team.
4684	That family made a sign specifically asking for his shoes lol...pander much?	Stephen Curry Gives a Lucky Young Fan His Haight Street Shoes After Scoring 51 Against The Magic
4685	I live in the city center and tourism made me reach the point where I actively do whatever I can to piss off tourists(staying on the legal side always), because they ring the door bell drunk at night(usually british) or they start to fight yelling at 4am(british again) or they just stay in a group of 10 to 30 persons in the middle of the street blocking everyone(germans this time) or just act like assholes 24/7(Italians mostly).	Yeah, that's the impression I've been getting as well: that the tourism is now so heavily present in Barcelona that at times the quality of life of the locals is negatively affected. I'd be pissed off at that as well. Barcelona is a very 'rich' city in history, culture and identity and it must be hard to see the place you love turn into a huge tourist mill, most of said tourists probably not even *that* interested in the city itself, they just wanted to have been there. Take a picture on the famous square, buy a Neymar shirt. "I've been to Barcelona!". Well, do you know how to order a cup of coffee in Catalan? No? Then you haven't experienced Barcelona.

4690	African or European?	Doesn't seem to let me view the folder, it starts to load it but I think the &amp; in your folder name is messing with the URL, which is a really stupid thing for Dropbox to not compensate for. But regardless, you need to sprinkle a few specific questions into the form, just for laughs: What is your name? What is your quest? What is your favorite colour? What is the capital of Assyria? What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

4695	Well that blows.	Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think that feature has been available on any Samsung device since the Note 4. My Note 5 couldn't do it either and I'm not sure there is a workaround.
4696	I think it is pretty obvious what you need to do now OP	Goodbye
4697	Why is why Spain is definitely very Muslim	You don't seem to understand what kind of insidious cancer islam is. Read the book review of Among The Believers. Wherever it takes hold, islam replaces native cultures. It's systematic and intentional. "Islam" means "submission".
4698	Why yes, thanks to colonialism all of the natives from North and South America were given a peaceful, relaxing life!1	What my alt-right friend is apparently thinking in history class
4699	You're obviously entitled and have everything because you have iPhones!	Why aren't millenials buying houses? Why aren't millenials buying cars? Why aren't millenials buying diamonds? Why are people even asking these questions? It's because we're broke as shit!

4701	Since when has whatever china thinks been important?	2 of which are very popular in East Asia. I was at Singapore Airport Friday evening and I was watching the semifinal between a Chinese and a Malaysian badminton player in a sports bar. When the Malaysian won, a woman next to me started crying. There are definitely people who care about these sports, as least as much as swimming.
4702	No problem, just saw that it didn't look like you got a fix :)	Thanks! I got it fixed already
4703	You are supposed to hate everything from Halo 4, because it sucks	Hate on Halo 4 all you want, but that map was good.

4707	running 39 cards and hoping the opponent doesn't notice	Dracopal players, how are you proceeding without Monkeyboard? Pretty self explanatory. I'm seeing a few people throwing in a third Lizardraw to replace Monkeyboard, but I was wondering what others think is the best way to go. I know a few Performapals have come out in the last few packs, are any of those worth trying? Will Ariadne see more play again? What are you all doing?
4708	they do not have the best Prime Minister though	Rated as best embassy in London by the North Korea Magazine.
4709	But he speaks American!	Linguist here. No, it isn't. Especially not when you're already speaking a Germanic language.
4710	Oh, man, I remember that episode... I actually feel really bad for Ranma's temporary feminine persona - she just wants to be a girl, but everyone (sans Happosai) bullies her until she hits her head and becomes a "he" again.	In retrospect the most painful part of the "am I pretty" Ranma episode is how much the whole thing is played as inherently a joke.
4711	He should have put his e-brake on and Tokyo-drifted into that merge lane that was empty that the Taurus should have been in.	He hopped lanes because he was going to run into the Taurus otherwise, numb nuts.
4712	Seeing as Rabs is nearing retirement, let's put him full time in the Bunker!	The bunker itself is fine, the only problem is that it's still manned by the same referees that are prone to inconsistent or confusing decisions. But that will always be a problem unless we made all rules black and white (which is a bad idea) or trained autonomous robots to referee the game.
4713	thanks, I'm multitasking on Elite:Dangerous right now :)	Should this have a flair to indicate?
4714	It must have been your fault, for speaking to them in english...	I (franco) lived in the west island fo 10 years. All my neighbours were anglo. Super nice people. Sending their kids to John Rennie HS and places like that. All of their kids now live in Ontario because their terrible french was hurting them finding a job here.
4715	Well, OKC rarely ever plays team basketball, whereas you guys run an offense pretty similar to ours.	After seeing Durant and Westbrook get shit on by 40 this is great
4716	:)	It's a natural response to be suspicious of what is unknown to you. As time goes on people open up more and understand one another better, I believe the same will happen with our Syrian brothers and sisters.
4717	Target fixation is mostly a two wheels thing, presumably because you can only turn through countersteering, so it's rather more involved than simply setting the steering wheel to match the curvature of the road.	Is target fixation *more* of a motorcycle thing? I've heard of it with cars where, for example, somebody sees somebody stopped on the side of the road and unknowingly steers toward it because they are looking at it. Same thing? Because, honestly, that sounds like a pretty dumb thing to me as a car driver. Does being on a motorcycle affect that kind of thing more due to the mechanics of the ride or something?
4718	And FUCK THE SILVER TIPS!	Come on up to Beautiful Everett, AMERICA'S town! This is a land of pure majesty, so close to nature that shoppers at the city's Broadway QFC have bowie knives on their belts in case they need to hunt the meat themselves! Crack heads? Meth heads? People who nearly kill you with ninja stars as you walk by? We got 'em all, possibly living in sheds off alleyways! Up in Historic North Everett, you might be treated to a nighttime yell -fest from a drunk neighbor looking for her chickens. Or, if you're an early bird, witness the car prowlers set off car alarms at 5AM. Watch as the completely unphased owner simply responds with "The alarm will go off whenever you touch the door, so just stop prowling, guy." Beauty. If you're a runner, you can run on our sleepy streets with well maintained sidewalks. Maybe get a view of the ocean or the mountains...maybe find the remnants of a cake and a 2" switchblade. WHO KNOWS?!? But the flavor doesn't stop where our land ends. In the waves, even our gangs of transient Orca whales sometimes randomly attack other, larger whales for no apparent reason! So come on up to Everett: a city full of goons, just waiting for our skill guys
4719	Bit more tuck and he would have come around	And he did. Nailed it right with his head.
4720	All capitalists should be hung.	Why the Minutemen offer the best hope for the Commonwealth. While the Brotherhood and the Institute may have superior technology the CULTURE promoted by the Minutemen is what is truly what's most beneficial. I don't even mean this in the "We got to be free!" sense but even from a purely technological standpoint the Minutemen offer the greatest hope for survival. Consider the technological "advancement" made by the Institute in the past two hundred years. Synths and teleportation. That's about it. While both of these are amazing on their own right consider the technological advances made in the United States in the past two hundred years. Despite beginning with a society blessed with enormous intellectual powerhouses and access to some of the most advanced facilities in the world they have made remarkably few gains in terms of advancement. The brotherhood of steel is almost as stagnant, still using prewar tech as a mainstay with little innovation. However a free society is meteoric in its ability to adapt, expand, grow, and innovate. Trade, open politics, capitalism, and so forth are some of the most powerful engines for advancement our world has ever seen. And these things are most likely to persevere under the minutemen and to a lesser extent, the railroad.

4755	Have you ever played FM?	The influence of managers I need to get something off my chest: I think the influence of the manager is greatly, greatly overstated. It frustrates me to no end. I cry myself to sleep every night. First of all, managers are supposed to motivate players. Am I naive in presuming that athletes that play a competitive sport have an inherent motivation (except maybe Balotelli)? There's a fuckload of reasons to be motivated as a football player: Money, silverware, glory, admiration, opportunities, legacy etc. Do these players need some old guy yelling 'Come on!'? Also, if motivation *does* play a role, are great motivators all that rare? Second, the notion that godlike tactical knowledge is only in the hands of a select few: Mourinho, Guardiola, Ancelotti etc. Football is not rocket science. I don't find it at all impressive to be succesful with a team like Barcelona or Real Madrid as a manager. A dead snail could manage Barcelona and be succesful. They should try that. Also, I've yet to hear a manager say something insightful in a post-match interview. What is it that managers bring to the table? What does it means when Mourinho *works his magic*? What does it mean when Ancelotti is a *cup-manager*? The careers of managers are highly volatile. For example, Ranieri loses to Faroe Islands, yet wins the Premier League with a relegation candidate. What sense is there to make of this? Look at Van Gaal, Del Bosque, Koeman, Ancelotti, Pellegrini, Van Marwijk, Klopp, even Mourinho etc. All these managers have had quite a lot of (inexplicable) ups and downs. I'm not saying that teams shouldn't have managers. It's a good idea to have someone that calls the shots, talks to the press etc. You also need a field to play on, yet nobody is praising the grass blades, even if they're doing a fine job. Ultimately, my problem is the unwarranted praise and hate managers receive, in the real world, but especially on here. It's all people talk about. I don't want to sound like an asshole, but it honestly sickens me. I believe in the talent of the players, the squad. Not some old guy who likes football, standing on the sidelines, chewing gum. If there's anything managers *should* be doing, is making sure players behave. Even this they don't manage. How hard is it to make sure Arnautovic doesn't behave like a dickhead every game? How hard is it to make sure that Robben doesn't dive every other game? At least make the players behave. If anybody has seen The Office (US), there's a great scene where Michael desperately wants his girlfriend to acknowledge that the awful human being that is Packer is funnier than him. Michael enjoys his place in the shadow. I suspect something similar is going on here. I find it to be a bit disturbing. Does any of this make sense or am I an idiot?
4756	That doesnt matter all that matters is that THE SOLDIER knows the truth.	Didn't Hitler die before the nukes and didn't NATO make Israel in 1947
4757	Sorry!	What a save!
4758	Bolding your words really makes your statements so much more accurate.	That's not what it says at all. What it says is, just because you are passionate about a job, doesn't mean squat. Are you good at it? Can **you** be successful at it? If you can't answer yes to either of those, it's probably not for you. If you have lots of money, do whatever the hell you want. If you need to think about putting food on the table, find something you're good at and **do that**. Following dreams works for the few it works for and the rest just find out how harsh the world is.
4759	But at least there are no more bots or gold sellers!	In the first Q&amp;A they vaguely mentioned something about planning to reduce trade restrictions, market may or may not be included with that. However nothing has been done yet and nothing was said about it in the second Q&amp;A. Its just another poorly implemented system by IMC, something ToS players should be used to by now and have come to accept that this is how the game will be for the most part, with some oh so slow minor improvements along the way of course.

Somehow yesterday we got on the subject of Christmas. He decided that, once we put up the Christmas tree, we'd just have to keep Tiny Q in her room. For the whole Christmas season. Because that's going to work. Same SO who feels that toddler leashes aren't an option, even though Tiny Q has outgrown her stroller, regularly pulls her hand out of mine and bolts toward danger, and has developmental disability- so she functions at a "younger" stage than other kids her age. He thinks I should simply carry her. She's 33lbs! He never takes her anywhere. Of course it's simple to carry a squirmy 33lb chid with the strength of the hulk through a huge parking lot and while walking what seems like miles through the hospital several times a week to all her appointments.

But a white person assuming something is 'black culture' is racist. Also, race is a social construct, created by the evil white race - who actually never really created anything original. 'White culture' doesn't exist, except when it does, in which case it is built around white supremacy and institutional racism. White people are the only ones ever to wage war and conquer anything, but they're also weak and pathetic. I don't think George Orwell could have been any more prophetic when he invented the concept of doublethink.

4832	Sounds like you're projecting	Stop me if you've heard this one before. You decide to queue up for matchmaking because it's faster than casual. You click your medal while waiting and lament that you often don't get so much as a double flip. The game connects you fairly quickly and you're off to play competitive! As you load the game and look at your team, you quickly realize you have a Pyro, a Sniper and an Engie. You may also have a soldier that's clearly struggling with rocket jumps and rollouts. If and when you look around the map, the only off-class the other team has is a Heavy. You sigh a bit, resigned to the idea you're probably gonna lose this match and decide it's best you just get this over with. Unfortunately, there's *that guy* with his Windows 98 potato that's trying to connect to the server still, and all of you are held hostage until he connects. You wonder if this is a matter of playing on a potato or having slow internet, and it's around this time you notice all of you are playing on a Tokyo server despite the fact that 90% of you have ping above 150. The guy fails to connect within the 3 minutes or whatever that the game is willing to wait on him, so the game replaces him with another potato enthusiast who finally connects after 120 seconds. The game is finally about to start, the last guy to connect has chosen Spy. You point out that your team NEEDS a medic, the Pyro is quick to tell you to stop complaining and switch then. You wind up switching briefly before you realize whichever team member is the gibusvisioniest decided he'll do it, usually the Engie or (Huntsman) Sniper. You are free to switch back. When the game starts, you rationalize your team is dead weight and decide to go for a flank or some other pivotal play, because this is a situation where you *need* to go big or go home. You're getting to mid as fast as possible so you can get a good position to make something happen, and as you look around you, you realize your team is nowhere to be seen. Strangely, their team isn't either. Because of this, you go deep. You start pushing towards their second from the flank route, hoping you'll get a nice, excellent flank where you can demolish the combo from behind. As you push through the flank route, you encounter nobody whatsoever and you find yourself thankful for your luck, because it means no one will see you until it's too late and no one will be able to call you out. But then, as you begin wrapping back around to flank the main path, the MOMENT you hit that last corner, you're taking fire....from behind. Somehow, their entire team, from the demo to the scout to the heavy, is stupidly slow on the rollout, to the point where you actually reached their second before they did. When you turned that corner to flank them at main at mid, they were actually behind you, having just left the spawn. You die immediately. As you sit there waiting on your respawn, you watch as your team finally approaches mid. You notice your Pyro has the giant view models and the default FoV, taking that as evidence this guy must be brand new to the game. He charges full speed at the enemy heavy and dies immediately without even coming remotely close to lighting him on fire. Your soldier beefs a basic rocket jump onto the high ground and gets picked off during the attempt, your engie is calmly trying to build a level 1 in the middle of the battlefield, not grasping the urgency of the situation. Upon engie's death, med decides to whip out his syringe gun (yes syringe gun, not crossbow) and take out the enemy team himself, dying rather quickly. At this point you've spawn but you're certain mid is theirs and what's more they've got absolute uber advantage. By the time you reach second however, you notice they stopped capping mid at about 25%. You look at the scoreboard and killfeed and realize that somehow your Spy has managed to kill four of them on his own. You hesitate a bit, but you make your way to mid, where you find Scout and Med fighting your spy. The moment you fire a shot, your Spy cloaks out and leaves you to fight them alone, in which case you either die to the pocketed scout or you do JUST enough to scare them off, but likewise need to retreat for health yourself. Now having an opportunity to flank and make dents WITHOUT dying to surprising levels of stupidity, you're doing pretty well, and you and your Spy (who is mysteriously quite effective) are the only ones with points above 10. Your medic continues to syringe gun anyone that attacks his pocket, engie is missing from the fight entirely while building a sentry in a worthless spot, soldier manages a kill every third life or so, and Pyro insists that if Pyro is winning the current election, surely Pyro can defeat Heavy in single combat as he continues to run straight at him. Alas, no matter how much work you put in, it's a slow burn. Two competent players that aren't working directly together cannot win a fight alone. Every fight over a point where you don't kill their medic is a fight where they'll advance to the next point. For the rare times you completely wipe them and you cap a point back, your team seems to be of the opinion they need to remain at the point AFTER the front line and wait until the front line moves up before they can advance (aka if the fight is at second, they hold last. At mid? They hold second). Due to all of this, you slowly but surely fall and lose the game, no matter how many points you accrue. When the scoreboard shows, you're at the top, gold medals in every category. You have AT LEAST 18 more kills than the next best player, and surprisingly you see that their team was garbage too and has very few kills to their names, though they still won. You hope that all those gold medals count for something and that hopefully they'll counteract the progress you'll lose a bit. You won last game, and thus you have exactly one win worth of EXP. As you see your EXP drain, you notice a sliver that must be 1/10th the size of a bar remains, the game awarding you for your gold medals. You queue up again because you are an idiot, but this time you manage a double flip click while waiting, so it was all worth it.

4867	People who dont have stuff want free stuff, OMG!	Yeah, and the pace at which the general public are getting up to speed with the concept of UBI, is really surprising
4868	being loud is not alpha...	In general, are Irish men alpha or beta? While traveling abroad I've come into contact with plenty of different nationalities in hostels and bars. After a while you begin to notice common traits. Australians are alpha males - they're loud, dominate the room once they enter, up for fun, exhibit macho behavior and usually have no trouble charming the ladies. Americans too are very confident and often lead the pack. Irish men on the other are quite shy and reserved without a few pints in them. They won't initiate conversation and only speak when spoken too. Classic beta male behavior. I'm speaking in general terms of course, but have you noticed similar patterns?

4872	The Daryl and Ezekiel love story just got interesting.	Anyone else think Daryl will pick up Comic Michonne's storyline? (Comic and Telltale Game Spoilers ahead) He seems like the perfect person to leave the group after All Out War and make contact with Oceanside. The TV Michonne is so much more stable and positive than her comic counterpart and what with her becoming a partner to Rick and a mother to Carl it is hard to imagine her attempting (or contemplating) suicide or leaving the group on a self-destructive journey of self-discovery. Daryl on the other hand has been itching to leave the safety of Alexandria ever since they arrived. Obviously TV Carol could also do this but they've already played that card on the show and presumably she will return to the group soon. I'm not sure viewers could tolerate anymore narrative flip-flopping from her. Also, a Captain Jack, pirate styled Daryl could be a fangirl goldmine?
4873	but jews don't add to diversity like the middle eastern and africans...	Because Jews tend to be more value-added citizens. Jews are more likely to be college educated, have higher incomes and not need welfare. Contrast this to a lot of the low-income people of North African and Middle Eastern origin that are driving Jews away. It's a loss for the country losing its Jews.

4879	Out of curiosity, why does it matter if your wife is from the states?	Cross border thoughts. Or where should I open a business? Hey all, I'm looking to see if any of you have traveled down this path? I'm starting to see some cashflow from some ecom ventures I've got going. I'm going to get hit pretty hard personally from taxes this year up in Canada and possibly USA from the fact I have an American wife. I don't mind paying taxes, I do mind paying more than I have to. I'm going to open a company (depending on what my Finance guy says) but he's not well versed on cross border stuff. Canada he's amazing, (am I allowed to give his site a shout out here?). He's going to refer me to a guy about cross border taxes but he's pricey and I want to make sure I"m asking the right questions. So first big question is, should I incorporate in the USA or Canada and why? Most of my expenses are in USD currently most of my profit is in AUD but that can change once I set it all up... anybody who's gone before me on something like this? What was your experience? Any other thoughts?

Gay rights are not,not by a long shot,measure of sucesufull societies.

4893	Your logic, rational analysis, and fact-based conclusion is unwelcome here.	The confusion is because the author's one-line conclusion doesn't match the paragraphs of text leading up to it. In the actual text, the author says frameworks are restrictive and unnecessary, that they don't improve development, and that we only use them because we've been verbally abused into doing so. The text makes it clear the author doesn't like using frameworks *ever*.

Is it still a "bad" drug or is it like pot and should be legalised and sold at Coles besides the cigarettes? Are there any "bad" drugs to someone who is pro Pot?, like something that fucks lives up so badly even they feel it's an illicit substance? Apart for alcohol and tobacco?
4907	Wow, you must have an awful balance of career and family!	I...don't understand the connection...
4908	but but but, it's all natural!	From a nutritional standpoint. Natural maple syrup is just as bad. It's pure sugar. High fructose corn syrup is 55% fructose 45% glucose. Maple syrup is 95% sucrose which is a disaccharide composed of... glucose and fructose. Sure maple syrup might have a bit of manganese and other trace micronutrients. But that's no saving grace.

4911	Except the well-off professionals in North Sydney who apparently couldn't stomach voting for Greens even without a Labor candidate on offer	It's more a natural realignment since the country has moved right since Hawke/Keating. The Liberal Party dominates all of the right-wing, the ALP is centrist and soft-right and the Greens picked up the Whitlam-era ALP voters, and increasingly the well-off professionals in the inner-city who can afford to vote Greens.

No, it's my body and it's not a spectacle. I also get comments on any status update or picture I post - a cute picture of my dog erupted in to a bunch of "how are you feeling?" "When is your due date??" "Did you find out the sex??" I was sooooo tempted to be like...My dog is great, and we've been *pretty sure* he's a boy for years, oh and he's definitely not pregnant!

I'm seeing Milo Yiannopoulus, the Gavin beard guy and all these alt-right figures invoking "free speech." I often hear them saying "free speech is what made america great, and regressive left PC is taking it away." Like, do these people know a single thing about american history? Only **50** years ago you literally had all aspects of public life completely racially-segregated in the south!! (public schools, public spaces, public transportation, restrooms, restaurants, drinking fountains, military, federal workplaces, ETC). I will repeat, this was lasted until **50** years ago!!! Seriously, what the hell are people talking about free speech!? Reactionaries need to stop projecting modern phenomena in to the "eternal glorious past." The concept of "free speech" that circulates on the web and Dave Rubin podcasts, is extremely contemporary phenomena! Rant over.

Or better yet bring Raw back to 2 hours, 3 hours is far too long.
4994	Surely it's your hair, not hers, so it's up to you what gets done to it.	Me with my girlfriend (maybe ex?) together 3 years, I cut my hair and she now is not speaking to me I guess I have fucked up and I don't know what to do to fix this. I have always had longer hair, not like Jesus long or anything but it has always been down to right at the bottom of my ears. I've just always had it like that, no real reason. Well this summer has been fucking hot, I mean hot like sitting with my face buried the AC hot. Well just my luck that my job has undertaken an outdoor project that I have to supervise for 8 hours a day. It has been like going to hell every day (I am not built for heat). With my super sweaty hair making me miserable every single day. I tell my g/f that I want to cut my hair just for the summer because it is killing me. She jokingly tells me that I can't cut my hair because it would change my entire looks and she said she would make me a sweat band to wear instead. She is laughing this whole time and is in a good mood. I thought she was kidding. So the next day is hotter than the last few and I can't take it anymore, I go to the barber after work and I have him cut my hair. I'll admit it is short and yes even I admit that it changes the way I look. In fact my barber laughed and said it was a whole new me. I went home from work and she see's me and I could physically see her demeanor change from happy to sad to angry. She at first doesn't talk to me but eventually once she takes a few min. alone (I know she went and cried) she comes out and tells me that she is very disappointed. The long story short version is that she is upset both at my physical appearance but more so that I disregarded her feelings and offer of making me a sweatband. We went back and forth for awhile but in the end she said she had to have some time to think about things because it bothered her so much that I did not take her feelings into consideration. That was two day's ago, she went to stay with her sister btw, and I have no idea today where we stand. There is a par t of me that is kind of upset over the whole ordeal because I feel like it is my head and she doesn't have to stand out in the fucking hot sun all day (she works in a nice AC'd office). But then there is a part of me that deeply regrets this because maybe I should have taken her seriously. I thought she was joking. It was never my intention to do this to spite her. I'm not even doing this for my own looks or anything other than just to not look like a stringy mutt dog with my hair soaked in sweat every day. Plus did I mention it's fucking hot. Anyway I want to fix this. I am not going to cut my hair like this again. I know it will take a few months but it will grow back. But how do I fix the damage I've done by not doing what she wished. Like I said I never did this to spite her, if I would have known it would have upset her this much I would never have done it. (I guess I'd just suffer the heat stroke I was working on) **tl;dr**: Cut my hair because it is hot, g/f did not want me to do this and I thought she was joking. She wasn't and is now not talking to me

5008	That's some DLC I'd play the shit out of.	Well, it's hard to say for certain. I'd argue that plot developments in the game could explain his... sustained existence, shall we say? But I'd rather think of an unstable Mr Handy going around making sure he survived at all costs.
5009	i've run the numbers and this checks out.	How about girls date girls and guys date girls and then we have more girls

5022	2 of them were Turn Down for what and PIMP	Hey m8 is there any chance of you posting the list of the songs you used in the video? Thx
5023	What you are looking for in c# is 'readonly' .	Your example has very little to do with immutability and does in particular not apply at all to the context when comparing a hypothetical "let" statement to "var". Those are for function local variable declarations, your's is a type definition. I'm talking about something similar to Java's "final" or C++'s "const" keywords.
5024	But they're an election-winning machine!	That feeling when you win an election but the elation feels marginal | Katharine Murphy | Australia news
5025	Yes, from what I've seen here it's mainly Europeans who mainly talk about immigrants destroying our culture	"Despite the attention that we get and how much we talk about race, we are far less racist and xenophobic than Europe. Half of Europe is homogeneous and the other half thinks the immigrants are destroying their countries."
5026	I hate that I can only see it 3 hours away	Tickled (2016) --- A journalist intends to document an international tickling competition for kicks. Instead, he finds a bizarre and even threatening world created by a bully with deep pockets.

5034	so most people on team mystic?	I'm sure a colour blind person, who can't read English and on team mystic would find this lovely
5035	Jail solves everything.	People usually go door to door selling things to buy drugs. It's probably so they can buy stronger drugs though. Sounds like an easy way to get clean though. You know, once they go to jail.
5036	When I used to play tdm I would play solo, so if I had to guess I would say 1 game winning streak	TDM game win streak (112) I just wanted to check my stats and I suddenly saw that my best TDM win streak is: 112!!!! Is this high or normal? What's your highest streak?

5043	I think the idea here is that the first behavior can lead to the other.	"Boys will be Boys" Is for when Tommy and Johnny are playing touch football and one of them gets a twisted ankle. Not when Tommy and Johnny sexually assault Jill.

5045	Stealing this method.	I was on the school bus one day and saw a girl poop into a newspaper, wrap it up nicely then have it passed down the bus to a girl she didn't like. It makes me die inside.
5046	I think he is coach for longzhu	What does he do now? Is he still a pro player?
5047	Zenyatta has a secondary fire?	Yes and no. His primary is down to 40 (from 45), but his secondary is buffed up to 40 (from 35). One overlooked buff in damage is how fast his Discord Orb reaches enemies now. His long-range DPS is higher now because now your Discords will land before your first attacks land at longer ranges. Before.. there were a lot of times where the Discord would finally reach my enemy after 2 Orbs of Destruction already landed on the target.

5051	Turn atheist and euphoric with the knowledge that you are free from the wretched, corrupting nature of religious thought.	Abstinence-only Sex Ed Oh my fucking lord. I know it's summer but this is still an important rant, I feel. My school enforces abstinence-only sexual education. It doesn't work. Instead of actually explaining anything, they dance around the idea of two non-married people having sex. They literally showed a fucking graph where it shows how likely each method of safe sex is. Guess the fuck what, the only thing they address is abstinence. And of course my Catholic health teacher absolutely eats that shit up. (Public school system by the way.) The fact that they just reiterate common fucking sense for like 2 months is fucking insane. It makes me want to gag thinking about it. They spew nonsense like "If you don't have sex, BAM! No babies!" Like NO FUCKING SHIT huh!?!? God DAMN it's so fucking STUPID! They might as well be showing us a fucking still image of two fucking people sitting in a room cause that's as deep as they get. Alright, I've blown off a fair bit of steam. I feel a little better already. /rant

5053	Could you be more specific about how this milk is used	printer (laser is ideal, as inkjet can bleed) and use milk as adhesive. I prefer the thicker, canvas-like papers as I find them easier to handle as well as looking better.
5054	Poor thing...the strain must have been too much on her.	Looks like she's removed her videos. How...strange...
5055	Uh I just ctrl+f small and that doesn't even show up	Yes. I'm on mobile so I can't link atm but if you go to the Geneva Conventions Wikipedia page and look at the sources on the bottom you should find the proof.
5056	That's what they want you to think!	Aaaaand this would be why there are no giant conspiracies plotted by brilliant minds. Just major fuck ups by normal people.
5057	Yeah that power connector really looks ancient, how old is the cat though?	At 18 she's not the prettiest girl anymore but she's still mine
5058	Yeah but they are "moderate"...	McCain promoted the arming of the Syrian moderate opposition which led to ISIS. He is a schmuck.

5060	heyyyyyyyyy D:	Combined
5061	And yes, cause I live by the CET timezone	or someone's slacking :P Ps which one is dan stone - macy? the one from FT FSOE Island set?
5062	And I thought the sauerkraut fest was in Phelps!	I drive to Medina from downtown twice a week. Plant farms can smell ATROCIOUS. I think it's cabbage farms out this way? I dunno what it is, but for like a solid month or two in the fall I have to roll up my windows and close my vents when I drive through because the smell is overpowering. Someone mentioned once it's because they don't harvest all of it? They leave some stuff to just rot in the fields to act as fertilizer/replenish the soil? I dunno if that's true or not. But the smell is definitely true.
5063	True, I never find anything edible on Netflix.	Netflix is alot like my fridge, full of food but nothing I want to eat.
5064	Yeah, I always imagined Dune as a softcore skin flick.	I wish HBO would make Dune. They did so well with GOT. Dune is just as good and expansive.
5065	While we're at it, I just killed a blue pack who dropped a Skyforth and a Kaom's.	can we get a rollback? lost uber set...
5066	Or in Spanish class, or through her ear gauge hole.	Real question is would it be on a horse.
5067	Well,they needed a sound guy and MC.	Seriously!? OP maybe its just from your description but it sounds like your "friend" gave you a lecture about priorities and putting his needs first over not wanting to see YOUR STALKER EX WHO YOU HAD A RESTRAINING ORDER OUT ON!? Friends do not do that. Please, please, please don't take this as accusatory or as anything other than my personal take on a situation I don't know a ton about but I think you might benefit from some therapy and some self exploration into the way you form relationships. The groom who was apparently a close enough friend to feel really bad that you missed his wedding couldn't be bothered to remember that you needed to take a restraining order out on your ex or for that matter understand exactly how big of a deal that is? Are you kidding? Honestly he sounds just as manipulative in a way as your ex. You felt bad enough about missing the wedding to buy them multiple gifts, take them out to dinner, and justify an absence that shouldn't have needed justifying if you're as close as you're implying you are. Now I'm only going on the info in your posts but seriously you need this guy in your life and really anyone who requires so much from you without giving you any consideration back about as much as you need your ex.
5068	i had 6 exosuit upgrade place on my starter planet.. i can carry so much carbon now	For you knuckleheads complaining about backpack size You dudes realize that EVERY SINGLE space station has an inventory upgrade, right??
5069	I guess, but wouldnt you get urayne in that area first?	Dude come on, please read the post. Obviously I know how nuzlocke works I just think there should be a different "area" for legendary pokemon like for Lanthan
5070	pc gaming so expensive.	for a pristine boxed copy of that game? i'd pay $50, mate.
5071	They just faked their deaths.	So how did the women die?
5072	Every thin FEMALE is an unhumane monster!	It's almost too easy on imgur

5077	wow, what realistic blood	I like gore, so I drew this quick Bonnie
5078	Dunno, it's not like they directly interfered, (at least from the gif it doesn't look like they did) they were just there and seapupper did whatever it needed to to survive.	Serious question: would it have been better to let nature take its course? Orcas gotta eat right? Same reason as to why nature documentary filmmakers don't interfere in the hunting scenes.
5079	You're right, 20 games for a deliberate slash to the face is unacceptable	I think 6 was on the low end of what was acceptable. I was expecting from 6-10 games. But people on this sub were calling for 15 and some people were saying 20 or even the rest of the season which was ridiculous.
5080	Yeah, I'm sure the FBI never asked Clinton about her intentions or did any investigation on it at all after a year of investigating.	Seriously? How does anyone defend not asking this question? If you think this wasn't a fraud of an investigaton, you're just not able to Think. What the actual fuck.
5081	Whats the difference	Probably Australia.
5082	But wearing skinny jeans would be like wearing single ply briefs	It's more health and safety. You can't expect to squat properly in skinny jeans, and dropping a dumbbell on your bare foot wouldn't tickle.

5088	Dude you are missing some killer games, like Knack.	What I've played so far on PS4: Destiny Uncharted 4 Ratchet &amp; Clank (which is a remake) That's it. What a joke.
5089	At Maha this past weekend he mentioned trying to get Fill in the Blank down to 3:30 for a TV appearance.	is it safe to assume a performance of Fill in the Blank, DD/KW is too long for TV
5090	it's cities skylines all over again!	It's useless unless you want to flood the park. Wait...
5091	because republicans don't care about black people, of course.	"But the reality is, white voters -- particularly white, college-educated Republicans -- have also voted habitually, for Republican presidential candidates who have made white protectionism, racial fear mongering and scapegoating features of their campaigns for most of the last 60 years. Most have simply done it more artistically than Trump. Now Trump is trying to mimic that which has worked. Why does that mean Trump's black voter appeals are really aimed at educated white Republicans?"
5092	It's 'logged' you asshole as in they 'logged' several items out of my ass, which based on size is considered a ship too.	My sincerest apologies young man but I believe this was lodged up your ass. *removes ten foot pole*
5093	Green but not renewable.	Nuclear energy is green energy! What a crappy title.
5094	Yeah, instead there should something basic, like proving you're eligible to vote.	If I didn't believe in people's right to be ignorant and uninformed I would support a civics exam as a requirement to vote.
5095	CNN will be all over this !	Disgusting race hustling: Hillary Releases Ad Linking Trump to KKK, Turns Out People in Video are Paid Actors, Not Klansman
5096	I did know reaper had hair	Sniper gave me a haircut
5097	The fact that wilder is a meme means that he will never truly die.	The Imgur community, gatekeepers of Gene Wilder.
5098	How should that be relevant?	You must not have been around during Halo 2 multiplayer days then.
5099	THEN BUILD TANK ON ADC	Yet people keep saying this is best adc meta becuase adcs are played in everyrole expect support atm. What they fail to notice is that is at lcs level. Where team coordination is at its peak. In a solo que enviroment adc is suffering atm. Becuase of tanks doing insane dmg so early on. while also being able to get cdr for so cheap.
5100	Not even the Leafs!	Toronto teams never win Game 1. Not the Raptors. Not the Blue Jays. No one.
5101	Yo, nothin' says Reach nostalgia like a new Phaeton!	There's no Falcon in the next update...
5102	its also her house, but she will get the kneiv	sell ur house and get it kappa
5103	Because it's their body and no man should have control over it!	Whaaaaaaaaat? Who fought for this change? Look, this politically correct movement has given us an opportunity to talk about a lot of good things but it also makes way for ridiculous crap like this. I suppose if you are pregnant you have the right to drink your child into FAS or death, but your bartender has the right to not help your dumb ass do it. Seriously, how does this happen?
5104	#ISLAM IS THE RELIGION OF PEACE #NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE VIOLENT	Words actually fail me this time. I can't even caption this. I'm just...I think they call this level of anger righteous indignation.
5105	Forgot my	What the fuck? I don't believe any of the conspiracy theories and I'm a shill?
5106	10:00 pm start times yayyyy	indeed it does. thanks, I will do my best. theres family here so i can chill mostly rent free. so thats great. itll be a bit harder to follow the jackets but ill do my best!
5107	also "SUPPLY DROPS" that would be good too	Are we gonna get dance moves in patch 4.0? I just want the complete Call of duty experience you know?
5108	EVE Online?	How is there no proper GoT MMO on the Horizon? The only multiplayer game I know for Game of Thrones is going to be a browser based game. How has no one started a proper AAA Game of Thrones MMO? I mean you have so much to work with, dragons, giants, wolves, stone men, bandits, pirates etc etc as for workable classes, you could have Westeros knights, northmen hunters, wildling wargs, Braavos sword masters, Dothraki "barbarians" red priests, etc etc. There's so much to work with.
5109	IT TELLS ME THAT WE SHOULD BE NICER TO THE TERRORISTS!	If I believe that Trump has the best policies, then the fact that he may antagonize a terrorist won't change my opinion. That is literally the terrorists threatening us away from what we think way be best for our country. If terrorist don't like him, and they fundamentally disagree with western values, what does that tell you?
5110	No one else is hyped, we're actually rather uninterested in Far Harbor.	Trophies are up on PS4 for Far Harbor! Anyone else hyped? grammar, nah.
5111	But what if that bundle of cells doesn't grow up to be something that inventories identifies as a human?	Ah. Well in that reguard we have to define what exactly a human is. Its such a complicated subject and my personal belief is that as soon as cells start multiplying there is a human. Seems like a good argument to me considering when cells stop multiplying a human ceases to exist and we now have a corpse.
5112	TEACH THE CONTROVERSY!	You forgot Creationists. Yes you said religions but these people are special.
5113	No these are high info and well educated voters!	Not having any first hand information about Hillary is strongly correlated with hating her.
5114	It doesn't go with chinos	Anyone have experience with these / know how they fit?
5115	I'm pretty sure the author knew that, considering how much the narrator talked up his sick reference game.	Im pretty sure that he was (Lennon vs. Lenin), but I'm not sure if the author knew that.
5116	I probably should have mentioned, not my video.	Guy gets caught jerking it in public
5117	jagex stole this supposedly from the rsps you mentioned there, which was then stolen from a movie/novel, which was stolen from a 2000 film/1999 novel everyone steals everything	jagex is so original

5119	Just pick tiny.	Slightly derailing, but is Vyse too weak. Like vs heroes like Slark, Bristle or Axe it used to be a hard natural counter, which is why it's expensive. But with a weak vyse, slark is just cancer in pubs.

5125	Yeah, why does pandering work?	He panders hard to his fanbase and it works, for some reason.
5126	Yeah, because those Ballpark Franks are just bursting with flavor to begin with	wouldn't this suck all the flavour out of the hot dogs? once I left my hot dogs in their water too long and when i went back to eat em they were completely bland

5135	Vote trump, because if we burn it all down we can build something new, later!	No to Gary While I like Gary he truly has no chance of winning. If the country wasn't in the shape it is in right now and we weren't 19 trillion in debt along with the fact the next four years the President may get to nominate 4 potential SCJ's, I would work at a call bank for Gary. To much at stake and although the current nominees are both awful, at least Trump can get the GDP moving in the right direction and will not appoint left leaning Judges to the SC. God Bless America folks.
5136	But, but they all like the niqab and making laws that force them to remove them is against their rights!	Woman gets rid of her niqab after her village is liberated from ISIS

5138	Yes because pushing sexuality protections in ENDA under the Bush Presidency was a winner	The Clintons have only ever supported issues they think they could win. That is a criticism of them to some, it's also a selling point to some.

5140	Just remember, creepy shit is totally okay as long as the creeper is sexy	Christian Grey and Edward Cullen for portraying abuse as "romantic".

5142	And yet we all know how effective those official channels are.	There are official channels and paths to take these accusations through. Please start using these instead of posting on Reddit. No matter how airtight you believe your case to be posts like this only go onto muddy the waters of our community and in some cases bring unnecessary bad rep to the game. There are anti witch hunt rules on this site for a reason and this is another thread looking to begin one against this player. There were also rules put in place on this subreddit alone to stop cheating posts, please respect those. This game could and wants to be huge, our player numbers are climbing, our patches are improving the game and our anti cheat system is on the way. Until that time arrives we need to use and trust the systems we have in place now.
5143	It's truly shocking that a forum would host users with conflicting opinions.	LOL This sub just went from hating him to giving him respect for his game 7 performance now back to hating LOL

5146	That's a good counter point, and lord knows I'm gonna consider anything that involves me working for the Leafs!	Ehh. If it is just a personal cheat sheet I could see it. As you said, if you did actually work for the leafs I bet you could have very well printed something out like this.
5147	Well we all know its the **OLD WHITE MANS** fault that Britain left because why would they care what happens to their country if they die soon.	95% of pro-remain complaints

5150	Oh yea, we definitely want to trade places with China economically.	Great - my job was outsourced, so I make zero dollars, but those dollars are capable of buying more cheap junk from China. Poor China and their rapidly growing economy though, if only they knew how we oppress them...

5167	"Asian fit" is real.	Do some brands fit asians better? I remember many years ago when visiting japan that I noticed that stuff off the rack fit me perfectly, as the sleeves and pants didnt need to be hemmed. I wear a wide range of brands, from prada, zegna, d&amp;g, to h&amp;m and uniqlo to muji and banana republic. For work shirts mostly ike behar, nordstrom, saks and nieman marcus store brand, and lane crawford. I am not that picky on the brand but try to buy shirts with my exact arm length and not for two lengths with two buttons.

5188	Give your Aunt a high five from me	Something my 60yr+ Aunt said... Something my 60yr+ Aunt said who is child free. "Children are so much trouble... even if you want them." Funny, true and backhanded. She has said some others but none stick with me more than that one.
5189	war crimes are within the orbit of the International Criminal Court (whose authority is recognized by the US),not the ICJ, so American nationals could be sentenced for war crimes But, OTOH, the UN Security Council can prevent the Court from investigating or prosecuting a case	Good for them that they don't acknowledge the International Court of Justice otherwise they'd get into trouble for killing a bazillion people.

5193	Those look inspired by the Air Force's prototype XB-70	"a few days" It's been 40 **YEARS**. The Discovery is clearly based off the Ralph McQuarrie concept from the 1970s. Didn't like it then. Still don't.
5194	Who the hell do you think I am?	What are your favorite male characters? **Note: You pick how many characters you want to put. It's optional if you want to talk about them or no.** - Here is my list(not in a specific order): **- Lelouch vi Britannia(Code Geass):** I really liked how smart and intelligent Lelouch is. His entire plan of changing the world and all the situations he have been put in it where he had to solve it quickly, just proves his geass is not the only thing that shines on him. **-L (Death Note):** L is a great if not the greatest detective. He is very smart, intelligent and very funny. I love how he interacts with light and misa, principally how she constantly calls him a pervert XD **- Ken Kaneki(Tokyo Ghoul):** the tragic hero with a tragic life. Ken kaneki is one of the most tragic characters i have see. A semi-ghoul that not only he have to sacrifice his humanity sometimes for survive and eat meat but he have to grow emotionally and mentally to support the countless pressions of the new world which he lives in. A world where the strongest survive. Ken manages to be one of the best characters (in the manga, he is much more developed) and have a lot of badass moments where he shows he is not just a cry baby. **- Luffy(One piece):** when i first watched one piece, i loved how dumb, funny yet good hearted luffy managed to be. He is not just "friendship" power abuse like many characters. He is very courageous and kind at some point. Even if he is not really smart, he actually cares about his friends and family. **- Okabe, Rintarou(Steins;Gate):** "EL PSY CONGROO!" Steins;Gate is probably one of the best anime i have see. Okabe is really a funny character but also a good example of chunnibiyou. Though he likes to joke sometimes, he shows how much he cares about Christina, mayuri and the rest of his lab members aswell. **- Saitama(One Punch Man):** I love Saitama. He is really a funny character, principally with his poker like face sometimes in certain situations. Also, he is a good example that with hard work, you can overcome your limits but is not good to exagerate, otherwise, once you end doing a high five with someone, that person's hand might go away flying. **- Kyon(Suzumiya Haruhi series):** He is very different from many main male characters so that's why i somehow grow attached to him. He always have a boring like attitude but of course he cares about the rest of the group such as Suzumiya, Asahina, Nagato etc. He may seems a bit controversial because of a certain scene in the second season of the series but his character trully shines on the movie. He can be quite kind hearted even though he sometimes looks a bit way too serious. **- Sora(no game no life):** i really like intelligent and smart characters. Sora is a good example though. I love his perverted, funny but intelligent personality. **- Roy Mustang(Fullmetal Alchemist):** Determined, strong personality, caring and also funny. Mustang is probably one of the most badass characters for me (principally in FMAB). I love his interaction with Riza(she is also one of my favorite female characters) and how he is willed to change the world and also protect her.

5200	Some people don't give a shit/don't know anything and end up with the "point a to point b" mentality.	Does the rest of the world have something against powerful engines? Do people actually enjoy driving in subcompacts with a 1.0L engine?

5203	I agree that it's a side issue &amp; detracts from discussion, but it's not whataboutism IMO.	the user completely changes the discussion, from the actual event to "look they were detained in glorious Russia" "And in Ukraine when these events happen no one is detained because Ukraine is shit hole" Why not talk about the reasons and implications of the event instead of pointing to a case instance in Ukraine? I thought this was about Russia. I didn't know everything was a comparison between Ukraine and Russia who is better etc... but I guess that is was this subreddit devolved to. Stupid comparisons.
5204	I thought you were going to say you could pleasure women with your prehensile nose.	Who needs women if you can scratch your chin with your nose, though? Think of all the other... things... you could do with it, as well.
5205	Then they are cocksuckers and she should have fought it.	You don't get reimbursed. My mother was robbed outside a bank of america ATM, the entire incident was visible on camera, and BOA was like "lol sorry that happened, sucks bro" and didn't do anything else.
5206	It was at the bottom of the hill well before that, and now it's burrowing into the ground.	Game theory has really gone downhill in the past year or so. I still enjoy it but it used to be much better.

5223	What makes you think drugs aren't involved	This totally ruined my 'backup plan' I just always thought "I'm a pretty good looking guy, above average dick, I could get into porn." There's no way I could do that stuff without drugs, I can't believe those guys have that kind of control over their dicks.

5226	No, it's a complete shoot.	Is the CWC scripted? I imagine that since its WWE that it would be, but they're setting time limits on the bracket matches so surely that indicates some form of realism? I would actually really enjoy the actual art of Wrestling on the network since they have so many talented guys that can actually wrestle

5241	Fuck that was spot on.	the current social meta is all about validation and confirmation. what you do doesn't matter, how many people see you doing it is what matters. your accomplishments, heartbreaks, hobbies, and dreams all mean nothing unless they're on reddit, twitter, facebook, tumblr, youtube, snapchat, and everyone knows all about it. without those gleaming, glittering upvotes and comments and likes and subs, you might as well not even do anything. what good is being a sexy, trend-defying, hardcover-clutching intellectual if nobody on the internet can see and then comment and approve?

5248	Yeah because women don't need sex.	Is marriage a form of prostitution?

5259	And a much, much more acceptable excuse than the truth: gay panic.	Um, he called saying he was doing it for ISIS. That's a pretty strong ideological connection, with or without an actual personal or physical connection.
5260	Besides that, if you can get someone who studied in 'Universidad Nacional' they tend to be the best dentists around.	If you need dental work done and are a foreigner in Colombia do it here before you go back! Root canal quote from dentist it the US: $2100. They did it for $70 here. Very professional and friendly and spend a lot more time with you than in the US. Other stuff that I needed was done very cheap too.

I don't know if I was ever a full on Trump supporter, but when he and Clinton both got the nomination for their respective parties, I was actually leaning more toward Trump. However, his denial of climate change completely changed my mind. I'm not one to get caught up in the doom and gloom of many articles about the climate changing, but there is absolutely ZERO reason not to invest time, money, and energy into renewable/cleaner power sources. Especially now, when there has been so much research done and everything is so much less expensive than it was even 10-15 years ago.

5272	Well, I often joke with my brother who both has celiac and lactose intolerance that he is a picky eater, even though I'm a vegetarian.	Ugh. I'm a "picky eater" and an "inconvenience" General ranting here guys. skip this post if that stuff bores you, but i dont have many ppl to chat with about this. I just visited my family (in another state) and had to endure meal time with them. They can't seem to comprehend I don't eat meat anymore... I must have been offered meat 3 times a day. Politely declined of course: I didn't push my diet onto anyone or make a big to-do. One of these meals involved meeting with my sister (who also lives off on her own). She's known to be quite bitchy, and when I asked what she'd like for dinner she responded with "I don't care, YOU'RE the picky eater". Damn, okay. Didn't think preventing the murder of innocent animals was "picky" The next day I was venting to my friend about that night and he responded with, "well were you being an inconvenience?" THAFUQ??? imo, ethical dietary choices should be respected just as much as required dietary choices. You wouldn't call someone who has Celiac's a picky eater and tell them their diet is an inconvenience. SMDH. we got a long way to go with the rest of the world guys.

5285	They should stop expecting handouts and get a job	House Republican proposal would make it harder for poor schools to feed their students
5286	That's so generous of them.	Seven of the world's biggest banks have agreed to pay $324 million to settle a private U.S. lawsuit accusing them of rigging an interest rate benchmark used in the $553 trillion derivatives market
5287	That would be great, especially because the environment looks heavily irradiated.	That was my favourite bit of new kit from the whole trailer! I wonder if it could be an armoured radiation suit or something along those lines? It has a bit of a Master Chief/Biker Scout vibe :)
5288	tell me about it	Its bullshit you dont get anything for that.
5289	I will never hate an episode of anime as much as I hated the final episode of Tokyo Ghoul.	What anime made you the angriest? Self-explanatory. What anime made you rage the hardest? Which specific scenes?
5290	"I swear to god man, when the touch comes out, like, soon, it's gonna be awesome man, like I promise, it's gonna be better than the Vive, hold your breath it's gonna come out!"	I always find it funny when people say that it's not fair to compare the Vive with controllers to the Rift without controllers. I never got that. Because it's pretty much Product A vs. Product B and not Product A vs. Product B with additional stuff you can buy sometime in the future.
5291	Fanboys as far as the eye can see.	At least destiny were fun to play, this is not even that
5292	Maybe...	...Did she get poop on your dick?
5293	Evolve did the same thing and was a smashing success!	Imo its a great way to promote the game to the competitive eSports community. But yes, cups with price money in closed beta seem like a joke. Also it was a NA+EU cup, so players most certainly had to play with a +100ms ping, which is way above the limit for smooth gameplay.

5295	You're definitely lying since all rich people are evil conservatives.	My mother's father is actually legitimately rich and I feel the same way. He goes out of his way to help people, he has his own scholarships, etc. Whenever I visit, even though I'm a classically trained chef, he doesn't let me cook and has me sit on the deck to enjoy a beer while he grills for everyone. I see some of that same mentality in Trump that I do with my grandfather, I guess that's why I was drawn to him so quickly. Trump just seems like a genuine person.

It's equally as bad as the bitter sexists who hate korea, just the other end of the annoying spectrum. I can't even go to Itaewon or Myeongdong because of the fuckton of annoying foreigners there.
5303	Football is known for opposites fans fighting eachother in some occasions.	Wait, there are situations where you would understand somebody gets beaten up for yelling "Demacia"? And what makes a football game one of those situations?

5307	its definitly your teammates and dynamicq who are holding you back right?	I...actually pull this pretty easily in silver
5308	But bro, you used the same character as Moss, so it's totally stolen.	...silhouette art has been around since the 17th century. I'm an artist so yes, of course I'm familiar with Olly Moss. This is my own drawing and is hand sketched. It's not "copied" or "lifted." In fact it looks nothing like Moss' work except for the fact that I used a silhouette and made the desert skiff his visor.
5309	Well something must have happened before the video starts that shows the cammer pissed off the other driver...... So, cammers fault.	Well I imagine the video ends there because the camera stopped working at that point, I don't know what more you would expect him to post.

5315	If he's not shaped like a gorilla smuggling pit bulls in his jacket, how are we supposed to see him way down there in the ring?	I'll have to read the book but I hope he said more about nunzio than he's too small. The guy could work. Sure he was small but he could wrestle.
5316	Because everyone knows that having 16 opponents is easier than 1 opponent	I still wonder how things would have been if there hadn't been 18 people running. If Trump had only one or two people to debate, that were 100% focused on him versus taking down others (IE Christie attacking Rubio on being robotic), etc., I'm not so sure he would have done so well...Obviously, that's pure speculation and it would largely depend on who the other candidates were but dividing the "never Trump" more than likely helped him.
5317	You should support the more open platform.	This whole exclusivity business is the only thing keeping me from preordering/buying any VR solution. In a niche market that still needs to get traction, it's beyond stupidto lock half of the user base away from things that would make the platform grow as a whole.

5323	It's better to be sovereignly fucked over rather than get funding from undemocratic socialists.	its does redistribute some wealth from the richest to the poorest, hence the investment in the poorest areas of the UK. The point being made is whether a UK tory government would distribute money to a non-tory voting area or group. they haven't shown any inclination to date, hence the triple lock for pensions &amp; the impact of the cuts on the young and poor. would you trust a bojo/gove government to do this?

5338	you are correct, stage 1 is just a tune	I'll look into Stage 1 after I've gotten used to the current tune, Stage 1 is just a tune right? Ordered Shift Stop, thanks!
5339	I never switch characters ingame, I like sticking with one through out a game.	His rate of fire is terrible without the upgrades as he only does 60 damage up close. It takes two seconds to get another shot off, so on a high health character, it would take 4 shots to kill with full health which means the other player has to be bad enough to miss you for 8 seconds! That is quite doubtful but you may have switched characters at the end as well, who really knows. It was either that or the other team was complete trash mixed with you being a good player!

5347	Fuga's Wild Ride.... to hell with that place	What Chapter Did You Struggle with the Most in Fire Emblem: Fates? **No; I'm not talking about popular opinion. I mean from your personal experience, which chapter was the most difficult for you? In which chapter did you fail the most? What made the chapter difficult for you, and did beating that chapter improve your strategy overall?** __________________ For me, I had the most difficulty with Conquest Chapter 22. I don't turtle, but I definitely play slower that a lot of "good" players. This chapter did not let me play slowly. Freeze staves and enemy reinforcements left me sandwiched and overwhelmed; none of my units were strong enough to handle the onslaught. The only way I could win was to play quickly. I had to rush through the fort as fast as possible while keeping all my units safe so that I could get to the end safely before the reinforcements flanked me. After that chapter, I became much better at assaults and faster play. It taught me many important lessons that allowed me to breeze through Chapters 23 and 24. What about you guys? Please leave your experiences and opinions!

5356	You really aren't paying attention or reading between the lines then if you think it's been going exactly the same as 2008	The 2016 election has been going exactly how the 2008 election went. The second place candidate won New Hampshire. Clinton assumed an early lead thanks to sweeping the south, as Obama did. Clinton won thanks to a coalition of non-white voters, as Obama did. The primary is going down to the last day with the second place candidate winning the majority of the last primaries, just like in 2008.

5366	So do you own a company that sells these lights or do you like receive certain royalist from companies that do sell them?	Not originally, neon was around decades before. There wasn't any "shock-resistant" neon, and they ran on big transformers. In 1985, there were no LED's except for little weak, green, yellow, red. It was lame back then. My first prototypes were actually florescent tubes. Set in shock mounts and water-proof tubes. Neon tubes became the marketed predecessor when we got the tubes and durability to make a good product.
5367	But this is the internet, you're supposed to argue!	Where did I say he wasn't? I explicitly expanded on how they support terrorism. It just so occurs that they also *get away* with it (at least if you'd ask many of the West).

Everytime a circlejerk about paying crazy high rent in NYC comes around, a ton of people from the SF bay area try one-up everyone. Well ha! You're paying less than people pay in North Dakota per sqft. You're not nearly as big of suckers as you thought you were!

5383	Serious question: will brexit cause London to shrink again (finance sector moving out) ?	London's population first began decreasing during World War 2 due to evacuations caused by German bombings. Prior to this, London had been constructed haphazardly because of rapid industrialization. The destruction caused by World War 2 gave planners an opportunity to rebuild and resettle the population to create far better conditions. As a part of the New Towns movement and the Abercrombie Plan, among a few other things, the population of London gradually decreased as people resettled. London in the 70s experienced declining industry and rising unemployment, which contributed to the dip measured in 1981. It's been growing since then due to becoming an important financial center and foreign immigrants have been especially attracted to London.

5385	I'm 100% for limiting healing in decks but only if there is also a limit on the damage you can put in a deck	can you limit the amount of healing in a deck? its very cancerous ok so you have raptor against the ropes. you already burned all your dmg. you cant gold grief them since there is little to no gold need on these sustain decks. them out of the blue he plays 2 culinaromancers and 2 count draynor and boom 30 hp again. there is no way that agro decks survive this shit. is unfair to play an awesome game and lose because some jerk has easy 60+ hp on cards. the only choice for me is to play a grief linza every time because thats the only way to beat these pussies or should i invest a lot of money to buy a lady zay and play a lazy deck too? because super sustain play is easy as fuck i already did it and i decided that that was lame and easy quick win
5386	So the game starts faster and people don't wait to the last freaking second to do something for no freaking reason.	With Remake, can we get rid of locking in picks and bans? As nearly as I can tell, the main argument for having to lock in picks is as one more afk check. But now if you afk at the start of the game, you get punished by remake, right? Is there another reason why the required lock is good that I'm missing?

5388	I can not even look at food before 10.00am.	It's so strange, you're probably the first story I've heard of someone else who doesn't enjoy breakfast. People act like it's alien, and I've been openly mocked just about every time. I have IBS, but they never give up forcing food on me I know I don't like in the morning. Vacationing I've always had to pack and plan my own food because people are such asses about it. No one has even compromised on lunch at 11. But, your entire vacation got steamrolled! Hopefully they don't act like that to you normally.
5389	No, it just allows more of them to be deactivated - that's a subtle but important difference.	Go for ent version of win 10 it doesn't have these privacy concerns.
5390	I heard that Attack/Defense is working properly.	Anyone heard of a fix for the unplayable Casual Servers? This isn't a rant: the game is physically unplayable for me at the moment. I've tried pretty much all the gamemodes (Excluding CP; didn't have time to test) are having the issue where the "Prepare to Compete" stage isn't ending. Granted, the DM's that result are kinda fun, but to be honest I miss the old game and actually being able to play. Has anyone heard of, or is at least aware of any form of fix heading in for this? Sorry for the millionth complaint about this update, but someone's gotta have heard something because this (And a lot of other things, but specifically this right now) is critically game-breaking and requires developer attention. TLDR: Casual isn't starting resulting in permanent and unending DM. Anyone heard of a fix?
5391	Before I go further: are you pro- or anti- theory?	No idea how to develop my skills at this point. Please help! Hi everyone! I've been "playing guitar" on and off for roughly 17 years. Quite honestly, my skills peaked about two years in and I've never been able to improve. Chords and movement speed are great. But as for coordination and developing other styles (bluegrass etc) I've made absolutely no progress. Are there songs or artists that you have used, even if you don't like their music, to improve your skills? I'm trying to get better at finger picking, coordination, the whole nine yards. Any advice or direction would be extremely helpful. Thanks!

5393	You could take all the fans out, wont make much noise anymore	Why is my PC still loud? So I originally built my PC with budget parts and it was pretty loud. So I invested in better case fans and CPU coolers and a better power supply. All these and I still get the same exact kind of sound! Here's the specific parts I used: EVGA Supernova 550GS Power Supply Cooler Master GeminiiM4 CPU Cooler EVGA GeForce GT640 Graphics Card Cooler Master 120mm fans Any way to get my computer quiet? Because it's been making the same kind of noise since I even built it with the original parts.

5399	i love throwaways not	OMG. A few years ago I hooked up with this girl who worked at my local pharmacy. She was smoking hot, petite, with a gorgeous smile. She also had a deformed arm. Not quite a T-Rex arm as you've described but a very slender arm ending in a couple of very tiny nubs where her fingers would have been. I got to know her and then asked her out and we went on a couple of dates. She was moving overseas so she didn't want anything serious and I was fine with that. The sex was....awesome. Just pure animalistic rutting. Like two monkeys fucking for their species, we did it everywhere. One weekend I was chilling at her house and we got a little drunk and high. Then we started getting down with the nastiness and she asked me if she could play with my butt. I was fine with butt play and off she went. She was amazing. Doing all kind of funky things like milking my prostate and such. I never knew I'd really get into that sort of thing but it was great. Then she said "I'm going to try something, baby. Just relax..." That's when I felt something bigger than a few fingers getting stuffed into my bunghole. It was girthier but it felt pretty neat so I closed my eyes and relaxed as she did her magic. Then I heard her say "this is so cool..." and I looked down. She'd inserted her deformed arm (nubby little mong-fingers and everything) inside me up to about halfway up her forearm. To cut a long story short, that's how we both discovered a certain fetish. She moved away a few months later but it was fun while it lasted. **TL;DR Got turned into a ventriloquist doll by a cute girl with a deformed arm.**

5444	There is talent all across the Ex-YU Area but there is nobody who is willing to organise and sponsor a big team.	There's talent in Bosnia, that's for sure. But let's see how HuNter preforms in the latter stages of the qualifier against more meaty opponents.
5445	DON'T FUCKING TELL ME WHAT TO DO SHITLORD	"Feminism has nothing to do with cheating" "Feminists don't cheat as much as 'traditional' women" Pick one.
5446	Where are the prostitutes when you need them?	Concepisce un figlio con l'amante mentre anche la moglie aspetta un figlio. A dispetto del titolo, la parte in cui illude l'amante di essere single mi pare la meno rilevante per stabilire che trattasi di un cretino irresponsabile.
5447	Right	Ah, bid week. Your pick?
5448	Use a sarcasm tag then	Bro *that was the joke*
5449	Not unless you either work for NBC or go to Rio.	Any link to the match in question?
5450	I'm sure THIS will end in an indictment!	U.S. House panel: FBI provides documents on Clinton email probe
5451	You sure about that, this could be part of Spalletti's radical new strikerless formation that literally leaves the striker on the bench.	I'm quite sure Roma will play with 11 men.
5452	Didn't god use to want her to be pres according to her	Michele Bachmann Says "God Raised Up" Trump To be GOP Presidential Nominee
5453	Yeah I just had read the description and it made it sound like he just lied to his mom and it got blown out of proportion without his doing but he had been spreading the story on his own.	I get that, I was just curious why he told the lie in the first place.
5454	well this game is basically minecraft + dayz	I got triggered at your name.
5455	What a right wing rag	Clinton Foundation Scrutinized After Emails | Morning Joe | MSNBC
5456	Their opinion is valid because they're women, but wrong because they're probably not thinking clearly due to the patriarchy pressuring and brainwashing them.	So what would they say about pro-life women then? They are out there. They're women, so is their opinion valid, or only when they agree with you.
5457	This must be why women love dick pics so much.	Sorry that this little experiment was conducted in the worst possible way. A gay guy is not going to be hard for them. When a woman sees an erect penis typically her brain sees that and she becomes horn herself a little bit.
5458	Someone should have done some more research, because spoilers, [this is not where he actually dies...]	I can't be the only one...
5459	Faster Than Light.	Yes it is actually. They have released 6 patches full with troubleshooting to fight crashes in 2 weeks. How much faster do you really want them to work?

5464	no you hate all music you joyless pleb	I'm not. I know Weezer. I don't care for them but I have no issue with them. But, I definitely don't know the members names. It has nothing to do with not liking music.
5465	Break up with her	What would you think if your BF told you he lost his virginity to a prostitute?
5466	I definitely agree, it feels like a really long slog to get a ship I want.	So much grind I haven't seen much discussion about the rate of XP gain. I've talked to a few people in match who seem to think it's rather grindy, and seen a few posts similar in tone. I played the game quite a lot pre-wipe, and had all (or most) of the ships unlocked. I miss the diversity, and don't feel like i'm gaining xp at a reasonable rate. I gain 1-2k in a match with no players with the paid XP bonux. I gain 2.5-4k in a match with a few paid players, which is not uncommon. tl;dr i miss my ships and feel like the rate of ship acquisition is very slow compared to pre-wipe.
5467	I hate ota reports but wake up every morning reading them.	Going to go watch some games from last season that I didn't see. Also re-watch most if not all of our games to go over the strengths/weaknesses of the team. Would also like to watch some NFL documentaries and maybe read some books. Get too bored if you don't do anything. Small reports from OTAs can only satisfy you so much.
5468	Nah, you just got outplayed, mate.	Cheater or Lag?
5469	technically i did not - the fact that people have to be stupid to believe the notion in questions verifies the fact that people are stupid.	Dehumanizing out-groups is a common feature of primitive human psychology. You employed it a bit yourself in your own comment.

5471	Remember that in this alternative Kaoh Rong universe, Tai never backstabbed his alliance	Scot and Jason would have voted her out. They would have taken Tai to the end since he would be easier to beat.
5472	I guess they teach it at the "richcarowners" class before you buying one	You don't park your $2M+ car next to any high curbs.
5473	They changed it so it's a random 15 second buff, (a rare one at that) along with adding a toy one into the game	wait they turned it into a toy? *looks it up* this is a newer development than i knew about
5474	Nonsense im with @Boshasaurus_Rex walls never have and never will serve a purpose.	you dont need to patrol a wall as much as open ground because the wall is a deterrent. i think motion detectors on a wall negates ropes n ladders. tunneling would always be an issue, but a wall is just a deterrent. more agents available for coastline = more agents to search for stowaways, i guess.
5475	Anything that doesn't agree with my opinion is irrelevant.	PSA: Downvote buttons are there to downvote irrelevant comments, not because you dislike it. Its not a dislike button for fuck's sake. Stupid hivemind. This is why this subreddit is a shithole.
5476	Yes because your political stance has everything to do with your skepticism of refugees.	Liberals would be
5477	no, it's that they're savvy with abuse and know that anyone even hinting they might be wrong is gaslighting	As always, they have no fucking clue and it doesn't matter how many times we tell them it isn't like they think it is
5478	Nice I get a month of Civ before playing Pokemon.	CIVILIZATION VI Official Announcement Trailer
5479	The real question is Red Dead Redemption 1 on pc	Ok I cant hold in Ubi's info. Here you go, the time is 4:35est so Im not bullshitting. JUST DANCE, then GRWL, THEN SOUTHPARK, THEN DIVISION THEN EAGLE FLIGHT THEN STAR TREK THEN FOR HONOR THEN GROW UP THEN TRAILS THEN AC MOVIE THEN WATCH DOGS 2 THEN NEW GAME THEN ANOTHER NEW GAME
5480	More than once, there are some big things going down, for instance, [lol not spoiling]	youll be in heaven within 30 mins in.
5481	Yes, he was forced to make those statements.	Yes, much of the corporate-owned politicians and media in this country are enemies of the people. Taking them down a peg is the first step to getting people to see their true incompetence.
5482	Because the stories we tell have nothing to do with the way we view the world!	What is worse is the fact that liberals and the alternative right will use the it's just a movie excuse.
5483	You'd prefer it were Saul?	I wouldn't
5484	My guess is he was doing some music recording and forgot to turn the reverb off on his rig.	Is Hank's voice reeeally echoey for anyone else?
5485	Nope :P	Haste... six creatures, with one non-creature that generates mana... I'm going with [[Ruric Thar, the Unbowed]].
5486	Found the guy who works for gw	Or maybe, they got feedback asking for higher volume of paint in the wash pots, and their racks in all their stores only fit a certain size. They didn't want their vendors to have to change displays or waste money replacing or producing new racks, so instead made the pot taller. It's easy to bash on GW, but they aren't always out to destroy your life. They make good products. Expensive ones, yes. But they've been around for a long time and there is a reason.
5487	I think it was a fantastic sams actually.	Did you ask for the classic fuckboi cut at great clips?
5488	And all actions which could ever be perceived as insulting by anyone should be illegal and fined by the Government.	If you refuse to shake someone's hand. Is that not considered an insult? If the reason you refuse to shake that person's hand is because she's a woman is that not more of an insult?
5489	How about a line showing how the ball is going to bounce, too?^^^	Suggestion: Show arrows for team mates around your screen Too often now I've been playing a 2v2 or 3v3, and just after kick off when you're re-positioning your self or you are flying through the air trying to air shot you end up running into your team mates totally knocking them off course for that goal scoring shot or an epic save... We already have an arrow on screen when the ball is out of view... Can we get the same for team mates too?
5490	Wow I hate you	Is well within my right to recline my fucking seat on a plane. That sweet sweet recline.

I miss ut2004, my brother was one of the best instagib ctf players who played in all the clan wars and stuff, meanwhile I was one of the most knowledgeable onslaught players (knew most maps' tricks), and since we played on the same account, it was fun to get people to think we were just one godlike player

5506	Better to be thought an idiot than to vote and remove all doubt.	"except for me lol!"
5507	Not being part of a superstate is clearly why New York can't be a major financial centre	Britain has a lot of economic power. But its all from a "services economy" the thing about services is that they're ethereal. A sevices company isnt tied down to a physical place. The only thing stopping them upping stakes is the difficulty of hiring new people, and thats not insurmountable like moving a factory is. If britain doesnt get a trade deal (and frankly even if it does, amongst industries there will be winners and losers) then these companies will find it more attractive to relocate to europe and sell to britain.

5511	Listen to us Germany, you are being ruled by sharia law, the only way to change that is to elect BERNIE SANDERS!	But but Americans telling me I live in a country ruled by sharia.
5512	This school is getting soft, we need Donald Trump to step in to make it great again	Okay, what happened this time? Anyone else notice that whenever something political or controversial (for example, that reactionary neoconservative guy speaking here earlier in the month. Which I won't go into further because everyone has their opinions and I'm not here to start arguments) happens on campus we all get a vague, noncommittal statement from President Barchi emailed to us that could be about literally anything? Got one about "Rutgers encouraging free speech" in my inbox today, it answers no questions and leaves no clue as to what it's talking about. So what controversial thing happened this time? Maybe they're sending it out "just because" but that hasn't seemed to be the case in the past. This school is weird as hell.
5513	You cant write on federal currency that's illegal	To get thru the next couple days :))
5514	That source is trustworthy though	Trump supporter charged with voting twice in Iowa says 'polls are rigged' - As a Trump supporter. I say good thing they caught her. Because fraud is wrong regardless of who commits it. We're better than that. Let this be a clean election!

5523	2 Epic Carnival pulls would likely do better for you, with the Epic Carnival you're always guaranteed to pull at least 1 Epic medal and sometimes you can be guaranteed one of the new medals.	Is it likely that this epic carnival will give better results than the royal deal? Im new/at quest 190 and just started fhe coliseum.

5542	Johnson is pro-choice?	I can't vote pro-choice either.
5543	I believe they call it entitlement.	I think it's due to people not wanting to work for their rewards.
5544	I personally think they should take a leaf out of Blizzard's vac system!	Valve will never create a system where you can lose cosmetics. A lot less will pay for them when they know it can be lost with a rage tantrum.
5545	What, you mean you've never heard of 1984, aka 19th century Nostradamus.	It appears that Reddit always recommends the same books in every book related thread. I'm having a hard time finding new stuff to read and all the Reddit threads that I have looked up seem to recommend the same books again and again. Now, I like Harry Potter, Kurt Vonnegut, Catch-22, Hitchhiker's guide, all the books that were assigned in school and such. But it feels like Redditors are all out of ideas when it comes to suggesting new books. What are your favorite books that aren't usually suggested on Reddit.
5546	A Fiio E10k is always a good DAC for Headphones around that Pricerange bec it has pretty much no competiton at this Pricepoint	But would it be worth getting an Astro Mixamp or any other external or internal sound card?

5548	Bingo hit the head on the bullet there bud	Game came out in 2010, it's now six years later, around here elementary is 1-6, junior high is 7-8, four years of high school. Based on these calculations, you're either a going into your junior or sophomore year of college. Fuck you and your youth. And holy fuck i've been wearing this for six years?
5549	Man, those shitty regulations not letting the free market leave people to die if they can't pay.	I work in health care. You can make up any shit you want about the goodness of public intervention and regulation, doesn't matter, the reality is it is not a true market system. A hospital can't refuse service if you can't pay (for example). I think single payor systems are proven fucked in every country that has them but that wasn't my point. My point is that you can't use healthcare as evidence of a failure of a market system when you constrain it so much it can't work like a market system
5550	but muh tax dollars	There would be much less drama if they just admitted the fact that they want to be dicks towards fat people, rather than "caring about their health". Who are they trying to fool?
5551	So it's an extremely low resolution camera	Correct! They are not the same thing. Have an upvote A camera is a device that contains an array of photosensors.. among other mechanics.

5553	Honestly an amd a10 7870k will have a better gpu and cpu than that.	I really don't know. It's running an old core2 quad and a 9800gtx..and it just doesn't like it, at least 2+ players on one screen. It's not that it can't run it just that it feels laggy ya know? RL is one of those games that has to run perfectly or just isn't fun to play.
5554	Death threats from Xbox Live children - Something to take serious.	It might start something worse, never share their tags, do you want some crazy people to start sending them death threats?
5555	It certainly has been an interesting year all around.	I heard someone say this after Brexit but I think it still applies. "The season finale of 2016 is going to be crazy!!"
5556	The more important questions: is there a difference, and does it matter to them?	I can never tell if it's pro-TEST or anti-TEST propaganda.
5557	How did you go about inducing lactation?	Well I actually don't do anything on cam, but I do that sort of thing anyway in my own free time. It's kind of the whole reason why I induced lactation in the first place. Not gargling specifically, I just enjoy playing with it in general.
5558	Editorial layout, logo design, print design, spending the day in Adobe CC, QuarkXpress and similar.	What do you use your mac for? As title says. Anything cool that you do that others may not, any good uses, literally anything. I've had a mac for a while but I never get any practical use out of it. I also have an iPhone and Apple watch, so any connectivity or cool apps are also welcomed.
5559	It's Mother Natures Labia Minora.	This wave
5560	If there is added sugar it's usually in the ingredients	0% fat sorry I should change that in the text. I've heard the argument that some people don't really trust a 0% fat dairy product because there's a tendency for manufacturers to fill the flavor gap with sugar and I see the point there. I haven't actually tried fat-present greek yogurt so I might do that but I do like the non-fat. I've made sure that I select the one with the least amount of sugar.
5561	We have condoms for STDs.	I got circumcised last Sept. for recurring infections, but I do really like the aesthetics and cleanliness/lack of odor. It also makes you resistant to some STDs which is cool too. I had a local anesthetic. The first shot stung like hell for 15-20 sec. then there was no more pain. You can still feel pressure and temperature tho. It was painful for a few days but I had pills for that. After that its kind of sore when you need to move it or pull it out to pee but not bad. The stitches feel weird and itch. If you go to a doc who does this all the time, (where I went they do 8 circumcision in a day) it's not risky, but regular urologist only do it occassionally and probably only do the procedure they learned in school.

5579	Yeah, they should call him SLANDERS, right?	I've only had one email someone linked me that was actually anti-Sanders. Most of this anti-Sanders stuff discussed in this thread is DNC people discussing how to defend themselves against Sanders (often baseless) accusations.

5581	they included innovation fee in ride... :D	Anyone knows what step they took to "virtually legalize" uber?
5582	You should report that right away, mine is working GREAT	My radar never goes below 3 steps? When I first got the game the radar would show the pokemon as 1, 2, or 3 steps away. Now, for the past couple weeks the app displays all pokemon as 3 steps, no matter how close or far away they are. Pokemon that are shownas 3 steps away will appear right in front of me. This is a massive glitch as I am unable to find pokemon... Just blindly walk around and hope they appear. I cant figure out what direction to walk in at all, which is really frustrating when there is all these rare pokemon on my radar. The game was working fine when I first got it, what gives?
5583	I hope he does so much, icardi looks like the perfect poacher type that would thrive with the amount of chances we create, not that keen on Lacazette tho	Because a lot of people on this sub still think Wenger will sign a decent striker.
5584	you forgot this	Not sure what every IWD fanboy is flaming Hash for when all his points are 99% accurate
5585	That's how it was before it got changed a few months ago, and it was very annoying because it's fast move speed and big blast radius it could just rush people and even if those people destroyed it, by the time they did it was already close enough to kill them.	I feel like the tire should explode normally when it gets shot down, so you still have a chance if the enemy wasn't smart enough to back up.

YOU DON'T JUST WALK UP ON SOMEONE AND SLAP THE SHIT OUT OF THEM WHEN THEY'RE SLEEPING!!! I COULD'VE FUCKING KILLED YOU! Carl: God *damn* that's some fucking bullshit. Are you fucking serious?? How would you like it if I did that shit to you? Fuck outta here! Frank: You ain't gonna do shit. Calm down. Carl: God *damn* it. There's no *way* I'm going back to sleep now. Frank: Tough shit. Have a drink. Carl: FUCK!
5602	Good performance and the ability to edit files locally instead of through some shitty web interface.	What are some things that website builders (Wix, squarespace, etc) Can't do and probably won't be able to do in the next few years?
5603	See, smoke wouldn't be useless if we could standardise it across setting.the problem is your average player has no idea how to use it.	* Turn off flora entirely so everyone can see through cover (or not since it's the same for all) * Turn off smoke because it's useless anyway and stops friendlies from shooting the enemy * Balance shaders to lowest setting so it's the same for every one
5604	You mean besides all those people the Clintons are having murdered?	The biggest surprise of this campaign would be if we make it through the end of the year without a politically motivated murder. Still 90+ days away and I doubt things will cool down as we get closer to November.
5605	Harambe 2016	How about just elect a **third party?** That'll guarantee a revote.
5606	Sarcasm oftentimes doesn't translate well over text.	I am going to keep letting you think I am dumb and see how far this conversation gets us. So is this like a bad thing? Totally wasnt being sarcastic earlier or anything. Please tell me all about how you know so much more than me on this subject in which Ive reported on for half a decade.

5614	And Orange Box ads everywhere	Someone didn't play 1.6 back when they added fucking ingame billboard ads.
5615	Glad you appreciate one of the single most main and overarching storyline in the entire series.	Well, for me Dany's story is the most unnecessary to the whole thing. I don't mind some magic but "the girl coming from nowhere being in power because she has dragons" is way more stupid (and kinda boring) than the magic Bran is surrounded by.

My son also has eczema and was prescribed medication for it. My MIL likes to remind me on a weekly basis that the steroids in his topical cream will stunt his growth, make his skin thin and cause his reproductive development to be delayed. But she's also believes my son isn't lactose intolerant, he's allergic to the bovine molecule. Whatever the fuck that means.

5631	Honestly, it certainly helped that my teacher was extremely passionate about biology and genuinely enjoyed it, so she would go into quite a bit of detail (at least as much detail as time and the shitty curriculum would allow)	In the biology class here, we first went through a bit of chemistry and then to the structure of the cell. I'm sure we covered the ER, but if we did, it was very basic kind of stuff. Only when I took cellular biology in college did I actually learn more about stuff like the mitochondria, and how it specifically makes energy, rather than "hurr durr powerhouse".
5632	Yeah what a c-word, She didnt have to leave like that!	Met A Bad Guardian Today I was in a fireteam on Oryx, Hard Mode. We were exchanging banter (these were LFG people) when one random joined to replace a lost Guardian. Now, a member of our fireteam was a woman. No one cared, obviously. Just another Guardian trying to kill Oryx. Then this person, out of nowhere, begins asking her specifically how old she is, what her snapchat is, and other questions in this incredibly invasive manner that made us all uncomfortable. After a while, our fireteam leader drew the line and kicked him. A short while later, the lady left to "cool off" because she was left feeling very uncomfortable. Why do rogue Guardians (are they even deserving of the title?) like this have to ruin a game as beautiful in its social capacity as Destiny is for the other players out there? Our community is renowned for being one of the friendliest, welcoming and open gaming communities in the gaming world. I've experienced the Light from my fellow Guardians many a time. I just wish that the one little Corrupted Blight in the fireteam would keep his mouth shut and his libido in check. Basically, dont be a c-word.

5643	So stop being bad and kill them as soon as they're out of their spawn	PSA: if you're playing defense, stay by the control point. By this I mean, don't rush their spawn point. If you kill them, they'll just come back full health in 10 seconds. If you die, it'll take a minute to get back there. Not to mention, what if they flank and get to the control point? Now you have to turn your back on their spawn. It's just bad news bears.
5644	The mix of boredom and procrastination is a wonderful thing.	Right? I think this sub is more about boredom than loneliness. Like half of us are shipped anyway, and even with the single people there's a lot of folks who aren't even using OkCupid.
5645	Oh you.	I know what you mean, it's super unbearable.
5646	This is why you feed yourself off gamer fuel like Doritos and Mountain Dew.	A few months ago my friend tried to cook his hot dog using his CPU as a frying pan.
5647	But isn't everyone born in the US muthafucking A?	Are you dumb? Just bec you don't understand it doesn't mean everyone can't understand it.

5658	I think it more like you provide an environment that instills the difference in right and wrong every day.	I just don't understand it. It's like, as a parent, do you really need to tell your kid it's not ok to rape somebody? If parents need to explain that to their kids, then I'm sorry, but we as a civilization are doomed.

5666	and following it a permanent ban cause you are extremely toxic for leaving the game	u will get lp for sure
5667	Gosh, I can't believe they want them to vote	There's quite a difference between companies like Patagonia doing it because they believe it's the right thing to do, and companies like General Motors and Ford doing it because the UAW forced them to do it. Yes, they gave management the day off too, but only because there are no plants to run. On the other hand, UAW members are "encouraged" to go volunteer for the Democratic Party on election day so most of them don't really get the day off.
5668	They should nerf it to 16m	I agree, its not broken but its on the edge of broken, if they nerfed it no one would cry.

5671	It's almost as if we hold Israel, a developed democracy that we give billions of aid to each year, to a higher standard than a group that we have designated as a terrorist organization.	Israeli general says something: 3,000 comments. Some olive trees get chopped down: 5,000 comments. 13 people about to be executed: 6 comments.
5672	Dat integrity.	Don't forget foreign donations, negative campaigning and an astounding unwillingness to release tax returns that weren't from the year he was planning to run for president.

5674	If Stamkos doesn't want to share some limelight with a goalie... good luck.	I think so too, but there's also the idea that Stamkos wants to be THE GUY wherever he lands. He'd be sharing the limelight with Hall and Schneider I hope we make a good offer

5678	lore wrote to justify not putting a broken spell in the game	The reason why perfect invisibility is dangerous. The description for the spell "Hidden Body" reads that perfect invisibility is unachievable due to the risk of dissipation, and the result of achieving this state is incredibly grim in the world of Dark Souls. The reason for this and the form of "dissipation" induced by the spell "Hidden Body" in a state of perfect invisibility is much more darker than the usual greedy way of life that an invisible person might have. You see, if you were able to cast a perfected version of the spell "Hidden Body" to make your body completely invisible, that would mean that the form your own soul inherits is completely invisible, and your soul has nothing to manifest itself in. Your soul escapes you, and thus re-emergence from invisibility will leave a being devoid of an inherited soul, who hasn't even died for the soul to abandon it. In other words, a person that attains "perfect invisibility" hides their form from their own soul, causes the soul to abandon the hidden body because their form is no longer "apparent" in that sense. This is the reason too, why the spell "Hidden Weapon" doesn't put weapons at risk of anything critically endangering, because they are only objects without soul. Just some food for thought, this is some fluffy lore.
5679	They follow the winner, then have to wait for a reply before they announce.	Its been over an hour though...
5680	The problem with "made up" scandals is that at this point it's like a boy who cried wolf thing, the GOP has made up some fake stories and scandals, and now no one actually takes some of the more serious ones like they actually matter, because they just *assume* it's a right wing conspiracy.	It is almost as if her record is more important than made up scandals.
5681	I love the bandwagon flair lmao	Doesn't look likely they'll land him then.
5682	Uber.	TIFU by not bringing a backpack to class orientation Hi y'all today was class orientation and I got 4 giant books, a school laptop, planner, and my schedule. And like an idiot I forgot my backpack or any bag to carry them in. To make matters worst I biked to school about a miles way. I can't carry the load of books with one hand so I can't walk my bike back. My only solution it seemed was to balance the load on my handle whilst biking and letting the movement balance the weight so I can hold it down with one hand. Trying to get sitting on the seat while the books were on my handle was near impossible, I spent about 20 minutes having my bike fall over while I tried to get all my books on the handle. I start to get really pissed. To make matters even worse there's just some kid staring at me as I kick the shit out of my bike in frustration. I finally somehow manage to get all the stuff on my handles, whilst I hold the bike handle with my left hand and balance the load with my right. I set the bike in motion and manage to get a lot more stability. My planner slips off the pile, the first fatality. I decide to leave it or else I may risk dropping the laptop. At this point I can't stop lest I lose all my balance, I decide to got the route with the least amount of stops as to make sure I can just keep going as far as I can. I am riding alongside a busy road at this point and decide to take the sidewalk so I don't trip into a car if I crash. Big mistake. Cracks fucking everywhere. I have to use all my strength to keep the pile and bike stable. I almost fall into a 2 inch tall ditch on the side of the side walk, I see my life flash before my eyes. I manage to not fall and escape certain death. Every road intersection I cross I hope that a car doesn't come lest I be hit cause I can't stop. I realize my situation is exactly like the one in the movie Speed. Shit. I'm going really slow but it feels like 50mph every crack loosening my grip, I reach the crosswalk across the main road. For this one I have to press I button, there is one guy walking by I start yelling like a maniac "PRESS THE BUTTON!" as I come speeding by, he manages to get the button. God bless him he saved my pile's life. I finally manage to get back to my house, I realize my driveway is made of gravel, shiet. I x-games my fucking way through all the gravel, slowly performing the greatest stop in all of history. The school laptop charger decides to fall out of my pocket and get stuck in the chain, my books, I, and the laptop, are all thrown off the bike. I bear hug the laptop and fall to the ground. My books and I are super messed up but at least I managed to save my laptop. tl;dr I reenacted the movie Speed on my bike.
5683	If they can stay healthy they are the 3rd best team in the league.	Does anyone feel like the Clippers are going to be a huge problem for the league next year? I know they haven't even made the WCF with their core 4 of Redick, CP3, Blake and Deandre. CP3 is getting older but still dominates without the elite athleticism he had as a Hornet and has shown he is willing to be much more aggressive in the playoffs than in the regular season. Blake should be ready to have his best season at the age he is at. Deandre gets better every year, and even without a post game has turned into a plus on both ends of the floor. Redick is just always solid spacing the floor and playing good team D. I think if they all stay healthy and just somehow find a way to get a decent small forward(Rudy Gay?), they could seriously wreck in the postseason next year even without a deep bench.
5684	If people didn't like Hillary Clinton, they wouldn't have come out to vote for her in the entirely optional Democratic primary.	nobody likes the nominee? thats pretty dang new for an election
5685	But I like the feeling of disappointment.	If you're rich enough to get that high level, you should probably buy the hats instead of relying on a rigged slot machine to hand out untradeleable 1 cent couriers and voice packs. Or just go to a nice gambling city like Las Vegas or Monaco and waste your money there, at least you're gonna have a fun time.
5686	This must be how it's like in Australia	A due upgrade to the RX 480
5687	Depending on the state you live in vote green party to end FPTP shitty voting system.	I'll write my own name in before I vote for Trump, but I can understand the motivation. Personally, I love Bernie and he has taught me much and has inspired me more. I've decided to take my destiny into my own hands and heart and mind. If someone can lead me out of bondage they can lead me back in, I must break my own shackles and help others to break theirs.
5688	We are learning lots about people's past and how these revelations further the characters.	and that means?
5689	Someone who really values Internet points	Wtf was that
5690	No, if europe does similar things its reasonable and democratic, because we are the good guys.	In Iceland they use a chopper with heat vision against people growing cannabis in their apartments. Which is fucking overkill, ugh
5691	Well clearly you're also cis-splaining, so everything you say can be denied by anyone without consequence because you're too privileged to experience and understand anything in life.	As a man I'm triggered by the term mansplaining because it's constantly used wrong. But when I point that out I'm accused of mansplaining. Or whitesplaining.
5692	Not OP but please do	Can I steal this for a writing prompt?

5697	ME	FUCK
5698	bumping college dropout	In the white house going all out?
5699	Arent the expansions free or no?	Absolutely. And the insurgent expansion is well worth it too. The second and third expansions ain't worth it, though.
5700	...what?	I used to work at a bull stud, a place that collected and froze semen from bulls. We had a Bison bull that was kept there and collected from time to time. The collection was an epic story with which I will not bore you, but just keeping him there was pretty interesting. Our fences were oil field drill stem set in concrete with rails made of sucker rod. It would stop a locomotive. When we had a visitor we would take them out to the old Bison's pen, and they would just naturally walk up to the fence. He would just be standing out in his pen, looked asleep to the casual observer. As soon as they would get up to the fence he would take off, and I swear he would go from 0 to about 40 in nothing flat. He would hit that fence as hard as he could and make it ring like a bell. It was spectacular to watch. Made some people piss their pants.
5701	BHO or Barry seems popular too	Barack HUSSEIN Obama usually.
5702	We've become the circlejerk!	All the comments of people liking GCJ brings tears to my shill eyes :')
5703	Never played WoW as a warlock or paladin have ya?	I've started on saturday, but I've played quite a few other MMOs before so I didn't really have any problems getting started. So from my fresh experience as a "noob", there's just one thing: **How to get a damn mount?!?!** It took me way too long googling about Grand Companies and all that stuff. Matter of fact I've joined a Free Company after all to get the Chocobo license and the guys told me that it's actually tied to some Grand Company questline. It's been a while since I've last played an MMO, but I can't remember any other that locked mounts behind a series of a couple hundred quests, many hours into the game, without ever explaining how to get one. Really frustrating.
5704	summoned for 350 gems, got him 3 times xd	Lol yeah I wanted that goten too he seemed like a beast. Well congrats on the phys trunks and the str ss3 vegeta
5705	Am i alone in thinking that if that were me, i would have booted it back into the water?	Seal seeks shelter on motor boat
5706	It's frustrating because there are a ton of legit reasons to dislike him that have nothing to do with how he eats.	I'm actually kind of impressed that Trump has earned a segment off of something as silly as eating KFC with a fork and knife. How desperate the media is to find anything to bash Trump on is the true cringe.
5707	I'm going to guess Missouri.	Which state?
5708	I'm sure Russ won't take exception to this.	Draymond Green: "Russell said I did it on purpose but he's a part of the superstar group that started all this acting in the NBA.""
5709	But obviously, it did cure them, however they just simply contracted it again, so must force themselves to have sex with yet another Virgin!	You'd think after seeing that NOBODY is being cured of AIDS after having sex with virgins, they'd get a fucking clue. ^^^^It ^^^^doesn't ^^^^work.
5710	Yeah those contacts are creepy af	Oh god, the eyes. I feel them staring into my soul.
5711	The REPUBLICAN CONGRESS?	no she didnt...congress did. Nice try though.
5712	In what way did it sound wrong?	um, ok. Great he voted but many things he said sounded wrong. Anyway, Go Bernie.
5713	i really dont get how kerr didnt get one earlier he was so far out	Obvious Foul, obvious Technical since he's been talking all night long and could've got one earlier since he walked out onto the court yelling at Crawford. Deservedly mad but come on you can't expect to berate Crawford and get away with it.
5714	Apparently you've never been to a ballgame...	A bigot? I just watched an entire classroom of people riot over a One minute video clip. I am hopelessly confused. In a western country. Highly educated people. Acting like apes. Over a video. Like any rational person will laugh and walk away when you call their mother a whore. Or tell someone to fuck themselves even when you insult their country. But to -riot-? That's fuckin' confusing, man. Also, bless you.
5715	Sure, that's more likely	Or maybe they would to become martyrs and have the whole organization praise them for their faith.
5716	Your move, Bill.	Malcolm Turnbull says colonisation of Australia could be described as 'invasion'

5718	im pretty sure its just you....	Idk if it just me but I click that and get a link to a picture of a cactus
5719	THIS HAS TO BE PHOTO SHOPPED	We all know an intact white family triggers SJWs, but what about an all-American black family?
5720	It's almost as if republican shills are here to push Hillary in order to piss off Berners and galvanize support against Clinton	It is as if they do not understand what this sub is all about. I never visited their site, because I support Bernie. You are hurting your cause. Understand that you never gain points when you slander someone's candidate. I certainly have grown more adverse to your candidate since CTR and other comments made to counter my posts. Just some friendly advice.
5721	It's like the dunk contest - it gets harder every year because you have to do something no one has ever seen to get that 10/10.	How times have changed.
5722	Eh that might be your experience but certainly not mine.	spoken like a retail virign it was at least one thing when they paid you commission now they battle you over performance and the amount of hours they'll employ you
5723	Um, but she was only going one way	Fiat drives the wrong way down a one-way street
5724	Tide... Roll over... Good boy!	"Rarrr Tide"

5730	You mean steal another flag, you flagstealers!	You take that back or we'll come right over and return with a new flag after our victory.
5731	You simply re-typed the position, ignored supporting the premises and ignored answering the questions.	If something is perfect it is whole or complete. There is no need to add anything. Hence if God is perfect then he is whole or complete and does not need anything else. Nor need to create anything.

5739	That have to do more with games being online, so no one bothers to make ai good	To be fair the AI in most TCGs for online is complete utter garbage. Heck, AI in general is pretty damn terrible in any game bar some RTSes where it just min-maxes

5746	I don't think anything warrants that, but I'm not sure what that has to do with anything.	But do you think that separating someone from their family and friends should be the consequence of that practice?
5747	On the topic, now that Lesnar tested positive for roids his win over Taker at WM 30 should be declared a no contest	I wonder if his record on the course is better than his record at wrestlemania?

5749	he's awful yet his career has been good.	I blame Harold.
5750	I know maphack was pretty widely used in first w3 dota and scbw, didn't know sc2 has the same problem, thanks for explaining	People use maphack. It basically takes off the fog of war in your minimap, so you can see where they spawn and all army movement at all times + some even have a production tab which is a feature only used in spectating mode to show viewers what builds they are going for. It takes forever for blatant cheaters to get banned in starctaft and when they do they just make a new account. Nerffy is an infamous maphacker, hes been doing it for years with the same damn name lol and even streams himself hacking + shows viewers how to get the hacks.
5751	No more.	Don't hurt me.
5752	Sure you do.	Kids. You learn selflessness, accountability, and financial responsibility.
5753	It would actually be good if they said that.	Don't give them ideas, please.
5754	Sigh... Guess it's time to trade for a bunch of bargain former first round players again.	Pats 2017 first round taken confirmed.
5755	I clearly meant economic policies...	not sure if an economist would be a considered an authority on military ventues, so that is irrelevant. but strictly economical, david stockman and martin feldstein are the two biggest reagan sidekicks. and the alan greenspan, but no one likes him

5765	That's what I call "taking it standing".	Lavezzi Goal vs United States (1-0)
5766	Oh now hang on, rich people are all greedy and evil - I think there is a universal truth there we can all get behind	Ah there it is, the ol' "fat people are inherently good people" It goes right alongside my other favorites "poor people are inherently good people" and its inverse "rich people are all greedy and evil"
5767	Oh that makes it totally excusable then...	A man who died in 1965 at *age 90* was a racist? Say it ain't so!
5768	A little bit on the unoriginal side but I like the numbers.	BREAKING: Erik Jones 2017 Paint Scheme just released.
5769	Damn dude what's with all the Kyrie hate	I mean besides LeBron he's probably going to be the greatest Cavalier ever, right? #1 pick, already #10 in Cavs points scored, tons of clutch game winning shots, 3-time All Star, All-Star MVP, NBA Champion (in which he hit arguably the most clutch shot in history), ROY, FIBA MVP, 3-point contest winner, probably an olympic gold medalist after this summer, plus he's got a signature shoe with Nike, a viral marketing campaign with Pepsi in Uncle Drew, groomed by mentors like his Dad, Coach K, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James, and above all he seems seems to be just a cool relatable dude. Oh yea, and he has the sickest handles in the Association. I love Kyrie Irving if you can't tell.
5770	Well I didn't read the article and your opinion isn't as valuable as mine!	It didn't, this only includes public schools.
5771	Obviously this wouldn't happen in Haskell...	Object oriented programming gone wrong.
5772	Just another example of niantic keeping instinct down	Is it just me or are electric type Pokemon all in a pretty weak state right now? Like I have decently high CP Raichu, Jolteon, Electabuzz, Magneton and others. But I never really end up using any of them because all of the electric attacks besides thunderbolt seem pretty weak right now. Thoughts?
5773	Thanks Rachel.	Alberta unemployment rises to 8.6% in July, highest rate since 1994
5774	The funny thing is that all those drawbacks shows that sleep is incredibly important.	Sleeping is literally the most useless time wasting biological need to ever occur to all animals. 1. You're vulnerable while sleeping. 2. You waste a significant portion of your life doing it. 3. You could be off learning how to play the harpsicord while fornicating with it's sister instrument. Couldn't we just recharge our brains by eating more? Use all that excess calories most 1st worlders are eating, so that it could put to more productive use with our brains.
5775	Best thing to tell you is to use the "group with me" voice command, it pops an indicator of where you are at.	Could something be put in so that, when you say "I need healing", there's an indicator as to the direction of the nearest healer? Here's the thing about medics in this game: they need line of sight on you in order to heal you. If you're behind a wall a quarter of the way across the map and I'm Lucio, I'm not going to be able to heal you. And since Blizzard seems bound and determined to not let any class but healers see the silhouettes of teammates through walls, there needs to be some way to show someone where the nearest source of healing is. It's absurd. I was blamed for my team losing the last game because I didn't heal them. I COULDN'T heal them because they all insisted on running away from me when they needed healing, only to spam the button when they were halfway across the map. If you do that kind of shit, you're going to be relying on health packs, because I will not put up with that.
5776	I don't recall seeing it on the control scheme.	Can we crouch?
5777	It's not always easy to tell with a lack of inflection or intonation and	Well I'm joking obviously. XD

5780	Ray was talking about leaving for an LCK team about halfway through the split, so that gives some idea of the issues they had with him.	Between who specifically?
5781	But v3 has a shiny meta plate!	Baofeng UV-5R. Not the UV-5R+, UV-5R V2 or UV-5R 2SPOOPY EDITION but the plain old UV-5R. A lot of the rebadged versions are odd as far as battery comparability.
5782	When she was younger, she was credited as Haley King.	Is her name Haley or hunter? I'm confused :(
5783	Correct.	Pretty sure it's Saving Private Ryan.

5785	So the human world is actually a simulation and if we render the planet uninhabitable, we lose and find a way out?	When will the HUMAN world end? Once we render the planet uninhabitable. When will the ACTUAL world end? Supernova.

5790	Don't think I've heard that song before	Joe satriani
5791	Well please don't just take my word for it, and the women in your family probably tip better because they know the struggle.	The women being lower tippers thing surprises me, but there are a lot of waitresses in my family.
5792	Gah his flow change is brilliant around a third of the way in, been on repeat since release.	Frank Ocean - Nights
5793	Ya, I think I may be able to have hours of fun with that over the course of 2000 years or so.	Shoutout to my 2,000 year old Ball-in-a-Cup, replaced string but still hours of fun!
5794	Exactly my point!	omg lucky clip means game must be changed!
5795	Wait that cant be right, his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said he doesnt personally insult anyone.	Trump called Mika whatsherface "crazy"? Outreach to Republican women going *great*, I see.

5800	who needs cheats for Portal 2?	Only three of my friends even have the game anyways, and of course they're never online...
5801	I guess that's what's genuine to him	Your responses to the top two comments are borderline pathetic, you will not build a channel like that try to be more genuine
5802	maybe another bot could change that.	Don't think it will do much, unless they redo the entire poll. The top three are Zenia, Zeru and Nyami so those are our top three if they're following JP's style. At this point, most people who care have probably voted. It'd be a miracle for the results to change drastically.
5803	The twerk of '87	Fazbear and Friends or Foxy Gets Hooked? Which one do you think is better?
5804	Oh yeah and you can't run around like a twat spamming right click so you can jump out and insta people	The nerf wasn't that bad. All it did was make her deal less damage on body shots, but I think that most good widows know that they should always go for headshots. This just boosts that. This comment was made to inform readers of how Widowmaker was nerfed.
5805	Maybe it's time to invent a new religion and force everybody to follow along	Whatever. I think they need to ditch their religion and try something new in the area of governance.

5820	They're fighting Spinnin	The arc where the Monstercat rebelled against the music industry was cool, and representative of Monstercat's breakout phase as an independent label. The arc where the Monstercat went to all these well-drawn places was cool, and representative of Monstercat's forays into finding new artists even as the largest independent label in NA. The arc where the Monstercat seems to be fighting some evil cat(s) makes no sense whatsoever and just seems cringeworthy.
5821	You prolly ugly af though.	Woman here. Not interested in salary, it's none of my business. Not bothered about height. I swipe left to anyone with their top off. Dick size should be a surprise. I swipe right to: Men who fill the about me section in. Display a modicum of humour. Have a range of photos (i.e. not all mirror selfies). Seem friendly. Seem to have the same interests. Have beard and tattoos (personal preference).

5823	But they played teams with a higher defensive rating in the REGULAR season than what warriors had to go through.	I just don't see how this is a surprise to anyone... They just made it through the Eastern conference, big deal

5826	Yes but how do you git gud at dat kay/dee if you can't pick off people safely from a massive distance?	Remember, PTFO doesn't mean you have to sacrifice k/d. Shout out to my Reddit peeps for helping get close to 70% win percentage.

5832	Not after being on those crusty ass feet	you wanna sell?
5833	You know there is something going on.	I mean, people have been saying it. *I* would never say it, but people have been talking.
5834	The only way to stop a drunk with a gun is another drunk with a gun.	Because of booze? I've got mixed feelings, but don't think it's a bad idea. They had armed security, but I can understand not wanting to mix drinking and shooting.
5835	[Pretty sure using ANY items or methods to reset your hollowing immediately makes Yuria fuck off]	You can use purging stones. All they do is reset your hollowing to 0 whereas the fire keeper reverses it completely.
5836	The economy is really just like having a new carpet or hairstyle though isn't it?	I've heard people wanting to vote leave solely because it's time for a change and to try something new ffs
5837	ohh but you care enough to reply?	Then downvote my post and leave. I don't care if you are here.
5838	What are you talking about Trump is a beacon of human integrity, intelligence and honesty!	You can't possibly deal in New York City real estate and Nevada/New Jersey casinos without being heavily tied to organized crime. He certainly has received enough favors to strongly imply a link to the mob
5839	Jesus this isn't circlejerky at all.	TIL that the Baby Boomers were nicknamed the "Me Generation" due to their perceived narcissism.
5840	You mean he raped her?	Thank you. I stayed with my paternal grandparents as much as possible. She and I don't have a relationship anymore. She tried to have sex with my husband the night before we got married.
5841	Hey how do you have 7GB of RAM?	He can maths so hard.
5842	It shouldn't matter, the game is p2p.	I think it's because of the server overload due to steam summe sale and payday offering free2play at the moment
5843	Nah, mods must be anti-LGBT Muslims, that's the only thing that makes sense	Because it implies that the BLM protesters were there in an anti-LGBT capacity. I mean, you can see how that could be misleading right?
5844	Well naturally...i cant tell you how sinful it is until i see for my self.	"Gay people are sinners!" *watches lesbian porn*
5845	How do you explain Sonic X then?	So X translates into Generations for some reason. I mean, yes, Generations does fit MHX in general, but MHX has a pretty big "X" theme going on.
5846	Now do some cutting and let's see how she works!	I wanted to share my first sword. Info upon request.
5847	I knew it sounded familiar.	Ottawa is the capital of Africa. Come on. Everyone knows that.
5848	She might just be projecting really hard.	"Vanity is an ugly trait" She may be thinking of gluttony.

5851	IMO, this is a little disappointing.	Official: Xbox Games with Gold - August
5852	What seti news?	I can't claim credit for the image, sadly. Especially with the SETI news hitting IRL at the same time as Thargoids IG, I thought it was time to dust off this golden oldie.
5853	I hope these aren't real because I don't really want to have a card **with a sticker** and a card *without a sticker* to choose from	Sapphire and PowerColor Radeon RX 480 pictured as well
5854	I mean obviously it's gaudy and an example of too much opulence, but Trump just takes it to another level entirely.	I disagree, Versailles is gaudy as fuck. There is a reason it was looted during the French Revolution. That said, emulating the interior design style of God kings is quite telling.
5855	I didnt know those two competed, i loved bf3, what made COD win?	Makes me laugh because the last time I saw this argument be so vocal was in 2011 with Modern Warfare 3 vs Battlefield 3. MW3 fucking melted BF3, why would IW vs BF1 be any different?

5860	Finally, a grow op I'm interested in	It would be nice to be able to grow chicken tendies in my closet
5861	He wouldn't work with the Sedins at all	The article mentions that the Canucks are looking for a scoring winger to play with the Sedins, and that we didn't get Lucic, but seems to have forgotten about Eriksson. I pray we don't make a move for Kane. He's overrated.

5867	My point is that QC hasn't EoL'd support for SD80x.	The Nexus 6 is not the same hardware as the 5. It shares some things, and some are very similar, but its not the same.

5872	I use my dashboard since i can make sure my stream is smooth view my chat and easily change game/title	What do you use to watch your own stream activity? At the moment what I do is run OBS and keep my browser open on my dashboard page. Really all I care to keep track of while I stream is number of active viewers and chat. I don't care about seeing my own stream. Is the Twitch Dashboard what most twitch streamers use? Or is there special software elsewhere? Maybe an OBS plugin?

5882	Thank you	In the originals, the apes come back to our time after escaping the planet of the apes. They have a baby ape in our time who ends up being the catalyst for the ape revolution. I believe marky mark tried to come back to our time but missed it by enough that he was here for the early stages of the ape society. They had enough time to make ape Lincoln, but it was before the ape society went to shit because everyone knows apes cannot run society. OR before they realized humans and their guns are horrible and deliberately destroyed any evidence of human culture.

5895	You could always Power Word Tentacles!	You ever dealt with a 4/14 Deathlord without having access to Execute? That is more than likely where the idea came from. Unfortunately that is no longer the reality we live in any more. Priest's style of anchoring the board with a large taunt doesn't work anymore since both the tools no longer exist to do so (Velen's Chosen) Nor do any minions worthy of trying exist anymore. Without Deathlord or any cards like it Priest cannot function.

5912	Try swappa	Need some help here I'm trying to buy an iPhone 6s 64 gb space gray. I tried to use Swappa as many redditors recommended it for used phones. Had everything set up but everytime I try to buy something on swappa my PayPal keeps getting declined as its new and that much money made it suspicious. I desperately need a new phone as I currently don't have one. Could you guys show me some non-PayPal sites/options I could use? I appreciate your help.

5917	No way, all those military guys end up dead, disabled, or crazy.	Yeah a lot of it just depends on what job you land in the military, if you land a shitty job you're gonna have a shitty time. I myself landed a good job, I worked 4 on 3 off, 40 hours a week and 3 days off to do whatever I wanted! It was mad comfy.

5920	Draft a center	2017 Draft I think it's safe to say we will go into the draft next June with two top ten picks. I think the Lakers pick will finally fall out of the top 3 and if the Kings deal Demarcus at some point I think they will be in the top 3. Imo, the Sixers have the range next year from 2-7 maybe. If we end up with a lower pick than the Kings and we swap we will prob end up in the top 3 in some way. With those two picks I would be thrilled to get Josh Jackson and Markelle Fultz. I think they would solve our guard problems and could be the final pieces to the process, pending a possible free agent signing or two. That leaves with saying, where do you think our picks will fall (considering ours, Kings swap, and Lakers) and who would you like to get with those two picks?
5921	Kyogre :) getting online now	Sure! Which one would you prefer?
5922	It is a valid reason, as long as you aren't running as the person who will bring manufacturing back to America	I just saw that one this morning (NC). I love how Trump says "We employ the Bangladeshi, they gotta work too" as if it is a valid reason.
5923	It's called an acronym old man.	Meltzer: Anyone who uses words like IWC is hopelessly out of touch
5924	Eh, I wouldn't say brutal, it's more tongue-in-cheek, that way fans of Fox aren't actually offended, and opponents get a little pat on the back for watching their programming regardless.	Fox shows like Family Guy and The Simpsons make fun of the Fox Network and News, constantly and *brutally.*

5936	I've got a better idea, they can also pin white stars on their clothes when they walk around in public so everyone can see how privileged they are	They want white allies to outright identify themselves to make PoC more comfortable. Gee, if only there was a word for someone who was made uncomfortable by interacting with someone of a different race.
5937	But... but... they're "the party of Lincoln"!	The Republicans haven't been conservatives since Reagan got into bed with the religious right. They're reactionaries. Big difference.

5940	I'll try the hazards, since those are sometimes different bulbs, and a problem I'd found since posting this is that the hazard switch can cause problems in that year range for the model.	When the blinkers on my van go at double speed it means there is a burned out bulb somewhere, typically the back. Have you turned on your four-way flashers and walked around the car? Could it be a side blinker like on a mirror or something like that?

I'm glad I was told this. That two meals will ruin 120lbs lost. I should just give up. I didn't get fat because of two meals. Just like I won't get healthy by two meals. Stfu

5951	I'm fairly certain T-Swift hasn't done the "I'm a virgin" routine for several years now.	She's even come out saying she hasn't slept with everyone she's dated. She also talks at length about hating sex and has lyrics about it. I honestly think she may be nearly asexual.

5956	My mom gives me shit because I want to live with someone and get to know them and see if I truly want to spend the rest of my life with them before getting married - because apparently it's sinful to do that and instead you should be constantly chaperoned, never be alone, and then only have sex when you're married, because of course this is a good way to get to know the person.	That all aspects of sexuality are disgusting and should make you feel guilty even thinking about it.

5964	"I'm not racist, but...."	What phrase or sentence can someone say to make you completely lose your respect for that person?
5965	Yea, that's right,	How can the people deciding to give permission for the testing know if it's justified without the evidence to support what's in the motion? With that logic you can just write whatever to get the testing, if proof of what you're saying isn't required.
5966	There's Disneyworld in Paris, why bother going to the US...	Actually in the last few months there have been a few cases of very respectable, well-integrated, second/third generation British Muslims being prevented from boarding planes to the US to take their family to Disneyworld etc. because of their names. It has been well reported by the British Press.
5967	Damn your xenophobic, ego-centric, jingoistic, 'Murican attitude!	There is only one topping, and ketchup is it's name.
5968	He can't just change who he is, you jerk!	Dark triad works. (Well, not narcissism because I personally think it's silly but never mind.) The guy in the picture is kinda lame though. Yeah, many women openly claim they don't want dark triad traits, and openly say they want a 'sensitive, emotionally open guy' and that don't care about masculine strength. Maybe some are honest, but many are flat-out lying and only saying that because it's the socially acceptable thing to say these days. So what's to stop this guy from embodying strength and masculinity and being attractive? He identifies the problem, identifies the solution, and instead of *solving the damn problem already* he chooses to blame women. That's just stupid, and blaming unrelated 3rd parties for his own weakness.

5970	Harley Quinn looks hot af in the new Suicide Squad	Gay fag or Harley rider?
5971	I wonder if there are wives wondering where savings went...should be	It seemed like majority were blue collar - machinist, trucker, etc. Those can be decent paying blue collar jobs, to the point where you *could* technically blow hundreds of bucks on a pair of shoes, but no level headed person in that income range would. Maybe someone young, foolish, and fashion obsessed might, but not your average middle aged blue collar worker, or even white collar worker in that pay bracket. And middle age, blue collar women with families going out and blowing a thousand bucks on shoes? *Extremely* hard to imagine.

5973	Now you are trying to tell us this is an election?	Doesn't this also mean Trump has secured more votes this primary than any other GOP candidate in...ever?
5974	But it's all valuable conversation	Those of you who have reported the numerous site wide rule infractions by The_Donald and European, have the admins ever done anything or replied to you? My first report was the first Donald brigade targeting AHS and it took the admins almost two weeks to respond and they said "we'll look into it." After that, not a single report I made was answered.
5975	It was more cinematic for them	Strobelight is a bad way to put it, I think. It'd be more like a slideshow, or playing a game with a low fps. You can totally see what's there, but it might not look very real.
5976	Yea but you have to remember that since they are "Syrian refugees", they are all suspected terrorists.	Despite all the FUD, people are just people. What was that Mr. Rogers quote about horrible things? "Always look for the helpers."
5977	I doubt anyone would get that joke on reddit.	Sounds like something Cliff Clavin would say.
5978	I'm pretty sure your wife is going to make the decision for you when you have to start paying child support (if she has any sense and/or self-respect, that is).	Me with my wife i have been sleeping with another woman and she told me she's pregnant but I'm married.

5990	Well, duh, it was obviously the vaccines that over-stimulated the older son's immune system, making him have the food allergies...	There was a study recently that showed education and information will do nothing to change an anti-vaxxer's mind. It just makes them dig in their heels. It makes me crazy. My BFF's oldest son was diagnosed autistic and her husband somehow decided vaccines were the cause. He didn't want to vaccinate their younger son and my friend ended up going behind his back to do it because he threatened to divorce her. As it turns out, they figured out their older son had severe food allergies to many different things that affected his behavior, and once they got his diet under control, he was fine (he's no longer autistic). But her husband is still a diehard anti-vaxxer.
5991	The next Red Dead title is obvious Red Dead Revengeance.	Too early for a new GTA, my money is on RDR
5992	Shut your damn commie mouth!	The answer to that problem is communism. As long as the means of production are owned by few people who get all the cash any automated society fails. Or society is slowly failing since hundreds of years.

5995	Yeah dam you Liberals spending $300 million to help the most vulnerable around the world out of that $300 Billion dollar budget that was mostly spent on us.	Like no one in Canada could benefit from those kinds of funds. Run deficits and give it to foreign countries. Unemployment out west, bah, forget about it. It's only Alberta. They can suffer. Poverty and suicides on reserves? Bah, pay it some lip service and then send some cash overseas. Infrastructure? Borrow more later for that. Budget? Bah. It'll balance itself. One third of a billion dollars. Just thrown away. Just like that. Zero returns for Canadians, except maybe for one minute a few "progressives" can feel smug and satisfied that we did something for someone somewhere other than here in our own country.

6006	That was a rational and unbiased description of her.	Basically she's the definition of a politician. Her campaign is funded by the banks that helped cause the global economic crisis that destroyed millions of jobs, she voted for and gave speeches supporting the Iraq war which was illegal, unprovoked, and killed 100s of thousands of innocent people. She also supported the deregulation of those big banks and making our welfare programs harsher. imo before the GOP went totally loony she could have ran as a moderate Republican.

6027	I have a solution for the Kashmir and NE issueI.Give Kashmir to Pakistan and N.E to China who cares of the geographic importance of it.Ofcourse Pakistan would not demand Khalistan will it?	Nationalism is stupid for a simple reason: the nation never has and never will be static. 70 odd years ago, Japan annexed parts of Manchuria. The people Manchuria suddenly became Japanese subjects Should they suddenly start praising the nation of Japan? A few years later, as WWIi ended, Manchuria was once again absorbed by China Even look at India. Our present borders are very recent on a historical scale. What nation would someone living in remote Arunachal Pradesh have praised in 1947?

He says that Russia wouldn't need to offer if we had enough water bombers. I reply that we could have a million water bombers and Russia could still offer. The political blaming that happens in day-to-day life is mind boggling. Fuck I hate politics.

6054	About 100 of them are voting against their constituents by supporting clinton	They're allowed to vote out of what they think is best. They only are in the wrong if they don't change their vote to align with what their constituents.

6061	Nauplius?	Can I please get blood raider skins for my blood freighter so I can haul lots of blood to the blood thrown for the blood God in bloody style?
6062	Once they've signed the contract, there's not much the agent can do	I'm a little worried about Raola having so much power. What if there's a major fall out with him? We could lose 3 of our best players assuming Pogba came Though by that stage Zlatan would be gone probably but food for thought
6063	Like a glove.	How would As Monaco fit in in Serie A?
6064	Check your cis-gendered privilege at the door.	So we have vitamins for men and women because our bodies require different combinations of nutrients and vitamins. Why is it so outrageous to do this with bread? Are there no bigger issues in the world?

6070	In a free market it's also your right to bitch about someone else's product.	in a free market, they have every right to set any stipulation they wish, and you have every right to refuse to do business with them. don't like their terms? go find a different group. They'll either give up trying to fill, or there are enough people out there that find those terms acceptable. sounds like this guild is one that you, I, and people in this thread would prefer to take their business elsewhere.
6071	The time travel stuff allowed them to avoid overwriting the continuity of the original shows and movies, and allowed them to still make a product with the classic characters that wasn't beholden to the shows.	Because they had no reason to use time travel in the first one, but spewed it all over the place just for the hell of it to get Nemoy involved.
6072	Fuck you, Team Z is the best, Team Y is utter shit though.	No but seriously Fuck Team Z
6073	Democratic Socialism ... just like the Nazi Party	As a Bernie Sanders supporter, I liked his article, and especially since he used "democratic socialism" instead of "socialism". I think I am also sort of on his side. This primary process has shown me how corrupt the DNC and Hillary are. Way more than the Republican Party or Trump. Therefore, I won't be voting Hillary, and will do as much as I can to get DWS out of office, so someone new can turn things around.
6074	Have you two checked your privilege?	You and me both.
6075	username checks out	Eccolo: Certo che la computer grafica ha fatto passi da gigante. Sembra vero.
6076	Yeah, guilting young women into sex acts they're uncomfortable with is so hot and spicy.	This response is gold man. Like seriously. Another shitty guy getting spicy sex but your own future husband who loves you clearly can't get it? Sad
6077	Well, it burns burns burns, the ring of fire	Burning Ring of Fire
6078	I choose to believe that popcorn is popping on the apricot tree.	The first crack in her shelf

6083	Nah, he's one of us!	Dont bother this guy is a moron
6084	Yeah, that'll show them.	Mourners spit on Nice terrorist's 'hate memorial'
6085	I think he referring to why people flipped shit, I think everybody would drop dedo for scump without hesitation.	It was nothing about his attitude. They were all set to pick him up because rosters were going to lock in a couple days. They played in a 5K on Sunday, rosters were going to lock on Tuesday for the next league season (or maybe Champs qualifiers). Scump saw how they played in the 5K and told Nade he wanted to come back. Dedo's attitude surely didn't help, but when Scump said he wanted to come back, it wouldn't have mattered if Dedo was as professional as Teepee or Merk.
6086	I for one thank Turnbull for stopping the boats, as soon as those migrants heard about him changing is to fttn they decided to look for another place to settle.	Malcolm Turnbull Claims He's 'Turned Around' An 'Utterly Failed' NBN
6087	You raise a lot of good points, but while Nvidia has held the performance crown for the past few years, AMD has held it multiple times in the past; It's happened before, and it may or may not happen again.	How many times are we going to say, 'I hope AMD knocks it out of the park with [insert newest architecture here]' until we realize that day will probably never come. Don't mean to sound snarky, but I think the performance disparity isn't going anywhere and the only way to affect pricing is to vote with your wallet. You don't like Nvidias prices? Buy AMD.

Then he'll have to flee Oldtown after retrieving his sword that he had hidden away in some rocks.
6100	got an email as well today :/	Given that Nintendo us involved, don't expect to get a shirt. If they can stop it, it'll be stopped.
6101	But he is going to create MILLIONS of jobs.	Trump never clarifies how he intends to make life better for Americans or anyone else. He literally has no idea how to accomplish anything.

6111	Good thing he'll be the UNIVERSAL champion then	I'm torn. I want Balor to show up as the demon, but I also don't think he's ready to be World Champion yet - unless they turn him heel which I don't see happening.
6112	You can't tell my children how to eat	I used to volunteer at an elementary school as a teachers aid for kindergarten kids. If their parents packed unhealthy snacks, they weren't allowed to eat it unless all the healthy options were eaten first and they were still hungry. The school also provided free fresh fruit and healthy snacks for kids every day at lunch. Every public school where I live has this, thanks to the government. Little kids don't eat that much, so the unhealthy food (chips, candy) usually went uneaten. I love Ontario!
6113	Yeah make meths in international waters... because customs won't notice.	I don't think jack sparrow needs to throw meth into the mix.

6116	This made me bawl in the theater.	The medical exam scene from "Captain Phillips" was improvised by real-life Navy Corpsman Danielle Albert who was told to follow her usual procedure. This is also Tom Hanks at his best.
6117	Serious question: How is this racist?	Neil Turner: (Random Alt-Righter on Twitter who has been previously reblogged by Donald Trump) just posted this picture in a tweet.
6118	They used the broomsticks in one single exercise.	Those incidents highlight the difference between reported capacity and real capacity. If they were actually as capable as they claim, they wouldn't need to use broomsticks. Nor would they need to rely on the UK and France to handle every single situation that is relevant to Europe's best interest. Nor would they be calling on NATO before they bother to improve themselves first and setting an example.
6119	Oh no you have to play final level content properly now	I think the stamina refund is bad news... at least for me it is. If previously it was 1 stamina per try, I could use Hit &amp; Run. But if they put in 60 stamina requirement, you can't use Hit &amp; Run to build your SB to clear trash mobs because you are running and you won't get your stamina refund unless you are wiped.

6124	you had a healer on PTR?	Healers getting screwed in placement rank Our team recently finished out placement games in the PTR. We did pretty well with a solid 9/10 wins. We all scored in the upper 3800 range, except for our healer who scored 3333. Our healer definitely was not the worst on the team, averaging 11k heals for pretty short games and getting cards for 50% kill participation every other game. She also had several rezzes that got POTG and saved the game for us. However, she somehow got placed low enough to where half our team cannot play with her seemingly just because she heals. Are any other healers experiencing this?

6127	Says some one who has never started from zero.	3 pull ups is easy. Start with just hanging on the bar, then try as hard to pull your self up. when you get tired have a break and then try again. Keep going untill you get the first pull up and the rest is history. Building yourself take time and will power. For the rest of the combat training I can't comment on how ready you would be.

Step 4: Sell your puts as the stock starts tanking.
6131	Sure, but some of them, he assumes, are good people.	It is pretty obvious what he was up to when he rejects multiple invitations to speak in front of minority groups and chooses instead to do his "minority outreach" at rallies full of his core white supporters. And he fills his "outreach" with negative stereotypes of minorities
6132	Yeah but Bernie is against TPP, and Bernie is literally the best thing since breadlines.	Don't even try. Reddit upvotes conspiracy theories like the TPP will mean the government can monitor your computer. Ask the average redditor what the TPP does and they'll say, "move jobs to China," not knowing that China isn't even a part of the TPP. That the TPP is basically an economic version of NATO, aimed at China like NATO is aimed at Russia.
6133	Yeah they're both the same.	Both fucking suck. Period.

6140	Happy cake day!	He found a loophole in this system and I for one dislike him immensely for it. I kid, I kid. It got a laugh out of me.
6141	Who cares we won't have an ozone too long from now anyways.	I believe it would instantly destroy the ozone, then remaining gamma rays within the same burst would hit the surface. Everyone would be hit with extreme radiation poisoning and die a pretty quick, but miserable, death.

6149	Better buy some upgrades for your player with real money.	Terrible, isn't it? I ended up playing QB so I could just audible out of dumb calls. Not that other sports games are any better. After throwing a no-hitter in my minor league debut, The Show decided to slowly up the difficulty over the next two months. Then, suddenly, it cranked and I can barely find the strike zone.
6150	Yea back when I was a wrestler and I was qualified for off season national tournaments I didn't train because my coach told me I didn't have to	Regarding the G2 vacation drama, people need to realise that it's not the players fault
6151	You bring the bath salts, I'll bring the baby alligators.	Floridian here as well, should we get the bath salts ready?

6165	Because the primary voters definitely represent the values as the entire populace!	Seeing as how they both received the most votes by a sizeable margin, I'm going to have to disagree with this gif. Dank as it is.
6166	Maybe they missed it	I was in Albany International this morning going through TSA. A pilot and 2 stewardesses cut the line directly in front of me to go through security. I watched the pilot put his bag, with a full liter bottle of water resting on top, go right through the scanner and he grabbed it on the other side. I was shocked, and almost mentioned it to the TSA, but they clearly allowed it and I didn't feel like finding out what might happen to me if I pursued it. There are security gaps absolutely everywhere.
6167	But when she gave those millions of dollars of speeches, she didn't *know* she was gonna run for president!	Yeah you are correct.
6168	I wouldn't worry about it, we got some pretty solid returns out of Denard Span, Ben Revere, and Aaron Hicks.	On Opening Day, did you think the Twins starting outfield on May 20th would be Sano, Danny Santana and Robbie Grossman? The darkest timeline, my friends.

6172	I'm honestly surprised no one has commented about the website the image goes to... seriously?	Does anyone else watch this guy on Youtube?
6173	Its to show how verysmart they are to feel superior to others as a former verysmart person and an IQ of 169 i would expect you lesser minds to understand.	I always wonder what these people expect from commenting on a video or image like that. Is everyone going to see it and acknowledge them as a greater being or something? Like where is the goal?

6181	But but but... why would OPs title lie?	Paine was not founding father. He was a propagandist and revolutionary. Common sense helped spark the revolution but he, in no way, participated in the founding of the country.
6182	Trump's a jerk, plain and simple.	Trump's attack on a judge's Mexican heritage is an attack on the American Idea
6183	You just don't know what you want.	Awesome :D I don't know why they're so keen to "fix" it anyway. Maybe limit it to a stack of three but let people do it. Is it just so people will use their precious shelves? We don't all want large spaces in our bases for those obnoxiously large shelves, and nobody wants the irritation of having to dance around them to get boxes placed correctly because the placing system won't allow us to rotate.
6184	Yay.	Same things happening in Tacoma
6185	I can't imagine there being distractions in the audience of a NASCAR race.	That means the cameramen are doing a great job, right? It's incredible that they can get such great shots with no distractions when the audience is right there!
6186	once BFZ rotates itll be playable; is that a possibility that you were hinting at?	I love how desperately everyone is trying to convince themselves that Emrakul is playable.
6187	I wonder whose millions are larger though?	That's true and same with Sanders. Your statement doesn't do anything to address what I said.
6188	but the human eye can only see 24fps!	Slower Melee: A build that puts the game at 30fps, set's the speed to Brawl's level, and adds input buffering.

6195	But that's what everybody does, right?	I like that he was genuinely filling it out instead of choosing the first option for everything
6196	Maybe he meant to say "my driver's favourite driver"	Drivers isn't possessive.
6197	No, that's who real guns are for.	Sometimes even a broke black guy!
6198	Yes but he can't readily imagine it, so it must be intrusive and not helpful	Heads up displays have been used for years, in both cars and fighter jets.
6199	Yes they do and afterwards the pee is used as lube so that the driver can slide out of the car faster.	My gf asked me if drivers pee on themselves during 24h races. Do they?
6200	Luckily they upgraded to glorious nippon steel so they could use straight edged blades instead of curved ones.	I wonder how many poor saps had to experience the flat blade prototypes.
6201	Yeah Trump would have been an amazing Secretary of State.	Hillary is far worse. Trump may be an asshole, but he is not responsible for the amount of death Hillary is.
6202	I don't speak Spanish but i hear ya man.	Yeah. I have been very generous in rewarding myself with some bombass ice cream. I lost weight with MFE but there's just this... Je ne sais quoi about Exam C that has made me really let myself go.
6203	You are a race traitor that sided with the evil white devil!	The store I work at has a lot of Hispanic customers.
6204	Yeah, a single mother accepting help from her father in law SUREE sounds manipulative.	That was before any of this. Her and Mike never had a great relationship to begin with, now shes manipulating him. Try to keep up
6205	I kinda like having it showing, and you can hide it if you want, but to each their own.	Yeah, that too. Although I'm not sure if that's truly fullscreen, since the taskbar is still showing.
6206	Because you're a misogynist and only misogynists point out things that solely benefit woman	Then why do 4x more scholarships exist for women? why are women 60% of the college students these days? Why is there a drive to put more women in STEM when they don't naturally choose to go into such majors? Why are we lowering the bar across the board for women?
6207	Lets get the customers to build the game for bungie	I wish Bungie had some sort of a program so we can help them get content right, or just out the door. Many of us here can write code, design or have enough common sense to tell when something isn't right. Some of us are willing to help Bungie, even if it is just testing. Have us sign a NDA, and let us help you to help us.
6208	Great content.	How to play Black Ops 3, a guide written by observing my teammates. Ive decided since I'm not a great player, I should take inspiration from all the teamates I have had. I observed them over the last month or so, and wrote this handy guide to share my knowledge. 1. Always vote for Combine. And if it's not an option and doesn't come up when you vote random, leave the lobby. It's the only way. 2. Never shoot down UAVs/CUAVs/HATRs/etc. It wastes valuable killing time. 3. If you are playing an objective based game remember that if you actually go near the objective, you will probably die. It's best to avoid doing that. 4. If you see a teammate trying to run away from a gun fight, you should block their path to punish them for their cowardice. 5. If you play hardcore, remember that no matter what the main objective is to kill whoever killed you. Especially if it was a teammate. 6. Even if you are only down by 1 point, losing a match is unacceptable. Leave the game to make sure you don't lose. 7. If you know where the enemy is camping, you should run towards them. If it doesn't work the first time, it's because of lag, and you should try again. 8. If they are better than you, they are hacking, and you should send them a message calling them out on their bullshit. 9. It's perfectly fine to play loud music over your mic. Everyone will appreciate your music and it will raise squad moral. 10. Speaking of mics, the best thing to do is to have the mic volume up so high that you broadcast all your gunfire to everyone, so they know how awesome you are. Hope this helps, and that you have a wonderful CoD experience!
6209	Whatever, that game is a classic before the first line of code was written.	you mean like the 11000+ ratings on Gears 4
6210	That's what ya get for not buyin MERICAN!	!? I had to have this done for my ex-wife's car, Mitsubishi Eclipse, and it was $100+. My own car, an older Audi, at the Audi dealership is over $200 for a new key!
6211	Then you miss out on all the cool animations and noises, that's half the fun.	If key fragments have no other use apart from crafting into a key shouldn't they automatically be turned into a key when you get 3 of them? I mean the only reason I can think of for not doing this is Riot has some other plan for key fragments but I heavily doubt this as they haven't really talked about doing that.

6215	Where does it say "people who disagree with me should die?"	People are going to defend the fuck out of this because they like Fallout. " hurr durr it's a joke, it makes sense, it's a reference" Doesn't change the fact that it's a person making a joke about killing people who disagree.

6220	BLAINE	I used to live in a U.S. border town just south of Vancouver. Canadians were *notorious* in my town for coming down to take advantage of American prices, a (then) favorable currency exchange, and of course the advantage of avoiding both B.C. and WA sales taxes by claiming everything duty free. We're talking some of the biggest hold ups I've seen in a Costco because the majority of shoppers are making *damn* sure they don't get charged a dime of Washington sales tax. Just add all of the garbage left in parking lots and strewn about the highways because everybody is unboxing all of their stuff to avoid paying any duty, and it isn't hard to see why the people who live in that town don't like Canadians very much.

6226	Too busy keepin those homer glasses on.	Is it just me, or does Jack often have NO IDEA what's happening on the ice? He never knows where the faceoff is, or what the call is...Brick always has to politely correct him..sounds like he's getting sick of it. It's as if his grasp on the rules isn't that strong.

With Ninja in the fold now where would you place him? I'm guessing still 10th, but solid rankings I'd say if this were 3-4 weeks ago Jensen would not be as high as he is now.

6253	hey op im planning on getting a bird have u got any advic	Do some research on a pet before coming to the store to buy one. Yes I know what is needed and how to care for one. It's one of the main reasons that I'm there. But it's important to know if the pet will work with your lifestyle and budget. It's frustrating to spend sometimes almost hour explaining everything and gathering the supplies when a customer decides they'd rather not spend all the time and money on what was just going to be an impulse buy. They are living creatures, not some toy.
6254	do u like borderlands?	Audio packs? Go on...
6255	You're hilarious.	Force those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder to bail out those at the top when the investments of the financial institutions form bubbles and burst. Austerity measures are backwards. Why should millions suffer then a handful of people can take one for the team. I think that any amount of time spent as a billionaire is good enough. Consider yourself lucky for the temporary privilege and pay it forward.
6256	If it's just basic first aid it's really easy, although usually they have that shit planned in advance where all the employees can go at the same time.	Only downside is that I need one more qualification within the first 6 weeks, which is a first aid certificate. while not mandatory for the job I'm doing, the company I'll be working for prefers that their staff are first aid certified in case shit happens I guess. Which I don't mind, it's something that while handy i hope to never have to use.

6259	But that's not how people use that phrase, and you know that.	That's not how it works. The lowest *common* denominator is something we *all* have in common. Imagine a table with a meal and ten people. Someone says they don't like salt, so we take away the salt. The next person says they don't like potatoes, so we take that away. The list goes on, but the end result is that we're left with something that barely resembles what any of the ten people wanted.

6266	Slightly surprised I find myself upvoting you here.	No. Burning timber releases carbon dioxide. (more than coal) Many of these trees grow back very slowly. In the meantime, the carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere creating global warming that can lead to things like methane hydrates melting and arctic ice thinning and arctic permafrost holding methane to release the methane. Also, there is no requirement to plant trees back when harvesting timber in foreign countries for Europe. Additionally, old wood/dead wood is important for biodiversity.
6267	I think you meant: Don't mind, dickhead!	Don't mind *the* dickhead.
6268	So, it's genetics?	Yup, I have to fight saying anything bad about overweight people on Facebook because I know I will get tons of shit for it. Doesn't help that like half my family, on one side, is overweight. They would probably uninvite me from Christmas.

6274	For me, I got some symptoms in my eyes, the ophthalmologists did MRI (twice), and came back with a shrug...	Well I'll tell ya what, it's almost certainly not a brain tumor. But, I had like every blood and heart test on the planet to tell me that. Do you have migraines? They thought it was silent migraines for me. If you're concerned, get a CT/MRI. They are not that pricey to give you the peace of mind if you ask me, and way less pricey than all the other tests I had done to tell me "well holy shit you have a brain tumor! Well golly gee that has to come out!" Mine is benign, they don't know the cell type which means a lot, they also don't know how long it's been in there, probably a while for mine because it is a slow growing kind. Brain tumors are shitty because they come back a lot, even benign ones. But you know, what can you do. But you probably don't have a brain tumor, they are very rare. If by some chance you have one, you come find me and I'll be your buddy.

6289	Then when I try to point one out I end up being wrong and she won't focus on anything else until she pulls up imbd or wikipedia and *proves* I'm wrong.	My wife does this stuff too.

It was an accident and didn't happen because I was messing around or not holding my equipment properly. I'm not mad about it, so y u mad bro? If anything, I'm impressed that they got the knives so damn sharp to make such a clean cut.

6297	Well you would need to take 4 of those tabs (with tolerance) to feel the effect of one of those tabs (without tolerance) so money wise not worth.	I tripped on friday though and it was pretty instense. So I wouldn't mind it being slightly duller.
6298	Well this is going to make for an interesting off season for us Laker fans	Brooks was intrigued by Lakers gig, and Rockets wanted him, but Washington worked quickly 4 a deal before LA and/or Houston jobs opened.
6299	I fundamentally agree!	It's the disease of all ideologies, not just religion
6300	At my school we have these, and we even play older games and stuff besides league, CS:GO, and the big games	LAN parties! Playing games online is fine but there's something really great about being in the same room with a bunch of your friends, connecting your PC's, ordering a ton of pizza, and just gaming for 48 straight hours or whatever.
6301	And don't forget that climate change is a hoax created by china to undermine US industry!	the problem with Trump is mixed on abortion (he changes position a lot here), wants to ban people from entering the US based on their religion, wants to build an infeesably expensive and ineffective wall, impose crippling tariffs all over the dam place, and engage in the most aggressive deportation plan every conceived by a politician. Everything about him screams bankruptcy and unconstitutional abuse of power for the US. Not something anyone should want for the whitehouse. And that's not counting that he casually suggested committing warcrimes/crimes against humanity in the war on terror. His supporters get so hung up on the anti establishment vibe they seem to miss the forest for the tree. His one good quality does not make up for the dozens of bad ones.
6302	You mean thrift stores aren't like libraries?	I work at goodwill, and the thing I hate most is people who steal, specifically they come in with things to replace the stolen items.. First of all, I will be clear and say that it's a Tucson goodwill so everything is stupid dirty cheap. Like I could get a whole 40 pc dish set for like 10 bucks at the most or a almost never used mountain bike for 20 bucks, it's ridiculous lol. So yeah, the thing that bothers me the most is when people come in wearing their super gross shoes or flippy floppies and they will simply find the pair they want, put it on, and then leave the older shoes behind in the same place and walk right out the store if you aren't staring at them hard enough. Or when they rub off the price and ask me what it is and I tell them the price on a pair and they say they don't want it, but as soon as they come to my register I see them trying to hide it in their purse or something and I gotta point them out like I'm some bitch. Shit gets me everytime man.

6307	Free shipping?	My dad has Prime. Guess I know what I'm doing tonight or tomorrow.
6308	Not necessarily his dick, but a bag of dicks	I can't recall a single bit when he's talking about his dick, and I've seen his videos so many times it's not normal. I'm not saying he doesn't do that kind of jokes at all, but it's a very small portion of his jokes.
6309	Am I the only one that thought it was Thomas Roux?	No, he's talking about the tip of the flame. When committing arson, you always want to make sure you are using the tip of the flame. Using the base of the flame can be cumbersome while trying to burn down your ex's house before she gets back from blowing Thomas Roo in a Denny's parking lot. It's also just plain unsafe.
6310	Of course it's a hoax, everybody knows celebrities aren't regular people and can't just die from natural causes.	David Bowie's Death A HOAX!

6313	No you would still be .01 yards short.	Well, you only need more than 3.33 YPC for that to be true, on average. But there's an old adage about the man who drowned in a pond that was an average of 1 inch deep.
6314	We didn't get hard hats, but we did chant an extremely inappropriate song for first year students.	Holy shit, I was there for that. It was DUES (Dalhousie Undergraduate Engineering Society) that ran it. It was in the Dunn building. We then got black hard hats and when down to the other campus to hear speeches from the Dean among other things. The third question had velociraptors in it, and I cheated profusely.

6320	Rather have Mignolet	Di Marzio: Manchester United have been scouting Italian keeper Mattia Perin as a backup incase De Gea leaves in the summer for Madrid
6321	Nice man!	I did something similar. I was kicked out of high school and feeling bad that I didn't graduate. One day, I went to the community college my brother was attending and asked to take a placement test while I waited for him to finish registering for classes. On the test, I wrote that I had graduated from the high school I attended. After I was done with the test, I decided I'd try registering for classes with my results sheet that said I had a diploma. No problems registering, so I rolled with it. Two years later, I graduated. Got a copy of my transcript and it said I had the high school diploma from my high school, as well as the degree I had earned. I was admitted to the university of my choice, and two years after that, I had two degrees and a fake high school diploma. Not looking back.
6322	Comment replies, messages, pings all go into the same message folder on reddit as far as I know.	Honestly with how frequently he gets his username pinged I'd bet he probably just never looks at PMs.
6323	Take the cancer like a man, the way your great-great grand-daddy did.	The American dream is sold on the premise that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps. The reality is that gravity doesn't work that way. For you to move up, you have to step on someone else on the way up. The average American has no voice in government. Big corporations align with one of two parties to select candidates, write laws, and bribe their sponsored politicians to pass them. Healthcare is a private business and not a public service. What the average American wants is irrelevant; it's what CEOs decide to lobby for that determines how healthcare actually works. Like everything else Obama wanted, healthcare is just another neutered failure because corporations don't want it to be single payer and price limited.

6327	She's banned in a lot of my bronze games so she must be op!	Don't overbuff her. I like that nobody bans this champ.
6328	This comment collapses under a weight of self importance and pretentiousness.	The film is a technical marvel truly but it does get a tad too self-important for its own good. The story it's trying to tell oftentimes doesn't match the tone of the film, collapsing under a weight of self importance and pretentiousness. With that said, it is a beautiful film. A punishing, and brutal journey about survivalism and redemption. It's gritty, and dirty and dark much like the American frontier it depicts.
6329	I hope you just didn't use an	Foles easily.

Luckily after she brought the police officer over he just threw it in the trash can and told the lady she was wasting everyones time.

6363	FUK U EA SHILL	Yeah I don't get why some people have gone out of their way on here to be negative. Personally I dislike this FIFA a lot and I was one of the most active users on this subreddit from like 13-15. Instead of just being negative I have found other games that are really fun. For some reason some of the people on here don't understand that there are other really fun games available now. Why waste your time playing a game you don't enjoy? Then come on here and bitch?
6364	Great to hear and have fun with your new rig!	As you were so helpful I thought I should inform you: I am the biggest dumbass! I was so focused on the Graphics Card itself that I didn't look at the PSU where, low and behold, a wire was loose! Everything is working now!
6365	Yeah but are those metric miles?	As someone in Europe, you guys have it much better with the EPA. Not only are they close to the real world mpg (for ICE cars), but will actually go as far as to update their ratings if consumers complain that they aren't getting close to those figures in the real world. For comparison's sake. Model S EPA rated range: 230-288 miles depending on model Model S NEDC (Europe) rated range: 260-340 miles
6366	*poke poke*	I can't stop watching this...
6367	Twat waffle, cunt nugget... I had more of these names memorized when I wasn't so upset by the idea of someone being forced into a pregnancy they don't want.	I was going to go with twat waffle, but you are right. This situation warrants the use of cunt.
6368	Thank you!	Thats solid. Nice piece man.
6369	When the next expansion comes out, because by then it'll be free :-D	When should I get Heart of Thorns? I'm still a newer player, been playing for about 2 weeks now. I was looking at Heart of Thorns, but held of due to the $50 price tag. Does the expansion do anything big for new players, or should I hold off until a certain level?
6370	You might want to try this on ELI5 or nostupidquestions	I walked up to an escalator today, knowing full well it wasn't working, how did my mind still trick me into thinking it was moving when I stepped onto it?
6371	Thanks!	Much appreciated. Congrats on becoming a mod!
6372	If you need help with animation sprites I can help :)	Maybe.. It would be fun but I am not sure it's worth "wasting" my time and energy on it :P
6373	It's a karma conspiracy	You gif makers are slacking, I had to wait like 5 whole minutes for this to be uploaded!

6387	Yeah...that'd be the tames one of the bunch probably, and that was egregious itself.	I'm only referencing the first incident, "drug offender resisting arrest". I didn't realize this was an album.

6398	next you'll tell me that Samus' final smash doesn't turn her into Zero Suit anymore.	So some people didn't know this but, if you've wanted to see Bowser's old moveset in Smash 4 just use a smash ball Giga Bowser has all of Melee Bowser's moveset (besides side B I think, give it a try!) It's pretty interesting to see his melee moveset be used as Giga Bowser but his Smash 4 used as normal Bowser

6405	I'm unsure of the first question, are you asking where you can get the armor?	Bad ass! Do we think the armour model depend on what level you are when you first visit the location? Thanks for the heads up by the way, I had no idea this place existed!

6416	Counterfeit happiness.	From what I've experienced, the reconciliation is that your happiness is only temporary and immediate because you're sinning, but in the long run, you won't be happy. Mormons bank on sacrificing now for something better after death. That's a pretty risky wager to waste your life in hopes of something after you die without proof.

6422	Still no SLI support due to being a universal Windows whatever, right?	Nah its really good now, runs really smooth with no issues. At launch a few weeks ago it had issues but now its in a really good spot
6423	Of course bathrooms don't count as discrimination	Just so I'm clear then, you don't think gendered bathrooms count as discrimination? Because you are bending over backwards to try and say they aren't. The government isn't saying men can't use women's bathrooms. The government also isn't saying you can't use this app.

6430	Jesus fucking Christ this entire argument is retarded Iron men don't deserve special privileges, they knew exactly what they were getting into in starting this account Having the ability to kill a boss isn't a privilege, it's a huge part, if not almost the entirety of endgame content, they aren't out of line fit thinking they shouldn't lose a huge amount of their kills because someone trolls and knocks out a hit, there's several incredibly obvious solutions to this issue but there's no way to do so with how normal players would react over the matter The fact is, ironmen knew what they were getting into when they created their account yes, but they have every right to speak their mind on how a currently broken and abused system could be fixed, people need to stop with these bullshit arguments about them limiting themselves, yes they choose to limit themselves, we all fucking know this that doesn't mean that if they're capable of doing so, they still shouldn't be able to go bossing like any other player would, the way it's handled at the moment isn't fair to those who worked their assess off to get there, likely SUBSTANTIALLY harder than anyone who crashes them on a regular basis This stupid fucking back and forth bickering needs to stop and we all just need to admit that as it stands iron man is broken in this perspective, and stop with this you limit yourself bullshit, they limited the fuck out of themselves and still made it to this point, they've earned the right to kill this boss just like any other player without having to worry about a single fucking damage making them lose their kill	NO. iron men should stop bitching for being crashed in multi zones

6438	Yeah, I'm sure she was coming home from church.	I absolutely agree. A lot of witch burners in here. You said it the best when you said you could have had her baking you a pie in a few minutes, that is exactly the real point. Instead the cop created a huge amount of risk by escalating to physical force. Anyone incapable of de-escalating a 77 year old woman on her way home from church needs to quit being a cop, it's profoundly fucking pathetic, no matter how shitty her attitude is.

Then sold the network to Telstra, who fund Liberal campaigns, for less than a 1/4th of what they then bought it back again for 1 year later. If you want to blame anyone blame the Liberal party.

6460	I'm guessing real GNP too, assuming national GNP is nominal, so that dividing by CPI controls for inflation, which gives a value normalized to a base year.	What is the ratio of national GNP to CPI called? The question is: "What is the ratio of national GNP (Gross National Product) to CPI (Consumer Price Index) [times 100] called? a) a measure of inflation b) real GNP c) real income d) Producer Price Index e) none of the above This question confuses me mightily. I think it is "real GNP", but I think it might also be "none of the above", as the book mentions defalting GNP will give "productivity". Any help is greatly appreciated.
6461	Yeah.	Because we don't use the gold standard anymore, our currency is not backed by gold. The only reason it has "value" is because the Federal Government says it does.

6472	Yeah the Trump plan will be INCREDIBLE, arguably the BEST THING AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN.	I want something YUGE.
6473	Because their blogs are triggering Trans people who are super mentally stable	Sure gender is fine. Live your life as whatever gender you want, it doesn't affect anyone else. But why demean the otherkin when they're just living their lives the way they want and aren't affecting anyone else either?
6474	He's supporting the company by doing promotion on social media, which is basically ALL communication that a brand like TSM has with their audience.	There's a difference between "supporting" and "promoting" that can be argued in the most strict or broad sense. Getting the team from point A to point B by working out travel plans is absolutely supporting their activities. Posting on twitter of team's results or future matches is absolutely promoting their activities. Whether or not it actually supports them can be argued both ways.

6481	That's perfect, thanks	The system transfer moves all licenses and all downloaded games to the new console. Basically, just think of it as once you are done with the transfer, the new console will be exactly how the old one was, including theme and layout, as long as you do it right. It's similar to restoring an iPhone or iPad from backup, if you've ever done that.

6483	I can only think of one solution to stop this abuse: erect a build at the border and make the USA pay for it.

Did anyone read the drifting classroom? It's pretty okay
6514	Ya, I mean, girls definitely don't get anything out of sex.	You guys are getting ridiculously fixed on the idea that she *might* expect him to pay for dinner (even though she says nothing to suggest that, which already shows you're not even giving fair consideration). Firstly, despite what you might think, his is clearly an exchange being offered. Something that she wants, in exchange for something the guy wants. *Even if it involves the guy spending money on her*. The guys on tinder are on there because they want to date or have sex with the girls. Your logic suggests that the whole thing is an entirely selfless endeavor on the part of men, and that any girl who goes on a date is the sole beneficiary. If you disagree with that, then both parties must get something out of it, making this exchange, and not entitlement.

6534	Could be they are great or could be they were undefeated until last week so voters were riding their jocks.	I know that there's always snubs and guys who get in who shouldn't have, I realize that. But any team with 10 probowlers is a great team.
6535	They won CT pistol on cache, and T pistol on mirage.	All pistols lost*
6536	I agree.	I'm not telling people not to protest, just to do it outside the venue where they can't get hurt. This is a win-win situation for them since they can kick and scream all they want out there, and are legally protected since they are in a public space.
6537	I say we hide Morty... Worst case scenario were back to running...	You can't run You can't hide
6538	Is there any particular reason that US forces wreck UNSC troops?	UNSC. Why? Because they have spaceships and millions more soldiers. On the ground, 2050s USA absolutely wrecks the UNSC marines or ODSTs, although they're not quite at Spartan level. However, they don't have the aerial or space-based firepower to take on a UNSC fleet.

6542	The only speech I have left is one more in front of the district board, and those ones are pretty easy	Sounds like a good time, rather relaxed, except for the whole speeches and excitement generation and responsibility for school board responsibilities. Psyched to give another speech, in front of many more people and for an important event? ~~no pressure~~ XD
6543	Nah, you're thinking of 18 years ago.	PCIE? Pretty sure 15 years ago people were using AGP.
6544	Yep, so let's keep rewarding countries with cheap electricity, because that totally makes sense.	Having 1tbps local bandwidth is besides the point. Its not USACoin, bandwidth has to apply globally and as far as china is concerned, your 1tb fibre connection will struggle to get 100kbps thru the GFW
6545	Lack of motivation	If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?
6546	Pfffff, "facts".	If we're going by percentage of the population, French speakers are already overrepresented in the NB government and public service.
6547	[The JaguarBoard](http://jaguarboard.org) is another alternative that is currently on kickstarter.	I'd recommend the BeagleBone Black. More than enough power to do what you need while still keeping the budget in check.

6551	Are you telling me KD isn't the emaciated corpse of Shawn Kemp?	You know 'Zombie Sonics' is just a turn of phrase, right?
6552	Good point.	I imagine wrestling math is a little less bullshit considering you're not going to come up with as much variance in styles as you will with MMA.
6553	For the same reason "everybody" thinks citizens united, 3rd-wave feminism, and Bush are popular among Americans.	If Everybody hates Donald Trump then why the hell is he up on the polls?

6556	A laugh track would be more fitting honestly.	LOL! So it's like the new Daily Show on Comedy Central, but with clapping added instead of a laugh track?
6557	Probably some time this week :)	Thank you! Any idea on an ETA?
6558	Not to be too pedantic, but they're not a government...	Well, it's certain that THIS Labour government can't capitalise on it. They have John McDonnell as their shadow chancellor, so their economic credibility is literally zero.
6559	I would imagine it to be more like Battle Against a True Hero	Pearl's Undertale theme would definitely be some variation of Spear of Justice.
6560	I've had Charlotte for 8 years, and it's always been that way.	Woah, it's adorable! I love it's name! Just to warn you, it's name ***will*** change over time no matter what. In the first 3-5 weeks, it will be called by its own name. Then in the next 2- 2 1/2 months, it's gonna be called by a variation of its name (Shreddie! Shred-Shred! Shreddykins! Shreddy-Sweetkins!). After this phase, it won't even have a set name. Just warning you.
6561	I would try if my fucking tablet can stop lagging.	Can we make h3h3productions animated a thing? (Like game grumps animated). We have so many talented artists in this sub. It's basically where you animate a segment of Ethan/Hila talking.
6562	Probably.	So, sans may know something about the resets... But does he know why kids love the delicious taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
6563	Yeah, damm computer science, i just wanted to make games	Jesus christ....
6564	He could be like Sproles if he was faster, quicker, more decisive, more elusive, and less fumble prone.	Hayne could be like Darren Sproles in Chip Kelly's offense. I think this is the best fit for him in the NFL.
6565	Yeah, because saying that you have to treat women like shit doesn't make you a misogynist.	are they gonna make an ad where he says mean things about men, and paint him as a misandrist ? didnt think so

6572	Hey Deb	Jesus cocksucking christ
6573	I sure as hell wouldn't.	The black kids don't look like they like this.
6574	I fear that they will kill trump if it looks like he's going to win and make it look like an accident or some "random guy".	Wrong! If Trump wins an extraordinary amount of monetary damage will result to all of the big corporations and Wall Street who fund both parties. There aren't really two parties, that's the point. Also other countries economies could fall as they have been propped up by our manufacturing jobs. The globalists who run the world would suffer greatly and lose their power.
6575	Yes, because having 1 gun better than it makes it garbage.	It's an up close gun, and the vector makes for a better up close gun. So yes it is
6576	Eraserhead is.......interesting.	Hmm. Thank you. This sounds like a good thing. I am far more excited about this film now. Your mention of Eraserhead is funny because it was the very film I was thinking of.

6582	Flames lost the trade, Hamilton is a busy	I just want to say that Dougie Hamilton has 37 points this year. And he's 22. I love this kid.
6583	disappointment	Marner finishes the OHL regular season with 116 points in 57 games. Bringing him to 301 points total after 3 seasons in the OHL, an average of 100 points each season. 2.04 points per game, an ever so slight upgrade over last years 2.0 per game. I don't know that you can improve much on a 2 point per game average, yes it seems like he made no statistical progress, but he also didn't regress at all. 2 points per game is no easy task, especially 2 seasons in a row. I haven't looked into it, but I'd bet money his primary point total is up significantly this year compared to last, his +/- is up as well.
6584	I'll try to find the link on here, but apparently Germany's debt to GDP ratio at the start of the war was about the same as the USA's *after* the war... Based on that, their seemingly impressive 1930s revival seems less so - the piece I read seemed to argue that it was a war of necessity as they'd spent so much they needed to plunder neighbouring nations to maintain what they were doing.	I think what they mean that Hitler was in fact quite a skilled orator and politician. He did essentially take Germany on a 180 after the Treaty of Paris...then totally fucked it up trying to invade Russia.

6590	Exporting terrorism is expensive, those mosque won't build themselves.	Saudis have cash reserves of $600 billion. The price of oil has crashed to $30 per barrel. Saudis are burning through their cash reserves, which would be depleted by 2020 at current oil prices and their spending levels. Russia is more resilient.

6602	r/me_irl	MRW I realize it's almost April Fool's Day
6603	You forgot about the 6.2% tax, and the increase for making 250k.	Not OP, but It depends on how much I'm making. $5000/yr under Bernie's plan means I'm making $250,000 as a single person (and paying $0 for insurance now). In that case, I'd like to think that I'd be absolutely ok sacrificing 2% of my income to be sure to provide some 29,000,000 people with insurance who don't have it, and lower the cost of insurance for 95% of the American population. A $5000 added cost is not going to affect me @ $250,000 nearly as much as the current $2000/yr cost is affecting someone making $30k/yr.
6604	All the big boys start with NOS, Meth injec., and a wicked loping cam.	Is there a recommended order for mods/upgrades/maintenance? Meaning, should upgrades proceed from minor to major, or is it the other way around? I know only the very basics about cars. So for instance, some people immediately go for turbos, while others start with small things like intakes. Also, everyone always talks about things like catback exhausts, suspension upgrades, and turbos, but what about little things like valve springs, brake lines, and throttle bodies? What things should be upgraded and in what order? Forgive me if the questions are a bit basic; I'm terrible at searching for answers in forums where I don't always understand the jargon. Also, please feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate subreddit. Thanks in advance!
6605	DESIGNATED E S I G N A T E D	Urgency to poop up to 3 to 5 times a day (not diarrhoea in most cases)...possible causes? Me: 22 yo, female, 165cm, 54kg, asian, this has been happening for a week now and current location India. Usually I go #2 maybe once or every second day (it's been like that my whole life) however this last week I've had sudden urges to poop frequently. The stomach pains feel like I have diarrhoea but in most cases it's just regular poop. I'd be on my computer, or outside feeling normal and then all of a sudden I would feel like I have explosive diarrhoea even though it's just regular poop. This happens maybe around 3 to 5 times a day. I know some people go #2 quite regularly but this is really abnormal for me, especially the urges to go which come unexpectedly. I've had a look at my poop and it seems like any regular poop. It does hurt my butt though every time I have to poop (and on a side note, I haven't had any anal intercourse if it helps). Afterwards I feel really tired and sometimes there's slight stomach pains. Will see a doctor this week but I'd really like to know what this could possibly be and if there's anything I can do to make it easier before my appointment. Thanks in advance for your replies!
6606	What, you don't like playing with invoker every single game?	Can you reduce the hero pool in Random Draft from 50 to 40? With the 50 heroes out of the 109, you're still able to spam the same hero for games on row. Reducing it to 40 seems like a good idea.

Sometimes when i realise that i might not have a full hour for a game I'll play against the AI but it is annoying that I can't pause an AI game. (obviously i don't expect a pause feature for pvp)

At first I thought there was something wrong with mine, but it seems like it happens on every report. Oh well... I suppose I shouldn't care about it too much. I just can't figure out why someone would.
6629	I'm so glad Greg was able to find someone to show his "wealth" off to, then.	I don't know if Penny is the force behind it, but she had some mental issues (bpd) that made it difficult to talk to her because she would become unstable. Greg is also a very "look at me" type of person and is the kind to show off our father's success as his own. He would often throw parties at our weekend home or vacation house without permission. He often acted out and was the epitome of "spoiled rotten brat". I'm not perfect by any means (everyone accuses me of being "the mean one"), but I would never do the things Greg did without asking/permission.

6631	Neighborhood markets ftw, most I ever had in any aisle was 3 half pallets of pet food that I slowly did over 7 hours lol.	Oh no, I had 8 pallets in Pets one night and had a shift manager who would constantly stop by every 15-30 minutes asking if I was done yet. I'm glad to hear my managers aren't the only ones like that.

They figured this out in wow a long time ago... "Even if you don't get the item you want, you still get valor/honor to buy gear later" but they seem to have forgotten that and have moved on to a "you must win most of the time or we aren't going to give you your quest rewards" mentality. Who wants to experiment if you can't do your quests at the same time?

Beardsley is a strange place but being 2 miles from my house is a big plus. I'm really starting to appreciate it.
6683	no shut up though im not 320 instantly.	Remember back when... * Legendary Engrams turned into Ascendant Mats or Blues * Rahool very rarely turned a Blue Engram into a Legendary * We were not guaranteed a Legendary item from packages * We'd have to pray that Variks was selling the Int/Dis item * We stood in front of a cave just to farm engrams * We essentially cheesed every strike with Gjarllarhorn * You had to rank up Eris to convert Radiant Mats * You couldn't upgrade weapons with Motes of Light * You'd kill Crota 3x a week and still not get a Crux * All you wanted was the Vex but it still never dropped * There were no Trials of Osiris bounties for easy loot * You had to play Crucible to buy Crucible gear * You couldn't rank up your factions with MoL/Heavy Ammo, etc * You'd do the Heavy Ammo glitch because Xur is an asshole Don't spout *'This game is getting too much of a grind'* nonsense when players right now have more for them than ever before. We've been through hard-times and right now I think we have it easy. RNG posts about not getting 320 light gear sound so very, very entitled when you look back at everything that has gone on previously. Remember the old days Guardians, things will improve. We've had hiccups and we'll have them again. It's our Destiny... If you can think of anything else that was 'grindy' in the past that's worse than right now, lemme know and I'll add it

6685	The problem is it seems just as likely, if not more likely, that these teenage edgelords will have their opinions validated through upvotes and praise from other teenage edgelords and/or adult bigots and wind up "cutting their teeth" and growing from teenage edginess to legitimate stormfront racism.	Because like it or not, these edgelord questions are how a lot of teenagers get exposed to this sort of thing. It's regrettable that there is so much blatant racism and sexism, but there has to be someplace for the teenage idiots to cut their teeth.

6701	Well hopefully it won't be until 2024, considering if either Bernie or Hillary gets in we'd want to see them get a full 8 years in.	O'Malley isn't a bad candidate. There just isn't any space in the field for him to occupy. He can't beat Hillary on electability, and he can't get to the left of Bernie. Fortunately, he's young enough to run again in 2020.

6713	That's why I chose blastoise over Charmander.	He's obviously lying, and I think you should send him off. If you let him stay, he will just take advantage of you and increase your insecurities. You should also really focus on your insecurities, because if you don't, any relationship you partake you in will be trouble. I don't think you are ready to date with these insecurities.

6719	Good job Trump, freeing us from the oppressive chains of political correctness!	Racist Creep So i live in a rural area of southern Indiana. I work in a town bar, and due to our proximity to Bloomington (where indiana University is) I would say that our population is a bit eclectic. Out in the sticks, it is very white, but its not a place where a lot of redneck stereotypes apply. Sure, some, but people will surprise you. Anyway, tonight, some guy starts using the N word at my bar. I here it from a few feet away, and quickly have to decide what to do. He is talking to some friends of his, and I basically just printed their check, figuring, Ill just move him along, and let him know i dont appreciate that language at my bar top. While printing the check, he goes on to use the word three more times! I walk up to him and say, "I cant have you using that word at the bar." He says, "Im talking to my friends," and basically is implying that I mind my own business. I reply, "I dont care, I cant have you saying that at the bar." He then gets angry and says, "Youre not the morality police." I quickly say, "Youre in a public place..." And before i can say anything else he just says, in a huff, "Fine! Goodnight! Goodnight! Goodnight!" basically yelling over me. He storms out. Anyway, it really pissed me off. I had heard from another bartender that the same thing happened to him a few days ago when only two people were at the bar at close. So i was anticipating the possibility of this. All in all, there is a creep in openly and overt racism. White people are feeling emboldened by trump, or so that is my theory any way. They want to start pushing the boundaries and they want to incite confrontations over their supposed rights to spew hate. I feel good that I didnt cower, and now I feel more confident dealing with this in the future. Its delicate being at work, but fuck it, im not worried about losing my job. I feel that the owners would support my choice to boot these people. Anyway, just figured Id share. I think there is a dark tide turning and i think we all need to be ahead of it, ready to confront it. Its not a fight we can lose.
6720	No problem, just add a little piece of paper stating for use with 3 watts or lower.	Lol, LDPE would melt all over the place from the heat. I'd pay good money to watch that happen.

6724	Yeah, definitely won't be happening unless they would trade strome for a defenseman(can see faulk or hanifin since CAR needs 1C)	That leaves them with Stone, Michalek, Dahlbeck, Elliot, Grossman, and Murphy. It's not pretty but it's not unmanageable. However, this is why I say it's hard to see it taking place. It's not really filling a hole that Arizona has (since Duclair and Domi are playing so well) but they'd also be getting a (as yet to be proven) generational player.
6725	Go charm your snake.	I once played SA-MP .. Me: I'm Anurag Other guy: That name sounds russian Me: No, I'm Indian. that guy: What? Indians have internet?? End of the story, never played any online game after that.

6730	He controls time!	What does Ekko have that makes him special? At the end of the day, I'm going to be an Ekko main, in any lane, because he's amazingly fun and my favourite champ. But that doesn't stop me from comparing him to other Champs and realizing he seems to fall behind. I jungle versus Gragas a lot. Why would someone ever pick Ekko over Gragas? To me, Gragas seems like a better Ekko. He's ap, good early ganks, he has effective mobility, he becomes tank with high base dmg, etc.. How about Lee Sin? They both excel early, transition into an off tank role, aim to kill squishies but basically just act as utility bots with some execute damage. If played flawlessly, they set up their team for victory, but it's unlikely to happen. Diana? AP Assassin who really get dive potential at 6, unloads a ton of damage, tank a bit, and get out while waiting for cooldown. I mean, I can see why you'd pick Ekko over Diana, this is kind of a stretch, but they still are similar, and outside of Ekko w, do the same thing when built similarly. So when would you pick Ekko over someone else? What makes Ekko good to have in a team over any other champion? I'm curious as to how you guys rate / feel about Ekko, perhaps it will give me some ideas on how I could change my playstyle.

6742	Because more oil=better lubrication duh	What? Why would you "decide to put 5 quarts in" when you already knew it needed less? Anyhow, look in the owners manual and it will tell you the capacity. But that number basically tells you how much oil to buy. When you change your oil you take what has drained into the pan (including what was in the filter) and pour it into something to measure it, like a gallon jug or something. Then you fill the filter with oil, and then fill the oil by putting whatever you took out back in. Then you check the level on the dipstick and add as needed until it is showing the proper level on the dipstick. Turn the car over, check again, and add as needed. As far as the light goes, you'll have to get that scanned. It could be because of the oil level, or it could not. You wont know til you scan it. Most auto parts stores will scan for free.

6746	"if(ThePlayerLeavesTheTemple){GoBackToTheTemple}" woah thats some advanced knowledge you have there	Wine of Zamorak Bots. So. I've ran out of membership, and could not get enough coins for an another bond. Got back to F2P, and decided to make money to go P2P again. Every1 knows, Wine of Zammy is a nice money making method on F2P. So tried it. Came to the temple, and realized, this place is overtaken by bots, and theres like no way to be faster than them. Unless you kill the Monks, and take the Wine instead of telegrabbing it. Since theyr using a script to get the Wine, you cant be faster. They are clicking instantly, theres no 200-300millisec reactiontime. Being a c++ programmer in my free time, i thought their script is poorly written, so i've tried to lure them away by dropping Wine all the way to the Black Knights Fortress, but sadly theres a protection in the code. Something like this: if(ThePlayerLeavesTheTemple){GoBackToTheTemple}. Theres no way to lure them away and get their law runes:/ Next thought: lets drop a Wine outside of the temple, right behind the table, and lets see what happens. The Bots (sadly not all of them) clicked on it, but whenever they've gone out of the temple they turned back to their spot. And noticed the Wine outside again, and basically they were just running out and in again and again giving me the chance to get the Wine on the table. So i've sacrificed 1 Wine for like 7. I think this is a nice method of busting the wine bots as well. Sry 4 my bad english:/

6768	LOL	I first tried psychedelics at 20, always had a great time. I would trip a few times a year on shrooms or acid, enjoyed both. At 26 I was having a go away party as I was moving back home after a few years in a different state. I picked up some good shrooms for all of us, and it looked to be a good time. About 20 minutes before I was set to head over, the kid in the apartment above me flooded his bathroom, causing gallons to pour through my ceiling, stressing me out. I thought about passing on the trip, but it was my last time I could do this with my friends down there, so I sucked it up. After we popped them, I had an amazing come up, which excited me as the last batch had been complete duds. We had an amazing time going around my buddies apartment complex, I'll never forget the light reflecting off their pond, or playing on the playground equipment, having it morph as I ran through it. We got back to his apartment, and for the first time ever, I was ready for my trip to be over before it was done. I started getting extremely uncomfortable. Time started looping, I swear I had the same trip to the bathroom 3 times. The last coherent memory I have is lying on a sleeping bag on the floor, thinking I had peed myself while my friends watched (which actually never happened). I woke up 3 days later in a hospital bed, with my family next to me. This scared me, as they all lived 3 states away. My chest hurt, and I had a scar on my left breast. I then noticed I couldn't move my legs. I thought I was tied up in blankets, so I reached down to pull them off. That's when I noticed I couldn't feel my hand on my leg. Apparently, deciding I wanted the trip over, I sent myself over the balcony of my friend's porch balcony, to end the trip like a dream to wake up. The problem was it wasn't a dream, and his porch was on the 3rd story. I broke a rib that punctured my left lung, which is what gave me the chest pain. I landed on my back, fracturing vertebrae from T6 down. When I woke, they had already opened my back from shoulder to butt, and stabilized it with rods. About a year and half later, my paralysis starts at the belly button, with some control till my knees, then nothing below that. I count myself lucky, I could be dead or unable to even type this. Please, if you decide to take a psychedelic, even if you're experienced, be safe. Make sure nothing is off with your set or setting, and that a sober friend is always present. It's not heroine or meth, but it's not also not just a joint.

6789	By 'dark' we mean 'gritty', of course...	The color scheming throughout this blitz trailer is different than the trailers before it. It is clearly superior in terms of color composition. Its far more visually stimulating than any of the trailers proceeding it. WB is reactionary, but I think David Ayer's vision for this was clear from the beginning. This is the film he wanted to make. I don't know what any of these people mean when they say 'dark'. What do you mean by it? BvS wasn't disliked because it was *'dark'* (whatever that actually means). It was disliked (myself included) because it was awfully made film. Plain and simple. And it did a huge disservice to the fanbase of the respective properties involved. 'dark' wasn't the issue, bad filmmaking was. Ayer has always made films to the effect of being grim, serious, mature and visceral and I don't see him suddenly changing up now that he's doing a project called Suicide Squad, he not only directed this film, but he also *wrote* it. If SS is good, itll be good because its good...not because it fits in this vague, loosely defined, popular film misnomer, that happens to be articulated as 'dark'.

I've been working 80 hour weeks since graduating and every inch of my body is aching for a little bit of relief and every inch of my kitty is aching to be filled :) Honestly what I want is someone to rub me down in a mixture of icyhot and bengay but I've heard it's super painful if you get it on your sensitive bits and menthol isn't the sexiest scent in the world so I'd settle for a good hard deep massage that ends between my legs. I'd be very grateful to you and eager to return the favor! I can't host and your picture gets mine. Also, if you're terrible at giving massages I'd be willing to coach you through it. Or we could skip the massage altogether and just have sex. I change my mind a lot so by the time you message me I could be looking to give road head or something equally random which is exciting so you should do it.

The Muslim invasion, having begun decades ago, is now in full swing and its demographic effects are irreversible in the current political climate. Within our lifetime (I'm in my early 30s), several European states will host either very large Muslim minorities or outright Muslim majorities. This won't go over painlessly. Their religious parties, already formed in many countries, will grow in membership and votes. Their gangs will start asserting more and more control. Their ethnic-religious neighborhoods will become more and more their own Sharia enclaves. At some point, they'll start massively impinging on YOUR liberties. Not in an abstract sense, but in a very real one. Women are already at risk of sexual molestation and rape for being white, Christian 'whores'. Men's turn will come in due time. We're all kaffirs to them, who must convert or be slaughtered. At best, they'll let us live if we abide by their laws and pay the infidel tax. In preparation for this moment, which is inevitably coming in the future, I've done the following over the past 6 months: - joined a gun club and got my license - purchased a nice (used, in very good condition, inspected by a buddy from the gun club) Remington 700 and ammo (up to the legal limit, sadly not very large in my country) - applied for the license to purchase a handgun for 'sporting' purposes ;) - gotten back into running seriously, now able to run a consistent 2 hours every other day - looked into joining a boxing/fighting gym (not really sure what to go for here, I want less "become OMG fuckamazing Rambo" and more "get used to full contact fighting and get a few decent basics") What have YOU done to prepare for when shit hits the fan and you're called upon to defend your life and freedom?
6816	Don't, the community was good without you reking everyone in melee	looks like ive got some blockhitting to do :)

6819	you forget this sir	speak for yourself bastard back in my days old people were hated by all this fucking new generation is so useless
6820	That's the one!	It's the Chase Plaza (But I think the name has changed recently.) Where the Cobb movie theater is located.
6821	No, all Americans are fat.	are all french air force pilots tiny manlets
6822	YEAH BUT SUBBAN	Cam Atkinson has just scored a hattrick
6823	When I spy on people I like to use the most suspicious and largest pieces of equipment to ensure they know I'm watching them.	I cant understand why it'd be necessary though? Production crew for what though? They filming a movie like Bowfinger?
6824	Wow you have some fake converses at least she has genuine ones	Matching with gf
6825	Mordekaiser	Who is left to rework after Taric and Yorick?
6826	but I hate vegetarians more than I hate killing, so I have to make this into something to be angry about.	Why does that matter when discussing a new technology that removes the need to kill chicks that just hatched? Who cares that some forms of death may be worse when you can simply avoid it? I agree that shredding them is not that bad of a solution; at least it's quick, but surely it's a preferable option just not having to kill them at all because you never allowed them to be born? That's a point that can be made completely independent of the relative cruelty of their death.
6827	Whatever, the real danger to the people is Uber.	Barber shop shooting gang related.
6828	Wow i should upload a Video of me killing all the Mongolz, CyberZen, MVP Karnal and more teams in Pugs, and scrims, that will show everyone HOW GOOD I AM	This guy killed summit1g and made an entire video about it (1:10)
6829	Production images are all we need duh	what about this movie looks horrible? we havent seen anything from it yet.
6830	Sure, Samsung never copied Apple and made billions of dollars though their own restless originality and innovation	Apple didn't invent the "rectangular cuboid with rounded corners" concept for a phone. However, they sued Samsung for billions and won due to a technicality. Like I said, I hate patent trolls, but I have no sympathy whatsoever for Apple in this case.
6831	But they *never* should!	Never is a strong word. Plenty of athletes (all olympic weightlifters) deadlift or do heavy pulls in lifters without injury. I agree though that for most wods with deadlifts lifters are probably going to be a bad idea.
6832	You were actually running imp parades all along	Been spending all my energy on it since it went to half off....I have yet to have a single elgif drop. Got about 9 imp artons and random imps
6833	that would be such a silly nerf, he already has health problems	Well he also has 2 aoe stuns, anyway, giving him a 300-600 base hp would probably help

6840	According to Snoop Dogs 'Doggystyle' album, it is in fact "doggy doggy doggy dog".	I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or if you actually didn't realize that I wrote both sayings incorrect on purpose... Its also "dog-eat-dog", not "doggy dog".

6843	He caught her pooping in the shower	People with agendas blow small things out of proportion to serve that agenda. As in, she didn't want him there, didn't do anything about it until it was too late, and she used the shower incident as a "last straw" type thing. Or she has some weird "I got diddled in the shower" or "i was douching my catholic vagina and nobody can know my dirty secret" problem going on. Probably both.

6847	Yeah but he didnt have to struggle at all, he got into Davidson because of his rich family.	Riiiiiight. Its not like Curry went to Duke or something. He went to Davidson, carried his team to relevancy and still got overlooked when it came time to get drafted. Then he faced injury after injury in his first few years in the league, and has now managed to not only overcome that, but transform himself into one of the best players in the league. You've got a real strange definition of what a struggle is. Curry has always put in the work.
6848	Remember #blacklivesmatter are the *real* racists.	I don't understand how people can be so cold and cruel. I mean she allegedly shoplifted, *so she deserved to die of dehydration*??
6849	And I'm sure all 65 are politely discussing the merits and shortcomings of these criticisms	And of course, the same article on rPolitics has 0 points but 65 comments. JFC.
6850	You must have shitty toilet paper ;)	Where I am the University only takes 8%, which is super cool.
6851	No, they are obviously poorly made pancakes, yet sell at a restaurant somehow	This kind of 0ancakes are made by whipping the egg white to stiff peaks and folding them in. The inside of this is closer to.something like and angel food cake
6852	It's not really like Sprint has much LTE to offer anyway...	Would have to be an industrial grade cellspot then not generally available to customers. Sprint only offers the Airave to customers and that femotcell is 3G only. In other words, as of right this minute, Sprint has no LTE femotcell device to offer.
6853	Good thing the soldier 725 yards away knew he was 100% factually a terrorist and not an innocent man, because only terrorists dig holes.	19 year old girl shoots terrorists ass out of his mouth!
6854	I think cloudflare are having issues because I just saw a cloudflare error on reddit.	yeah, shouldn't Cloudflare actually prevent these kinda things?!
6855	I'm not sure I agree but I'll give you an upvote for a damned decent argument (civilly made, that's a rarity on this site, hah) and actually having thought about the incident in question a bit before commenting.	I disagree. Offbeat until the truth gets out. One side claims deputies out of control, the Sheriff isn't claiming much, yet. But they say they have both dash cams and body cams, which have been turned over to the state police. Importantly, it was suggested that the deputies are locals, and understand ranching, which would make their behavior bizarre. Even the shooting doesn't make sense. The rancher was supposedly about to shoot his bull, when a deputy spun him around and shot him in the stomach. But *then* he was shot three or four times in the chest, which makes no sense as the normal response to being shot in the stomach is to double over.
6856	Ya because that is exactly how economic mobility works!	Silly socialists, poor people don't need food, they need freedom!
6857	And a noted anti-theist.	That's offensive. As if atheists go around killing people. Napoleon was a dick.
6858	You shouldn't take acid and try to be president at the same time.

6859	Quite an inspirational message: let's aspire to not have our faces disfigured from obesity.	That's the only thing Tess Holliday has going for her. Her face is still relatively normal for someone so morbidly obese.
6860	Well, we couldn't keep one character that was especially easy to win with...	Holy Mantle for The Lost? Are you serious? D4 and spectral tears was enough, why can't we keep at least one character that's especially difficult to win with?
6861	I think you forgot	Yeah, agreed. Honestly I think Miyazaki should put in a new weapon that kills all enemies in a level at once. That way people will have access to the "walking" playstyle
6862	He used to but I heard he was removed after the umpteenth time he tried raping someone.	Wait. He goes to our school? Please be lying...
6863	Apology accepted.	I'm sorry, I fail to take this tenuous stretch of any reasonable discussion seriously. Get back to me when you are finished making presumptive interpretations of fictional novels in order to build a criticism of some vague boogeyman in your head that has nothing whatsoever to do with the claims I'm making.
6864	yeah people are just fucking making up being raped left right and center	The real issue is that in a court of law you have to prove guilt not innocence. One persons testimony saying I went in a bathroom and asked for a condom but never consented isn't really a solid piece of evidence to convict someone. and it should be that way; could you imagine if people could be convicted solely on the testimony of the victim? people make shit up all the time.

6870	Its just a cultural difference	I think of all the cognitive dissonance that comes from the left, this is the most concerning. Subjugation of women, mistreatment of gays = bad. And yet still somehow, Islam = good? I can't even.
6871	Can't we just call them commies and be done with it?	PSA: The word is "censorial," not "censorious" Dear fellow shitlords, shitladies, and shitnobles who identify as gender-queer, "Censorious" means "severely critical." It's the adjective that goes with "censure," and nine out of ten times it isn't the word you're looking for. "Censorial," on the other hand, means "relating to a censor or censorship." Use that.
6872	But it's got an x86 processor so it must be easy, it's just like a PC...	You do realize their still isn't a proper working emulator for the original xbox right?
6873	But teh ad revenue!	Which further underscores how pointless video recipes are.
6874	Too easily exploitable...	I don't think games like this should result in ranking down. Amount of players should affect the weight of the game's ranking.

6883	Well it was fun for the 5 minutes I spent with him taking down the Deathclaw....	Same...
6884	The same way we enforce sex divisions in bathrooms now.	Uh huh. So how do you enforce this law? Ask every effeminate man or but manly lady to "show you thier papers"? your bigotry blinds you to the reality of the situation.

Automotive careers that actually make a decent amount of cash? What are some careers in the automotive field that make somewhere around 75k to 100k? Senior in high school trying to make some decisions
6905	Yore absolutely right, i misread.	Considering that the U.S. is one of the few countries that relies on tipping, it's probably fair to say it's based on black Americans, as the study isn't a cross-country analysis. Hence you cannot generalize it to race, but only blacks who were cultured in America. I mean, the frikkin' citation even *says* black **Americans**.

6916	With that metaphor, planning for metastasized cancer is planning for death.	If we stopped all human CO2 production tomorrow we'd still have climate change for atleast centuries. This is like treating cancer when you have symptoms. It's too late, the oceans are turning acidic and the tundra is decomposing. We need to *plan* for the change, not try to prevent it.

6935	Well, one of the reasom you do not pester people about having kids is thar you do not know if they had a miscarriage or have fertility issues and are hurting.	My opinion only matters when my uterus is needed Hi, new poster here, but definitely not new to justnomil behavior from my own mil. I've debated on posting before but never really thought was bad enough to warrant its own postings. Last night was just too much and I just need to vent. Context: DH and I have been together for almost 10 years, married for 3.5. SIL was pregnant at 20, baby is almost 3. DH and I are in our late 20s. More context, since this is my first post here, I have the type of mil where her son is amazing, can do no wrong but I am just kinda... There. Like, I could have invented the cure for cancer but somehow her son's breathing would still be more amazing than whatever I did. So, on to the vent. Last night was a family dinner for my FIL's birthday. So of course the whole "when are you going to have a baby" question pops up. I'm tired of this question. We decided to deflect by saying "You know, every time we're asked a baby question we delay trying for another year." MIL: "but I'm approaching 65 I want grandkids!" DH: "You already have one. I think at this point we're not going to try until we're 34." MIL: "You know, I've only been hearing from you, I haven't heard from bana" (shortening my username because she still hasn't learned how to say my full name either) Now, I'm already angry at this point because I was invisible during this whole dinner. But oh, they need me as a babymaker so suddenly my opinion matters. I manage to push a smile out and say "You heard DH. We're at 35 now." MIL: "But SIL's baby needs a cousin!" SIL: "yeah, tick tock, your biological clock is ticking!" That was the final straw that broke the camel's back. I just got up and left. I'm not even in my 30s, and even if I was, there is also nothing wrong with trying then. Sorry I didn't have a baby before I was old enough to drink, but when we can have a baby is between my husband, me, and maybe my OB. But somehow I was the rude one for getting up. Bonus context: I had a miscarriage a month ago. They didn't know, but DH decided to tell them afterwards. Response? "Oh if we had known we never would have said anything!" You know what? No. That just makes it worse. Instead of apologizing for being rude in the first place it's still somehow our fault for them being so damn rude. I told my DH I'm going super low/no contact. He understands. He's had a whole lifetime to get used to it, so it's easier for him to let that stuff go. I'm not limiting his contact, but he says I no longer have to go to family functions with his family if I don't want to. Hurray.
6936	SHOW ME THE RECEIPT	Does it matter?
6937	So you mean to tell me it's vaporware?	It won't. It will go into various betas and people will see it's not actually that useful or good so it will just continually be in more and more different types of beta never actually launching.
6938	Well so long as they are mounted in the centre of the ship, or at least on a flat surface, they should be right	How do you actually balance turrets? I'm sure most people have had the same experience with turrets. You get in, try to hit enemies by aiming with the added challenge of accounting for your ships movement, land a couple of hits amongst the chaos, but can't really feel your impact on the battle. Now the aiming probably cannot change much, and the obvious solution to me is to allow a better class of mount. I think that turrets would be plenty powerful currently if they had nearly the same accuracy as the pilot (who has gimballed weapons), but that is not the case at all. On the other hand, I'm not sure how powerful they should get either. Should a turret gunner be able to single handedly take down a target in a few shots like one in the Millenium Falcon (sidenote: I want that audio from TFA Falcon guns)? If so, wouldn't that make multi crew ships far more effective than fighters at every turn? I know something has to change, because as it stands, turrets are effectively holding cells for people that could be escorting.

6956	Didn't they show off Vagrant Story gear in the last live letter?	I wouldn't hold my breath for Vagrant Story gear, honestly. They've acknowledged requests for it, but they've also said that certain designs would be difficult to implement since they're fairly risque. I don't think it'd be impossible, since there's already a lot of revealing gear, but it didn't sound like it was a priority to them. That said? I'd be really happy if this turned out to be the case. I'd almost prefer it to be released as class-unrestricted glamour gear, though.

Not by any means tech savvy, so all these new GPU i hear about all sound arbitrary to me (i myself own a gtx 770). I was just wondering is 1080p starting to already become a thing of the past if it hasnt yet already? If it hasnt, when will 1440/4k become the new standard?

6962	God I love cats!	If I let my cat in the bathroom when I shower, he'll get between the clear plastic curtain liner and the curtain, on the edge of the tub, and just watch me. So usually I close him out of the bathroom, and he meows from the other side of the door. When I let him in once I'm done, he'll run in and look into the tub. It fascinates him.

6974	You forgot the	Don't let the liberal media tell you how to think and feel...
6975	If you're in a car downtown, you're a big part of the problem to begin with.	How about "No Right Turn on Red between 4 and 7 PM, M-F" ? One of the most aggravating things about driving downtown during the afternoon commute is having to brow beat "right turn on red" cars, to prevent them from cutting me off, while I'm doing my best to avoid "blocking the box". If you don't know what this is, it's where you're at a green light in heavy traffic, and you can't advance without stopping in the middle of the intersection. You're waiting for the cars ahead to move before proceeding through, but just as space opens up, something makes a free right hand turn and takes up the space. Worse yet, if you already started moving when they do this, you end up "blocking the box" yourself, a ticketable offense. This situation is both stressful and unnecessary. **I propose that there be a whole lot of signs that read "No Turn On Red between 4PM and 7PM, M-F" **. The time element is key, because most of these streets are wide open during non afternoon commute hours. In addition to solving the above problem, it's safer for pedestrians, for obvious reasons. I would even appreciate this as someone who needs to make a right turn, because then I don't have the pressure of cars behind me expecting me to take the free right so that they too can advance. If it's unlawful for me to take the free right, I get to sit back and relax until the light turns green. Good idea? Not good idea?
6976	What another intelligent response from you...	Ayy
6977	Everything you just said is 100% right (especially the blue worm shits) but i know this probably wont be fixed because we're just cranky and Edmund can do no wrong	Afterbirth Imbalances I just sort of want to rant about this as I've been thinking it more and more as I play the game I really enjoy the game, I'm so very close to 1001% completion (just 3 keeper things and items to find) but ever since Afterbirth came out I can't help but notice how poorly balanced some aspects of the game have become I'm going to start with something that is debatably down to personal opinion, but the blue worm spawners are just bullshit, they are incredibly tanky, the things they generate are incredibly tanky AND charge you down, they spawn them at the same rate the others spawn flies (an enemy that will take at most 2 hits to kil as opposed to like 7 or 8), they move about avoiding you and then when you finally kill it there's a very good chance 1 or 2 more of the blue things will spawn. Now you're in a room with 4 of them, they've all spawned one worm, this room will now take you around 48 tears (that land!) to clear assuming they don't spawn any more worms (which they will). Bad enough, right? Oh but wait, you're in one of those rooms that is just a square ring with 1 of them in each corner, the 2 on your side spawn 1 each which both them charge at you. Guess what! Literally nothing you can do! You can't run away because there's nowhere to run! Now they're both running into you, you're losing health, and you still can't do shit about it because the room hasn't magically changed, and now those bastards are shooting out more worms. I fucking hate them. Moving on, Krampus, he can now spin his lil brimstone bullshit, wonderful. This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that if he ends up against a wall, you can't fucking avoid it, he spins, you move with it, oh wait there's a wall in your way and now you've been hit by his laser, literally nothing you can do about it. The Forsaken who has this same function will move into the middle of the room before doing this so you can actually avoid it (unless you're in an L room which is another pile of bullshit) but this was clearly not actually given any thought with Krampus who someone just slapped the buff button on. Small rooms. Or thin rooms. Any room that funnels. Here's a boss that flings bombs that leave creep. Oh look he's spamming his creep explosion. You're now completely locked in and all it took was the first bomb! The second one just landed straight on you! Literally nothing you can do about it. Or here's 2 Monstros in the tiniest room, have fun. Now you're on the chest and you're in a corridor and here's 6 Monstros! They're all just hopping over to you so there's no room to dodge! All such fun! PHD! Basically useless. All those 'neutral' pills that are actually hugely detrimental don't get removed. Sure you don't get the stat downs, but when the alternative is a pill that means you can have both curse of the lost and curse of the maze on a giant dark room layout, I don't think that's smart. Sure, you can avoid it now (if you can remember the ??? doesn't mean you don't know what the pill is) but why is it still in the pool? Because there's no positive counterpart? Just fucking remove it! And oh, look, a pill that causes some people to feel nauseous playing the game, wonderful, I bet that was really planned out with beta testers. Hush. Cool boss design, everything about the fight is really well done, except the health. I understand the idea of the extra hard boss, the bullet hell style of fight, but 90% of the time it's a tedious slog, you can kill him, you know you can kill him, you can dodge the hits, it's just a matter of time, but the time is the issue because it's taking you 5 minutes to kill one thing. This is probably a preference issue but it's incredibly off putting, when you actively don't look forward to something in a game, and not because you're scared it'll kill you, that's likely not a good thing. Angel Rooms. When you have a room that requires some very, very specific criteria to be met to unlock it, you'd expect the contents of said room to be pretty good, right? 3 pennies. Holy Water. 4 spirit hearts behind 4 locks. I'm so glad I ignored Brimstone, Mom's Knife, and Incubus for this. When people will literally throw health away on a permanent level just to get precedent and never ever have to deal with this room, it's not that impressive. Oh I avoided taking any damage on this entire labyrinth floor that didn't drop any soul hearts, killed 2 bosses, and I get an Angel Room, I sure hope Sacred Heart or Godhead is in here! Nah, it's Holy Water. At least it's free! Oh wait I'm The Lost it's literally nothing. And now Devil Deals will never ever turn up again for some reason. (??????) You want to fight Mega Satan (so of course the path to do this gives you exclusively shit items and money) and you've managed to meet the criteria to unlock an Angel room, RNG was on your side and you feel like the completed key piece may eventually be yours, so you go into the room, and it's tiny, super Jesus spawns and proceeds to just buttfuck you into oblivion because he's kinda fast and there's nowhere to run. Somehow you come out on top with 1/2 a heart left and your key piece. Cue the rest of the run not giving you an Angel room because the arbitrary retarded rollercoaster that is the reasoning behind its generation decided you deserved nothing. Cheers game. Rag Man. Why is a boss who fires homing shots (of which the first shot of 4 I swear is a Sacred Heart homing shot) by the fucking dozen able to spawn these spiders that are considerably more tanky than your average spider? At least you can still hurt him while dealing with them temporarily, right? Wrong. He's just upped and decided to spawn 2 of them immediately for literally no reason, and now he's doing it again. Thanks buddy. Greed Mode. A fantastic mix up of the original formula, really love the mode and the idea of it. First floor, first wave, just black flies for like 3 spawns, easy! Not entirely sure why it's a wave but hey not complaining. Next wave, it's those bigger than the smaller spiders that spawn 2 spiders when they die, except there's like 6 of them. Next wave is the same thing, except you haven't dealt with the first ones. You've already been hit, you're Judas, there's nothing you can do except try fighting this ever growing horde of tanky bullshit. Super secret rooms. Why are there just spikes and literal shit in here? Were these rooms that could consist of nothing but hearts or pills that, as we've already discussed, will literally eat your face and cripple you, too good? Did they need to be nerfed? Rooms with fire or spikes right in front of you as you enter them. Why is that a good idea? Do you want people to slowly plod through the game by pausing as they enter each room? The fucking Boss Rush rooms with spikes around the items. Why are items constantly being put behind rocks and spikes? I have no health, or bombs, so now I just can't get an item. The rooms where it happens honestly look shoddy, like the game sort of bugged out for a second. With Boss Rush in particular, what's the fucking point? You already got there in 20 minutes, you met the fairly tight constraints to unlock the 'secret' and now you can't do anything with it. You get there as the Keeper? Enjoy not being able to get hit for the entire event. It's really like you're the original version The Lost! But worse somehow! The fact that some items completely fuck over others you pick up. It's got to the point where I will google item combos to make sure what I'm about to pick up doesn't break the game, and not in a good way. Ludo and Explosivo to name one, literally game losing the moment they collide. There's other shit but I've written a whole bunch of words that few are likely to read, I just wanted to rant because it irks me, the original seemed so much more balanced in comparison, this feels like they just threw shit at the wall to see what stuck and then kept the stuff that didn't stick in it anyway. I'm gonna keep playing the game, I still enjoy it, but it could be so much more. Also why are there no changelogs?

AC breaks not only the balance of this item but also the normally inherent counterplay possibilities against farmed carries (such as changing strategy or specific items).

So ain aircraft, composed significantly of aluminum (and also some steel), crashed into a building, composed significantly of steel (but I bet there wre aluminum cans in the building).

7094	I'm just saddened a bit that in the supposed haven of skeptics, there are so many people giving opinions without bothering to check the source material.	The OP is a karma eater and knew that pope and conservatives in the same headline would garnish that.
7095	This	This is a poor mindset in my opinion, you need to learn and practice being in a relationship just like anything else in life. Think of it this way, the mistakes you make and learn from previous dates/girlfriends will now no longer be made on your future wife when you start dating her. What if, in dating a girl, you learn about X the hard way and it ends your relationship. Well if you never did that, you might commit X on what would have been your future wife because you have no practice, therefore ending a relationship with someone you thought was "wife material." And not just mistakes, but you learn the mindsets or actions that make a great relationship. In dating your future wife, this may be the difference between her thinking you are "a nice guy" or "the one." You learned from previous relationships that X Y and Z can really make a woman happy, and now you can use those things you learned on this new "wifeable" girl. Do you think there are new things you could learn now that you are older? About mature relationships?

7097	So if I had a few anecdotal cases where someone personally did some dodgy tax maneuver should I conclude that everyone should personally pay more taxes?	Posts like this are exactly why corporate tax rates should be raised dramatically and dividend exemptions removed for small businesses.

7113	Gawd stop playing the victim	Lol Denver fans can't do anything right on r/nfl....when we boo him they get shit on, when we cheer him they get shit on. I don't understand why the Broncos are the most hated team in here but whatever I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I've watched plenty of games and I've seen almost every fan base boo their own team at one point or another but it only becomes an issue when Denver does it.
7114	Yes, the MRA is very racist when fighting for innocent black men who have been jailed.	Oh jeez, Gamedropping, accusing MRAs of being racist with zero evidence provided. Zero evidence provided that an MRA anywhere has even expressed any issue with T.F.A. Pure clickbait trash.

I can lie in a completely dark room all night and still stay awake. It isn't fun. I think ambien and lunesta are some of the worst drugs out there because they cause amnesia, so I skip on those. The ambien walrus is real. So much potential for abuse. If they work for you, great, but they are dangerous. I've taken to just meditating and lowering my vitals and hoping I might get a little bit of sleep in the process.

Like...sure it might be soft core (that's a thing that exists!) but it still is...the reason it is is because *thats how they're using it*. It's not like this is a whole bunch of people posting brands and prices and designers and their favorite looks like on mua or mfa. These are people getting off to photos of women in leotards. It's a porn sub.

7156	not models, probably just animation morphs, with the second morph just having a bigger butt.	I think it was because they had two separate models with and without the goggles and the one with them had a bigger butt. Also I'm pretty sure it's gone in the current build.

7170	uuuuuhm, only 25 :/ cmon guys, where is the rule of at least 400 kills in each SS?	Your airforce did great imo, we had 54 pilots so you guys were fighting and uneven fight from the start. I do want to share some of the things I've been working on over the year because I think miller air force has a better chance of using it then we ever did.

7172	Don't you mean Skyrim 2	Morrowind was my favorite Elder Scrolls game, and I loved the ability to do that. I had played Daggerfall like once or twice before Morrowind released, but I never got into it. I miss Telvani towers, where you were required to fly to get through. I miss being able to kill anyone, not just them falling over and regening their HP. I miss custom spells. I love the newer games, but I miss a lot of the features. Also, I miss spears. Maybe now they'll do them in ES6, since they've added stabbing animations in Fallout 4.

7175	What a racist post.	C'mon ladies it's 7am...
7176	Lol faggot	It also comes with baggage, a lot of baggage IME. Then there's the whole "I just don't care anymore" take on the whole issue. Which is kind of my take, TBH. I'd rather just beat it into a sock and get back to making beats. A GF, a wife, whatever - they're a friend first and foremost. A *best* friend. I mean, I gotta do my duties, hold it down when required, but I'd rather *be there* for someone than have sex with someone.
7177	This is gonna help unblacklist them for sure.	Kotaku Editor-in-Chief Stephen Totilo recently appeared on MSNBC to complain about being blacklisted by Bethesda and Ubisoft.
7178	It's not sexist or racist if it's against those filthy white men subhumans.	Sexist and racist, all wrapped up with a little Ghazi bow. And apparently thats meant to be what we do. Whodathunk it.

7181	The color teal	...huh?
7182	True, however, the example I gave is when the person refers to themselves first, which is never correct.	"Bill and me" can be valid depending on the context. "She spent the day with Bill and me." That's correct, because "She spent the day with me" is correct. "She spent the day with I" doesn't make sense, so "She spent the day with Bill and I" is incorrect.

7205	I doubt they felt "comfortable" taking that shot, it was just worth the risk.	I know there was two simultaneous shots but I couldn't tell which two officers did the shooting. I wonder this because the officer visibly closest to the camera seemed to be facing the highway and therefore dozens of people driving by. I'm more surprised they felt comfortable taking the shot in the direction of all those people than I am and a man standing still 10 feet away.
7206	That's what I'm talking about!	Do you know that state when you're comfortably drunk, but not too drunk? If I could stay like that for the entire time and play cards with my boys, sign me up, too.

7235	Note that I said "while at work".	And? There's a difference between likelihood and randomness. A low likelihood is having no cops die since the 70's Random would be if that one cop died because a plane fell out of the sky on him. It wouldn't be random if he died due to common hazards and dangers that are part of the job of being a cop, such as being shot.
7236	This whole trickle down system is working great.	And it's totally not because many small business owners count as millionaires even if they reinvest most of the earnings back into their business, and this group with the petition are maybe trying to force out competition, or anything.

7239	What are the specs on your PC?	How much more optimization is still to be done on UT4? Hey guys. I've been playing UT since I was a little kid, I remember playing my Dad's copy of Unreal Gold when I was 5-6 years old. I never played anything since UT99 and I am LOVING UT4. Only problem is I get very little FPS. I'm not sure how to check but it feels like 30-40 fps. Is this because UT4 is very optimized at the moment or is it because my PC sucks? Even on lowest settings it feels hardly playable. TLDR: Am I going to get better framerate when UT4 is properly finished or will I need a better PC? Any tips for FPS increase would be awesome.

However, years later, rooting it is almost a requirement for my needs. Unfortunately as most of you already know, this is probably the worst phone to root. I've Googled and Googled and Googled and tried a few things (including Towelroot) with no avail. I'm willing to do anything just to get this damn thing rooted, so please someone help me. Point me in the right direction. Right now it is running 5.1.1, but I don't mind wiping if need be, and I definitely don't care about warranty.
7244	That's an amazing mental image.	Oh man. Creepiest guy I ever met was gorgeous.

7251	This escalated quickly.	My friend's rabbit enjoying a Sunday bath.
7252	Warner Brothers is making Ubisoft look downright saintly right now.	Mortal Kombat XL and Kombat Pack 2 will only be available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
7253	So glad they got the eyes right.	Bananas in Pyjamas made it onto Robot Chicken this week....
7254	Just super score it	God fucking damnit he was one stat away from a 5x5 against Denver AGAIN!. He was one assist away last season. I just wan't him to get it so badly. lol
7255	Then why are we still playing Runescape?	Runescape 2 was released on this day in 2004
7256	Upvote for Little Britain one of my favourites.	Overhearing people in work talking about the new diet they're trying always reminds me of this.
7257	Please, don't just send a youtube link instead.	LPT Request: How to make a GIF that doesn't look terrible or take forever to load. Like the title says, I want to know how to make high quality gifs that dont take 2 minutes to load on high speed internet. What's the secret?
7258	In the cooler	What ice?
7259	Tumblr, even though it's literally the same kinds of people.	What does Reddit hate the most?
7260	So easy to confuse Madagascar for Sri Lanka :(	Geography is tough
7261	Probably why those Stacy sluts won't sleep with me!	Guess men have been obsolete since the first vibrator was invented, with that line of thinking.
7262	well that sounds like fun !	Making it in Unreal: LIFE is a survival sim not about destroying nature but communing with it
7263	That sounds like a fantastic book for children.	In about the 8th grade we had to read a book called The Red Pony Horrible book; the kid gets the pony he always wanted, horse gets out due to kids failure to close the barn door, horse gets sick and dies, then the kids father skins the pony and leaves the body where the kid can see it
7264	Dont forget the "sexy" Twi'lek in the reworked version of jabbas palace.	What I've noticed is that a SW creature is never cute and rarely even good-looking. Most SW creatures are really ugly. They are usually a cross between different earth animals with a hint of "speculative evolution", to make them look believable. That's actually the reason so many people had problems with the rathars - they look *too* alien.
7265	I don't think dogs have muscles there capable of moving their ears like that, if they could they'd all be flying instead of walking.	I think you're right. I kept looking at it, wondering how the heck do you train a dog to do that! But after looking at it again, it appears the folds in its neck are being pulled from behind.
7266	HE PROMISED HE WOULDN'T DO THAT!	inb4 hillary supporters going crazy "OMG HE MENTIONED CLINTON NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN"
7267	But why would he dole out an unfinished person to the people who payed for it on his website?	I believe in an article I read or a Tidal email perhaps it said that the album would be updated and changed several times in the coming months or something along those lines...
7268	Happened at DreamHack London last September, Saturdays final match started at like 11:50 and at midnight they had to ask all the spectators to leave as the arena was shutting for the night to clean and what not.	Na'vi vs. TQM ending without the crowd? Smix just said on stream the fans had to leave because of a curfew. So there we're no fans to witness the comeback I think. What's the deal with this?
7269	How is this creepy.. this sub is run by a bunch of pansies if this is considered creepy.	Transgender former banker, 55, has her ears and nose REMOVED to transform into a 'dragon lady' with scales, a forked tongue and a horned skull
7270	Yeah but we should all be traipsing off down to subway every lunch time!	People gotta eat.
7271	Hey man its not a big deal, its not like people could die from these mixups	But they did it not once, but twice.
7272	Then you shouldn't have been born poor then!	Because people that don't have the money for healthcare shouldn't just be left to die.
7273	Vapor lock	Lisa needs braces!
7274	I want to put Janet Yellen on the 20$, I want to see her announce that with a straight face.	I wanna put Obama on the penny. That way we can remember him as a pointless and costing more than value provided.
7275	But nobody should need more than 64kb of ram!	#if FP_W_TYPE_SIZE &lt; 32 #error "Here's a nickel, kid. Go buy yourself a real computer." #endif
7276	You're right the dude begging on the corner prob has a way nicer life than you..... I mean nobody would ever donate food or clothes to these people right?	Happens a lot around here. I always comment what nice designer shoes they have whilst my boots have holes in them.
7277	Awww poor Americans, I feel so bad for you.	People just love to hate Americans.....
7278	It means it has a higher pixel ratio to screen count	'regular size screen' what is taht supposed to mean?
7279	Yeah right...	Nothing to make a big fuss about, if you ask me.
7280	His voice got loud, what a jerk	Players have bad days. When we were at Ole Miss, Moody (I think Moody) got in a fight with a guy. I thought he was a total ass but he's been a class act every Ole Miss game I've caught since. That said...the yelling isn't a bad thing lol. have you seen who our coach is? you gotta expect that playing us.
7281	Maybe we should discontinue this #RefuBee program, look what it gets us.	This guy has been taunting Goons in Saranen. Goons aren't the only ass-hats. (Psychotic Tendencies)
7282	Yes, same way that skyrim is a terrible game with no depth	does every mention of fallout 4 have to deviate into this?
7283	change... where have I heard that before?	The editors always have the final say in this the poll is just to gauge public opinion. Bernie can win it if he actually makes the changes he's promising then he will be worthy of it
7284	Millions more people like her over the opponent?	Can you tell me why?
7285	There's that damn male privilege again!	He lives in Utah. It's not going to happen unless the mom chooses it.
7286	How'd they all line up in the hallway like that without being made aware of one another?	Got 17 problems
7287	wow not even lv 7 explorer nub af	The moment when you realize you have a problem
7288	Rob looks like a party version of Rex, he's prob got a joint stashed in the car, and his favorite word is dude.	Rob Ryan fired
7289	Currently, yes.	Are the skins playing their starters?
7290	*Tennessee vs Northwestern - Outback Bowl* Rank: 37/40 When will Tennessee get the respect we deserve!	Ranking all 40 college football bowl games for 2015-16: From worst to best
7291	Is it ever?	Thought you were talking about a different part. Today is definitely not my day to shine.
7292	But we need a,b and c to win	And it should be one of the weekly bounties so it can be something like "Get 200 kills while controlling only 2 zones"
7293	Yeah it's definitely a gamble but there really isn't any cheaper elite players you could use so for those that like to do them its a good deal!	3k plus the Elite badge at 18-20k, you're probably losing coin. I've done 3 of them for some redundant SS that I had and everything I got was crap. Base Forte, Base Wilfork, and Base Jurrell Casey. Should have just kept the SS and sold the elite badges.
7294	*GASP* You didn't mention how the refs literally killed our family and burned our house down.	No it doesn't... because it was more than just being beat by quality teams... it was bad coaching, and play calling
7295	inb4?	And before FaZe Clan picks them up
7296	This actually explains a lot	Georgia players excited they no longer have to eat hot dog buffet, typically prepared by Kathy Richt before the big games
7297	True, he said on stream that he doesnt have it on but liquidpedia says 3/1.05 so i think he changes it alot.	Swag changes his settings a lot, it's impossible to know if he has it on or not
7298	Too bad they usually tack it on at the end, so I get to enjoy it while I'm sleeping, :D	theyll usually extend your booster
7299	Only brown rapists though, white rapists are all falsely accused.	Rapists are a bit worse
7300	hey calm down he is global elite his flair says so	Meh
7301	How can I make my bloody nose in the car without tissues into a badass story that will get me hella pussy	Facebook friend saves man's life and shows the bloody aftermath!
7302	Sums up all of reddit right there ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
7303	Voice comm issues have nothing to do with NA's problems.	That has absolutely nothing to do with it....
7304	Cmon, I mean I see them jump the tracks into the traffic lanes all the time	Are you really saying that these accidents are the trains fault?
7305	I should be global, shit tier teammates keeping me down!	inb4 everyone puts Global backround
7306	You must be a really good friend to have.	Stop being such a pussy and just move on.
7307	If you're moving during click, it takes it as drag... So either drag as another comment suggested, or ease up on the coffee... There's no setting I know of to change this behavior.	Could SW stop finishing (second LMB click) instead of me? On this gif I pressed LMB only once
7308	Better yet, don't play	Or, way easier and better, start your own invite-only session.
7309	Well, considering they made the mode "free", I guess it's intentional, I hope not though.	**Yes, you can't use Swann, Zagara or Vorazun when using spawning.**
7310	Jesus Christ why were you watching bestiality as a child?	Fucking Bambi.
7311	North Korea	What people or country do you totally not understand and want someone to explain?
7312	pleb can't even keep a constant 30fps	This guys airsoft channel is fantastic, I might have another expensive hobby now
7313	The human eye can only see 30fps so of course light travels slow by logic duh	Light doesn't travel that slow.
7314	My flair is offended.	Quality Sanders is a dirty shekel hunter joke.
7315	I actually prefer "Hildebeast".	I don't get the term Hilladawg. Dawg=dog. Dogs are loyal. Hillary is a warhawk. Hillahawk is a more appropriate term.
7316	See, Brady is too cocky and arrogant	Tom Brady says he's not one of the all-time great QBs. Do you guys agree?!
7317	Irregardless	What is a word not conventionally used in daily life that you love to say?
7318	Sexist remarks will not be tolerated.	Am I the only one here who can't **stand** listening to Hillary's fucking **screechy voice**?!?! God damn she sounds like a raving lunatic banshee.
7319	it also gives you 1 second of cc immunity with the stun so he would waste ult	Good ao kuang players will ult u while you're about to be at threshold then their 2 hits you, proccing the stun, but they'll be cc immune.
7320	Not enough scoring... A 21-14 football game is such higher scoring and will be more exciting	How can such a fun game be ranked so low?
7321	Nice sentiment, but what if people are going to downvote my critism because they think I also downvoted?	If you downvote a post... ... would you kindly comment on the post to let me know how you think I need to improve my writing? You've already gone through the trouble of finding a workaround, so I would appreciate the feedback/critique. Thanks in advance!
7322	For a cinematic experience.	Pff. I can run it with my i3-4160 and GTX 750 Ti. Although at 24 fps.
7323	Oh joy, they let your racist ass back out of the mental institution.	Eat shit, you statist pig-fuck.
7324	but have u peeped my soundcloud	but are u a rapper
7325	Maybe the entire ice surface and arena seats except for Z shifted down about a foot.	So what's the excuse for leaving his feet? Not sure how Pageau ends up with a bloody nose if the hit was clean.
7326	Don't you love driving in the fog?	Good morning from the beautiful North West brothers and sisters. Stay safe out there.
7327	That the National Media does not have any topic to talk about us with now that Matt "Uber Driver" Stainbrook has graduated.	What has you most concerned about your team this season?
7328	he also spent first round picks on Knowshow Moreno &amp; Robert Ayers.	Yep. He also drafted Demaryius Thomas, Eric Decker, Von Miller, Julius Thomas, Chris Harris...From 2010-2012 he drafted 14 starters and 5 pro bowlers. He was largely successful in Denver. I wouldn't be opposed to him.
7329	Edgy	Fuck off. Form your own opinion.
7330	Obviously using the multishines to reset the staleness on the blaster	"Okay well laser into multishine...that's an edgeguard."
7331	Checking in, this happened to me exactly back at release as well, wanting to move the Wolves to LV.	This was me last night! Ended up giving up and using preset shit.
7332	I knew that I could find all the right answers in 'The Anti-Empire Report'	Myth and denial in the war against terrorism: just why do terrorists terrorize?
7333	Or DIY pharmacies	Also take in to account that antibiotics aren't big money makers. It takes 10 years and a billion dollars to come to market with a new one and it usually doesn't make it's money back. Once dieing of bacterial infection become a large threat again, drug companies will be able to be profitable from antibiotics again. Or maybe we will nationalize pharmaceuticals. Who knows.
7334	LPT: Got OCD, shoot yourself to fix it.	TIL in 1988 a man with severe OCD shot himself in an attempt to commit suicide. instead of ending his life the bullet damaged the part of his brain that was responsible for his OCD. He later went on to become a straight-A college student without any harmful long lasting damage.
7335	Create a registry, maybe give them all tattoos so we know who they are and for our safety.	The fact that he has to remind them of this is frightening. What were they gonna do anyway, stick them in refugee camps, throw up some barbed wire, and add some guards?
7336	omg I tested positive ;-(	Are you a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders? Take the quiz.
7337	More like clg is the red-headed distant cousin...	sisters?
7338	So shulk is a female and from a 1st party nintendo game now?	Uh... What?
7339	Not firing a coach who doesn't have a single play in his book and is running Kelly Bass and Nance Bass back courts in close games is definitely trying to win now	yall are tryin to win now and can't even win lol ...6 MAN LIKE LOU WILL
7340	This is better though because it's not Islamic.	So like sharia law?
7341	wow, such disrespect for Chef Voyardee!	I don't know if they have enough talent to get one of the top 3 spots but he is playing amazing. Their front court depth is simply horrendous.
7342	I get what your saying, but I think it'd be pretty inefficient to use cargo planes to give them the missiles, they're pretty big, and that would cost a lot of jet fuel.	We should still send the missiles to Saudi Arabia, but not by boat, truck, or train. Send them through the air. We'll stop sending missiles when they decide to create a justice system that is not barbaric like that of ISIS.
7343	seems a lot went with the low int build	How do people see this whole screen and never try to click down to even look at what else is on the other rows? Took me about 5 seconds to realize how this worked.
7344	haha glhf :)	Thanks mate. This is my new background! I just have to figure out how to get Pandora to work with it...
7345	Oklahoma City was an anti-government white guy, numb nuts.	They can attack anywhere. They want people to feel unsafe. Like Oklahoma City. Like fort hood. Like boston.
7346	Is there any chance that more people will be invited to the PTU before it gets pushed to live?	PTU 2.0 Update for Dec 3 2015
7347	Being in the majority doesn't give license to talk about others that way.	63.8% of worldwide christians are not "sola Scriptura" Protestants. Thats a supermajority in terms of the Senate.
7348	Time for Patterson to step up!	Ugh. He was bad, but whoever takes his place will be worse. I thought our passing offense couldn't get any worse than last year, with an o-line that allowed more pressure than anyone and a bottom-five WR corps. Turns out, it can get worse.
7349	Good for more than doing better than the Muslims who so miserly donated to little	Anheuser-Busch donates truck-load of canned water to the residents of Flint. In all, they have donated more than 74 million cans of emergency drinking water to disaster stricken areas since 1988.
7350	If you're looking for the serious, supervillain Lex, it was disappointing, but if you look at him like the mad scientist he is, it's pretty great.	Really? Did you like Eisenberg as Lex too? Legitimately asking since I thought he was awful.
7351	Tree taming	What did you major in?
7352	Ok, I understand that part, but I would try to get it working without the *switcher* as that could be where the problems are and not the sdk itself..	I believe this is the purpose of the switcherV3. Win10 is significantly different where likely win8 works. And, am trying to get anything working.
7353	Dont you have better things to do with your life?	So comfort is the entire reason you live a delusion?
7354	Not to mention the CBR125 isn't winning any speed awards, so why is he watching a top speed video haha	Today I found out how to remotely control my high school student's computers and how to send them messages when they're not doing the right thing
7355	He looks like a very young Val Kilmer.	Who is this boy from the trailer?
7356	Impressively brutal.	your rat is sad you're too short for the fall from your shoulder to be fatal
7357	And they say chivalry is dead :^)	Let's not forget what Trump supporters look and sound like.
7358	Whatever his faults are, I definitely agree that Kimi Raikkonen's been a really really unlucky driver in his F1 career.	Bullshit. Kimi has been one of the luckiest drivers in the history of the sport. he's consistently found himself in top machinery despite rarely showing he deserves it.
7359	Yep that's it.	More importantely, he got praise and support in way most redditors wouldn't, therefore the hivermind dictates that he must be shit on. Oh, and he is a brown muslim kid, go figure.
7360	What if you find a cheaper similar product made elsewhere?	Me too. I'd definitely like to support them by ordering those products.
7361	I'm answering your question and I'm a man...	What small act of rebellion or mischief have you committed recently? .
7362	Talk about "gallows humor".	Charlie Hebdo back in good form, and attracts "outrage" once again.
7363	misery loves company	Why are people who want kids so adamant about forcing everyone else on Earth to have kids?
7364	ZENZI IS LOVE, ZENZI IS LIFE ZENZI IS LOVE, ZENZI IS LIFE ZENZI IS LOVE, ZENZI IS LIFE ayy lmao	A few days ago, my grandmother called, saying that "Zenzi emailed her", and she has already taken action. She wanted me to check that she did it right.
7365	I figured it was the wrong kind of killing	Really? I hardly find this funny at all.
7366	thanks i need to find the issue so i am not on the news as Houston make blows up his neighborhood with e cig lol	Cell wrapper may be absorbing torque an not actually pulling cell down. If you dropped it, that could do it, as bottom is sprung, not top. It'd allow cell to compact spring an thrust cell back into upper contact that is not sprung, dent.
7367	Path of Radiance is easier	I recommend going back further and enjoying the fun of sacred stone and how easy it is
7368	You know, cause criminals might come by.	Police to Enter Private Unlocked Vehicles and Take Valuables To Remind Locals to Lock Up
7369	You're just mad because we are a REAL organization that is ran PROPERLY	Most of what she says it's straight up bull shit. Some of it even fabricated
7370	No unique passives/items = 6 death bringer/3 titans banes ect :3	How would YOU break the game? Okay, the rules are simple: Comment how you would break the game in a swift simple motion! For example: Make every ult usable in base at lvl 1, add a 4th lane, or make buffs stack again! Be creative, and no change is stupid!...or every change is stupid, but that is the point!
7371	All Christians need to say they don't agree with this man!	Another peaceful, reformed Christian?
7372	That's reality television though, I'm mainly talking about real life where crappy auditions are considered a waste of time, not good television	Yea, but then it wouldn't sell if you don't have a good miserable fail. But you're right, I haven't done any musical stuff since college. I just like seeing a good trainwreck. And if I'm forced to watch some godawful reality tv garbage. I want to see something bloody. So. Let there be Take on Me. Let there be Unchained Melody. Let there be Barracuda. Let there be Dream On. Let there be Queen of the Night Aria. Set the game to *"Hard Mode"*.
7373	This is worth....ONE QUARTER PANTS!	Star Wars: The Pants Awaken Back in Internet 1.0 there was a funny, silly thing where you would take a word from a Star Wars quote and replace that word with "Pants." Seems pretty strange at first until you get into it and you get quotes like: * "I find your lack of pants disturbing." - Vader * "Love won't save you Padme. Only my new pants can do that." - Vader * "I will not fight you father." - Luke "You are unwise to lower your pants!" - Vader I always enjoyed this trend so I thought it'd be great to see it applied to **The Force Awakens** (tag spoilers). Post your pants quotes below from any Star Wars movie!
7374	Texas City **is** a chemical leak.	What a shithole
7375	Mr Garrison fucked Trump to death.	Trump would fuck Bernie to death
7376	2 rules Never feed it after midnight Never allow it to get wet.	Tiny little floof.
7377	Yes AFAIK every USL league match can be seen on YouTube.	YouTube?! Oh so they're free then? Sweet!
7378	Because it is now released as a Backward Compatible game and it was free with GwG quite some time ago.	Not to question a good thing, but... Why?
7379	That fucking screenshake, holy shit.	What if "Adventure Time" was a 3D Anime Game (Public Beta Demo)
7380	i'm talking about the future ones as well, because i don't want to open my level 60 one right now, I want to know what comes after	If you hover over it you should be able to see. I know it gives mesos for sure and maybe armor for that level?
7381	Should have just self-diagnosed in the cradle, then I would have been a True Autist^TM.	"Obviously you're a stereotype if you got diagnosed!!!!" Haha OK buddy
7382	Hush	So I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but looking it up online hasn't worked for me. What exactly is Hush supposed to be? There are bosses like Fistula and Polycephalus that represent some sort of condition or ailment, but i can't seem to find something related to the Hush. Nor can i find anything similar to him in religious text. Anyone have any idea just what he is supposed to represent/be?
7383	Step 1: cut a hole in your gold record.	Major Dudes of Steely Dan
7384	Wouldn't make my life SO MUCH BETTER, but it would make my life a little easier.	That life would be SO MUCH better if I made $5/more dollars an hour. It's not much but it's enough.
7385	"Unseen force"	Is it just me or does Jim use the word "basso" a lot?
7386	Technically they do, but you can *really* notice it when tripping on psilocybin mushrooms :)	what if mirrors had video lag
7387	Or giving season ticket holders train tickets.	The seven figure marketing budget should just be spent bribing the LIRR for more trains.
7388	Or that people don't really have a reason to say anything but nice things to someone who suffered such a tragic story.	Seems like Chyna was nice to everyone in the business, no one has anything bad to say about her. Really sad.
7389	Figured, but Portage Place isn't much of a mall.....	Not even expresspost? That was supposed to say mall.
7390	[Arc Greater Twin Cities](http://www.arcsvaluevillage.org) is a pretty good charity and they have some thrift stores scattered throughout the metro area.	Best place to donate clothes and household goods? Title says it all. I'm moving in a couple weeks and would rather donate the stuff being left behind by roommates and the stuff I no longer use either. Seems much better than just chucking it all the garbage. I'm looking for suggestions since I've heard some stories about places like Goodwill actually having rather strict acceptance policies.
7391	Now I'm curious how high the stack of bread that's been through my toaster is...	Went to buy a toaster but I don't think I eat enough bread.
7392	He slid deep into her ~~flamingos~~ flamoes.	In Dutch, and especially Flemish, plenty of words exist. My favorite must be Flamous/Flamoes.
7393	Delhi girls are still at large	When will you guys learn, the north Indian platoon is for the feral females problem.
7394	I guess when Kasick decides to attack.	You have to wonder if/when the Don will stump him.
7395	Decimation continues	Broncos have 58 players under contract, the second-fewest in the NFL. (Atlanta has the fewest: 54.)
7396	God bless our democracy	Thanks, just looking it up now. Apparently the libertarian party made a push for 5% in 2012 and failed. 5% is the threshold to receive public financing, and they receive it proportionally after that. Ballot access looks like a damn mess.
7397	Obviously he's very self-conscious and saw what we were saying about him here.	Has the "Sekera can't shoot" circlejerk ended already? Didn't last very long..
7398	And now we don't have George to fix the movies after!	Supposedly they were rushed in creating him, but that doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you consider that leaving him in the shadows would have been more mysterious and intimidating while also letting them wait until the next movie to finalize a design.
7399	a gel that provides nutrients.	What is the clear substance through which they are burrowing?
7400	I've tried four different models from three different companies, every single time the second one would start letting off a sound like grinding metal and shrieking emus, emit a shower of sparks, and die.	Might i recommend the three sea shells then?
7401	I don't like it...personally...	Cadance and Shining Armor's Foal Name Revealed
7402	This subreddit has fucked up my browser history real good.	Found this EPIC meme
7403	well, their website shows a Surface Book prominently displayed, so maybe go with that.	Looking for a Windows tablet that can run Bitwig studio. So Bitwig Studio (a music making software) released a tablet version a while ago. After watching some guys use it on cheap 8 inch tablet, I really wonna get into potable music making, but as a student I don't have the money to splash out on a Surface Pro that they use in all the promo videos. So I'm looking for a tablet with at least these specs: * Windows 7 or up * Dual-core AMD or Intel CPU or faster with SSE3 support * Minimum 1280 x 768 pixel screen resolution. * Minimum 2GB RAM. * Minimum 5GB free disk space. * Decent internet connection to download bundled content (not included with installer). Now I'll definitely be getting it used, because then I have a *chance* of getting 10+ inch something or other. What ones would you recommend?
7404	::Hugs Tight:: Hang in there Sill.	Shit hit the fan Monday. Brother decided to confront me about my lack of a job and instead of being supportive or at least trying to determine why I quit, he just did what he always does and yelled, blaming me, saying that I was cowardly for quitting and that I should have just "manned up" and dealt with my issues and that working is the real world and so on. He has the conservative attitude that if you acknowledge any problem that you have you are just trying to blame your failures on that problem and that you should just "deal with it", which is strange because "dealing with it" is the whole reason that I quit so that I could get a job where I was out as trans, but he doesn't give a shit. Apparently he is engaged but God knows he didn't tell me nor my parents. I only found out because he was talking about how he had his *own* life apart from my parents and that he wanted me to take over helping our parents financially. He couched it in terms that he cared for them, but to be honest that is bullshit. If he cared he would have told them he was getting married. Whatever. I am applying for at least three jobs a day, more if I can. It is destroying me because the stress from applying is just too much but what can I do? I have been majorly depressed all week now. Am thinking about going to a therapist if my depression continues. It has never been this bad. But I know that I won't get any support from my brother--he will probably just say that I am using it as an excuse. Got really drunk Monday night--wonder why?--and was throwing up all day Tuesday. Better now. Had a dream last night where I was raped. Because that is what I need right now. Feelings about this girl I have been talking to are completely fucked up right now.
7405	get downvoted for making a joke pleb.	But the right's still good, right?
7406	Yeah you're so cool now that you bought a video game, brah.	Am I cool yet? (Found in the wild, for $150 :/)
7407	Welcome back, everyone, for tonight's edition of *Are you a sociopath*?	Serious question here. What emotion is conveyed by her face? I'm having a very tough time figuring it out. Seems to change depending on the words.
7408	TURBOSWEAT TIME	I should probably wait for more people to get the patch...
7409	Actually, majority of patches and content we've gotten is slightly leaning in Arena's favor.	It needs to be worked on without a doubt. I can't play Halo for too long without my whole Fireteam loosing connection at the end-game cutscene and one of us taking a ban. It is so annoying. Yeah maybe they should take it out of FFA, but before they do that they need to fix the disconnecting at the *END* of a game and taking a ban for it. To be fair though, even though I sort of agree with you on no FFA bans, because you are not letting down 3 other people that then have to carry your weight, but let's be honest, 343i would rather make more War zone maps then even agknowledge their Arena players.
7410	Surely the solution is to let more of them in!	Think about what they want to achieve with these attacks. They want the western world to hate peaceful muslims in the hopes that they will join the Daesh ranks. Don't fuel hate unless you wanna see more shit like this on a fucking ridiculous scale.

7412	Link pls	And thank *you* for sharing your experience with us! The video of your dad trying out Apollo 11 is, to this day, one of my favorite VR related videos on YouTube
7413	So 46.6% of users are liars?	Behold the PCMR general survey ! Over 3,000 participants here are the results !
7414	Shut it down, the internet is over guys.	Leo gets the Oscar!
7415	You dropped this	That would be awesome. They could make up for abandoning their entire source of income by the volume that would sell.
7416	You know.... Witch Time.	What do you think induces the most salt? Running into fully charged smash attacks because of lag takes the cake for me.
7417	If you see them around town, give the kid a bunch of sugar.	How a wild mombie cost me a job (On mobile, sorry if the formatting is wrong!) This happened some time ago. I decided to be a carer/personal assistant to a lady on a wheelchair. She needed help with basically everything on daily basis, so during my first shift I was meant to spend a whole day with her and get properly inducted. She has a custom made van with automatic ramp on the back. As we were getting ready to hit the town, a following situation occurred... as she was getting ready to get in the van, next door neighbour went outside with his kid. No sorry, more like the kid run outside and the dad slowly followed him. Kid started running around the van, trying to get a look at my employer (another thing I despise in kids, the NEED to stare at a disabled person). It was making me really uncomfortable as one of my priorities was ensuring my employer is safe. The dad thought nothing of it, but I noticed that the kid speaks my native language which is Polish (we're in the UK). So I stood in his way as he was about to climb the van door, leaned towards him and said in a really calm voice: "please stop running around, it's really dangerous". Out of nowhere a wild mombie appears! I've never ever seen anyone more infuriated than she was. She didn't even bother speaking, went straight into shout-n-spit-everywhere mode. She said she'll report me for child abuse to the police and I'll get deported, she wanted my home address and my name, wouldn't even listen to me asking what did I do wrong. Eventually I just said to her "there's no point arguing with you" and jumped in the van. We drove off, my employer asked me what happened as she couldn't understand a word of it. I translated it to my best ability. A few hours later as we came back to the house the mombie was hanging around our front door. She demanded to speak to my employer (not a surprise, her haircut gave it away), but since it was time for her medication I got to send the mombie off home. She came back around after a while so we agreed to let her in, she wanted me gone so I just left as I wasn't in the mood for further arguments. Guess what card she played. My sneuflauxxxxx has ADHD and apparently I was not allowed to tell him he's being dangerous as it could (and I am effing quoting her now) SCAR HIM FOR LIFE. Really!!! I can't blame my employer for letting me go that day, she didn't want any legal trouble and didn't know me well enough to fully trust my words (or rather my translation of the argument). A couple of months later I saw the aforementioned mombie with her spawn around in town. She was shouting at him for being naughty. Well there you go.
7418	WELL, MAYVE YOUR SHOULD HAVE NOT VOTED OBAMA!	Everything about this wounded me
7419	I found that Shake Shack was an expensive In-n-Out burger	SHAKE SHACK IS OVERRATED There I said it. Kill me. I don't care. I stood on that line forever and was hugely disappointing. The pulled pork sandwich from Blue Smoke was much better. I also got that Fuku chicken sandwich and wasn't very impressed either. I've yet to have the bacon on a stick. That's next.
7420	Well if they vote against Trump, that clearly means they're more educated.	Did anyone notice everyone in the news jerking off Wisconsin all month talking about how "they're such conscious voters" and "they tend to be so much more educated"? Who determines this shit?
7421	Get your condescending ass outta here	i just looked at your post history dude. lots of video game and drug posts...maybe you should try new things
7422	To be honest, and this might sound selfish but I'd rather that he stopped producing than went mainstream.	I don't know, man. I love this guy's music but I guess if he wants his tracks to do well, he's gotta go more mainstream. Maybe produce music that's more focused on vocals than the instrumental, develop catchier melodies - make it something you think a good number of your friends would listen to more than once, or something that the radio or EDM DJs would play, or that big let's-players or e-sports organisations would use. He has an incredibly unique style that most people currently find boring but which I think would be a great strength if combined with a sound targeted towards a more 'mainstream' audience. It's certainly a sacrifice for an artist to have their true sound take a back seat, but one that many big names have done to get their music out there before they have the recognition to experiment or adopt their own true style once again. Just my opinion. I'm not a musician or experienced in the music industry by any means. I certainly wish 7MD luck whatever he does.

7424	Some restaurants who don't recycle oil, have a separate septic system for the kitchens so the oil doesn't go into the mainlines it just goes into a giant vat in the ground.	I once worked at a KFC, saw them dump about 5-10 gallons of used oil down the drain.
7425	PARDINUR *skritch*	*howdy pard-i-nur*

7427	Wow RIP	In Memory of Ron Brace | 1986-2016
7428	I've never rushed a temple before, IIRC my best was level 5 mountain temple.	How many levels is fully upgraded temple? I've had a level 7 I think.
7429	He was just trying to cut down on his word count by not attempting to describe some things.	**I've just got to get this off my chest.** I certainly enjoyed this book when I read it about two years ago. But I have to say, I think the praise for Dumas' writing is a bit overblown. He has a very annoying tendency to use the word "indescribable" (or various permutations thereof). "Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with **indescribable** tenderness." "...repeated the travellerin an accent of **indescribable** sadness." "He felt an **indescribable** sensation akin to fear..." "An **indescribable** ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance..." "...shrank before Monte Cristo with **indescribable** terror." "Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that **indescribable** expression..." "True," said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it is **impossible to describe**..." "This word was pronounced in a manner **impossible to describe**." "It is **impossible to describe** the sensations experienced by Walentine during..." "...eyes to heaven with an expression it would be **impossible to describe**..." You're a writer, Alexandre. It's your job to describe shit.

7431	Agree 100% As a Canadian I prefer to be fucked politely.	Agree 100%. The Liberals are just conservatives with better people skills. They play an incredible PR game to make it look like they're on the side of "regular people" while fucking us just as hard as the Cons.
7432	Gosh darn political extremists	I really like this - strikes a nice balance between humor and the story. Plus, that ending was super gay, in the best possible sense of the word. The thought of having to go to a vampire for marriage licenses is slightly unsettling, though.
7433	We are the richest people on the planet for absolutely no good reason at all!	Might as well blame it on sasquatch. Hard working white people, rofl.

7436	Nah bro, it's called akimbo.	I shoot rifles normally but pistols left handed. That just means I can dual wield.
7437	Too bad the man didn't live long enough to see Apple start turning a profit.	Had everything to do with the fact that Apple was bankrupt and had no viable products.

7442	Use it man, it won't be anything stellar but if you're making a bunch of frothy milk drinks it'll be fine	So I was gifted a Starbucks Buon Caffe 330 and from what I've collected is that it's a pretty cheap machine. I've found the manual and can get it working, but since I've never worked anything espresso related, I don't know what I'm doing. Does anyone have any experience with one? I won't be getting rid of it as it was a gift from my grandmother and holds sentimental value. I feel bad that it just sits here and collected dust. Thanks in advance for any help on working this.
7443	hirez is literally trying to remove guardians slowly starting with this event	Very cool. To bad no guardian skin though.
7444	There are more white people and less of everyone else in movies and tv than in real life	This really isn't rocket science. Minorities are called minorities because they make up a smaller percentage of the population. White people, in America, make up the majority. So who's going to get most of the roles? You do the math.
7445	Clearly shows that the vast majority did noting but take cover once the shooting started.	New Videos released in Waco Shootout
7446	Do you have the source?	Yes.

7456	That's what Pistol Pete did.....	Bird did it differently though. Curry isn't even really creating shots, he's taking any shot he wants and making it, including heavily contested shots.
7457	But it's European so fuck trying it in America.	TIL when a city in Indiana replaced all their signaled intersections with roundabouts, construction costs dropped $125,000, gas savings reached 24k gallons/year per roundabout, injury accidents dropped 80%, and total accidents dropped 40%.

7460	I just need to have a lot of rough sex before hand, got it, haha Thing is, I'm very sensitive about that kind of stuff, so I just know it will be awful :(	As someone else said, if your cervix is sensitive, it might be a bit painful--mine is, so it does hurt for me. Also, for my last one, I hadn't had sex or really much of anything "up in there" (haha) for almost 3 years (my doctor's office only requires them every 3 years with no risk factors, new partners, etc.)... so the speculum going in kind of hurt, too. But it really just depends!

7475	Not sure if you are describing the BLM movement or the other BLM movement.	How is occupying a federal building and threatening to kill cops not unlawful? It doesn't matter if you think their cause is just: it is still trespassing. Having bad laws on the books doesn't invalidate all others. More importantly, that's not their call. There are avenues and channels for these grievances, set up by the constitution they claim to defend. Don't like a law? Campaign against it. Don't like a ruling? Crowdfund a legal appeal. Don't like regulations? Hire a lawyer or seek legal aid (and if that seems expensive, maybe don't blow all your money on guns...). Don't take over a building that isn't yours armed to the teeth. That's pure childishness. How can people respect that? It's the epitome of a temper tantrum with the added threat to other people's safety. Fuck these guys.
7476	If this is true I will suck my own cock.Tag me.	Click for hype. There was a post on the CI website that was up for about 15 minutes. Another user was talking about the beta dropping in aprox. 42 hours. Was he right? Probably not. Either way, let the hype ensue.

7481	Look at this dude, living in the past.	+Wrestling fandom is and was built upon sharing and trade tapes and bootlegs in the backs of magazines for decades. In 2015 its gone digital.
7482	Yeah, because paying people to injure people equates to allegedly deflating balls.	Lol yes. Pats fans will always have a special place in my heart. They are the only other fans who know how it feels to be wrongly vilified by that douchebag commish.

7489	Couldn't they just mute the music via menu before matches started?	No 20xx, Evo had a long list of stages not allowed due to music, I'm sure they had a minimum number of adds, sure it's not as drastic as dropping a whole game but it does show how little they know or care about our scene.

7503	but then you can't selfie next to Mona Lisa	Fun fact: For years, there has been (and still is) a myth that flash photography harms paintings. The flash can emit UV light that will distort pigment in the art over time. However, some cameras have a film that stops the UV light from the bulb, and even more cameras (such as smartphones) don't emit the harmful rays at all. It's still distracting and annoying as hell though. Don't take your shitty pictures in an art museum. It's as bad as your shitty videos in live concerts. Experience it, then remember it fondly later.

7509	Kraken Zombie confirmed	DLC 2 MAP "Pohnpei" FLOODED, UNDERWATER, MOUNTAINS? As you guys know, Richthofen notes revealed the coordinates of Pohnpei, where we presume DLC 2 will be located. There is a lot of interesting geography here that coincides with our story line. "Pohnpei also contains a wealth of biodiversity. It is also one of the wettest places on earth with annual recorded rainfall exceeding 7,600 millimetres (300 in) each year in certain mountainous locations." Being one of the wettest places on earth, and now flooding due to the moon's explosion within our universe, there is almost no doubt that an underwater section of the map is possible. We could be traversing some mountains along side the jungle, similar to Dead Island. So yeah, LEAVE your ideas below on the whole map situation! I will be making a video today on my channel including YOUR ideas and comments so let's get started :)
7510	You mean tweet.	I'll answer for him. His info comes from Trump's daily email.

7518	I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT!	The frog must have displeased the giant heads. Headward, free now to rise.
7519	HE SAID DRAKE IS TRYING WAY TOO HARD TO STAY RELEVANT.	What?
7520	Yes because the only times you should taunt are intractable taunts or gloating like a dick.	I didn't mean an actual gameplay use, I meant a time when it makes sense to use the taunt. There's partner taunts for goofing off and there's solo taunts for showing off. I'll go back to the chestburster again; when would you use that? It doesn't fit in anywhere. All of the other taunts before the broom and chestburster fit into screwing around or post-kill, but these two are just weird. The chestburster is just a random animation, and the broom is a weird solo thing that doesn't make sense to use after a kill since you'll just have to undo the taunt in a half second anyway.
7521	This is flawless logic and you should not consider the implications of what you just said.	If they remove all the muslims from their country whether they are good or evil, doesn't matter, they will be safe. I support this.

7534	Oh none of that matters... BOMB THOSE COUNTRIES OVER THERE SOMEWHERE!	Most redditors are americans. Very average americans. The average american isn't exactly known for extensive knowledge about geopolitics. To put it in a less polite way, most redditors are rather stupid hypocrites, and a good chunk probably wouldn't even be able to find Syria on a map...or any of the countries they'd like to bomb.
7535	So glad I don't have to add ghetto tape to my iPhone to make it feel not cheap.	I fixed the squeaky 950XL back plate Got some felt tape, and put a couple of layers of it on the phone part, in the corner where the SD card slot is. It made the backplate nice and snug in that corner when putting it all back together, and now no more squeak.
7536	how else are they supposed to get to where they want to go, though?	Maybe they should not have run towards trucks and be in the middle of the lane in the first place?
7537	But those are real art!	Looks sharp m8. This subreddit doesn't like quality traditional. It only up votes shitty water colors and space sleeves.

A question about authentic cases What is it called when you repeat a authentic cadence over and over to end a song. V-I-V-I and could you give me an example of a classical piece that does that. It would be very appreciated. I'm writing a short paper for a class and can't find it anywhere.

7544	You would have to trust that government creates regulations that actually solve a problem and not just redistribute money to their donors.	I had a nice response written up yesterday and hit the back button and deleted it, can't find the will to rewrite it in full. My main point was that private corps that have to potential to impact common goods (such as the environment/climate) require oversight, which tends to be the governments job. If someone else can step in and actually enforce remediation requirements and environmental regulations, I am open to non-government oversight. But something is needed... even with the current regulations, spills and depleted sites go unfixed. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion, though.

7556	Hey now, what if I am exactly the same as you!	I don't like it but that doesn't mean different trans lady hates it. From time to time I notice a post in r/asktransgender about maintaining erection during sex. If you have met one trans woman then you have met one trans woman. We are all different.
7557	I'm yet to see any proposals from the leave campaign on the ring-fencing of the money we currently contribute, so I think you're probably correct.	And we have done extremely well, we punch above our weight in almost every sector of science. We also get a very high percentage of EU grant money compared to every other member state, there is no way that UK science would not be heavily affected by leaving the EU.
7558	Judging by his user name and post history he's just some private citizen that's really good at video editing and loves cleverloop.	Take your advertising elsewhere, makes me wonder if any of this stuff actually even happened.

7560	Yeah, too bad we didn't just massacre them in the first place.	Yeah, as I said, if the court says it stands, then so be it. I just wish the whole thing could've been avoided in the first place.
7561	Yeah, I'm totally triggered	Not being politically correct is a lot different from being a racist. I embrace Trump's anti-PC manner of speaking and if it offends you, you're part of the problem. Seriously, it's not racist at all. Perhaps you need a safe space to go to?
7562	Within the last 6 months turnstile, 69, for today, and gideon have all been here and a ton of other metal bands i dont care about.	That's very refreshing to hear, thanks for the input.

7582	This.	You literally contributed nothing to the discussion. and because i know what you will respond with just go ahead and re-read the title.
7583	This sounds the most likely.	They said there was "no simply solution". Read: we have like 2% of our workforce maintaining destiny 1 and we don't have the time to address firebolts correctly.
7584	Honest question- would any young Sanders supporters actually be happy working in manufacturing?	How do we realistically bring new, well-paid jobs to replace the manufacturing jobs lost to overseas markets?i

7591	No you don't understand, companies aren't allowed to shift focus if it means it's more profitable.	It's almost as though making money isn't the point of a business, right?
7592	Someone fails to detect sarcasm.	Now you're employing reductio ad absurdum. Who suggested the police should disband?
7593	It's not like they're democratically elected, right?	Unaccountable? Really?
7594	I'm pretty sure I have seen this reposted about 100 times now	Cosplay level: Perfect
7595	The biggest problem is it is arguing over the the figure a few places right of the decimal point with regards the problems wildlife faces.	Note to Author: When writing a pro-nuclear power article, don't spend half the ink on reminding people about the many aspects of fission that they dislike and fear.

7601	see, this is exactly why businesses need more h1bs.	Bioinformatics student here, I don't know how it is with other disciplines in STEM but our whole course consists of 12 students only. We are the smallest group on campus and I think that showcases the current situation quite nicely. Meanwhile the business courses are overrun and people have to sit on the floor or have to stream lectures at home. Now whenever we show up at a job fair recruiters are swarming us without even asking about grades or other qualitfications. Simply put they're desperate for new talent. When asked about payment prospects it becomes clear, however, why nobody wants to work for them. Basically they want you to become their software guy, their lab guy and their statistics guy all in one but pay you jack sh*t to actually justify this kind of responsibility. Guess the MBAs can't afford to cut back on their bonus payments.
7602	Forgot the	But it's not accurate
7603	LAN/LAS/OCE are huge dude we need to wait even more	Yeah they said that "EUW" is to large,and they will need more resources before releasing it,but whats the problem with getting it live on EUNE? the server is fairly small compared to euw
7604	The Rams got diddled	Sources says Rams gave package they did because of belief Titans were ready to pull the trigger on a deal with the Eagles.
7605	By that logic Visualization is terrible and no one should use it for anything since a physical unit is better...	Just think about it, when you have a VM it needs to hit the NIC card, then the virtual switch, then the hypervisor, then the guest OS, back to the hypervisor, back to the virtual switch and out. With physical unit it hits the unit's NIC goes right to the OS and back out again.

7615	They literally aren't acting surprised even a little bit.	You act surprised? That's like 80% of people when money is at stake. Very few will fall on the sword and pay up.
7616	A bit of both, I believe.	Did he suddenly start performing worse at PSG or did they just decide Trapp was better?
7617	And we all know that only America has bad teachers.	A good teacher will realize they wrote a question that was ambiguous and correct the question accordingly.

7623	This will end well.	Germany is passing a law that allows a Muslim to kill you if you "insult" him, he'll only get 5 years for killing a German

7625	Nice	I bet he falcon punched her real good.
7626	WELL THEY GET NOTHING BECAUSE COMMUNISTS DESERVE NOTHING!	Those dirty commies always want SOMETHING.
7627	Or now they finally have different talents and the ability to tune more abilities differently between pve and pvp.	I wish people would just accept this. It may not be perfect, but if Blizzard sets aside a spec for PvE, and a spec for PvP, then ultimately it's much easier for them to balance it. They have been trying to balance it the other way for 11 years and it just doesn't work, you can't give a class the utility and durability it needs for pvp while also giving it the dps you need for pve.
7628	Why aren't they using the lighthouse tracking?	Yes I know it's a Vive but it's a radical GIF
7629	Obviously the assassins believe in state's rights	It's already established that JWB was working with Templars. Also, I'll say it again, why in a million years would the Assassins ever support the Confederacy? The Confederacy was *literally* formed to preserve slavery -- that runs in direct opposition to the Assassin's founding ideals.
7630	No, we won a Super Bowl with him this year.	Brandon Marshall has never even made the playoffs
7631	Does that mean Pakistan is number 10?	It's not racist if it's true. South India is #1 India. North India is #4 India. Bangladesh is #8, OK?
7632	And the story... eww....	I didn't like Deadpool, I found the humour juvenile/witless a mix of "you look like something fucked something" and "fuckstick bag of assholes suck a dick" - Reminded me of teenagers who had just learned how to swear. The action was mostly just CGI gore as well. That's just my opinion though.
7633	She's too good at play playing victim with attacks; he has to stick to facts	New here, just looking for insight: how long can Bernie go before he's forced to directly attack Hillary? I'm a complete babe in the woods here, so please be gentle. I just got here and I have no idea what I'm doing. That said, I really am concerned that he's going to get stuck in a position where he has no choice but to snipe at Hillary good and proper. He's done a great job of attacking her by just stating basic facts, and actually pointing at her and saying she's part of the establishment, but I'm worried he won't be able to keep it up. Hillary's "say it to my face" bit during the NH debate was clearly an attempt to get him to slip up, and she is not going to stop doing things like that any time soon. Is it potentially damaging? Does Bernie's jiujitsu have the potential to make him seem false and evasive? Let's be clear: I LOVED his handling of her during the NH debate. I'm just worried for the future.

7639	if im not mistaken, cant you rip off the laminate on real RI's?	ID God taken first week Hey guys, so my Rhode Island IDs from ID god came in and from an inexperienced eye looked fine. I used it twice at the same place and all was fine. Last night however, I went and after scanning it, the clerk looked at it, ripped the laminant off, and told me it was fake. After being pissed off that a 20ish year old clerk went above and beyond the call of duty to fuck up my night, i started wondering what was wrong with it. What could of been noticable that the guy destroyed mine. On a side note, whats a good vendor for domestic quality IDs?

7645	IF YOU LIKE TRUMP, THEN MAKE SURE TO DONATE AND PHONEBANK!	Just a little thanks to all of my fellow centipedes. Before I came to this subreddit, I admit, I had some doubts about the Donald. Mostly, that Shillary would beat him. Then I finally clicked on r/the_donald. I came for the memes but I stayed for the dreams. This is now the only subreddit I care about. I have 100% confidence in Don and I have never been more excited about an election. I love you guys!
7646	Did you let him touch your hair?	I had a dude standing outside the dining hall ask if he could touch my hair. Does that count?
7647	Why would the police lie?	Yes, I read that. But that is what someone (not clear from the article who quoted the police officer) said the police offer said the attendant said. I am asking for where the flight attendant said that.

7657	Whew!	But it's so much more fun to think about things instead of making fun of them. Although satire is one of the best forms of humor in my opinion, I'll give you that :-) Didn't mean to imply that you were interested, don't worry.
7658	I can't tell where this argument is going, are you arguing against term limits now?	It wasn't that different, and the country didn't fall apart.

I a fare leave seat right behind me a complete mess, covered in sand and dirt. Since I didn't see it I picked up another fare. Luckily he didn't sit on that side but definitely saw and probably had to deal with some sand. Uber support doesn't give a shit, told me since i picked up another fare that it means it didn't affect my driving and cleaning fees are to compensate for not being able to drive? What about the expense of CLEANING? Why is it called a cleaning fee if it is a LOST REVENUE fee?

7726	excellent points, it's not like swat at all!	(1) Headshots aren't an instant kill (2) It is a round-based elimination gametype with CTF mixed in (3) There are a variety of weapon pick-ups on maps and power weapons (4) Maps are entirely symmetrical Besides, your logic doesn't make sense regardless. "SWAT is just a bastardization of regular Slayer. All the lazy Bungie devs did was remove shields." That's how ridiculous you sound. And I can't help but notice you didn't answer my question. Have you even played Breakout?

7728	You're being pretty elitist man... It's not like hard mode is just normal mode with one additional task.	I feel your pain! My raid group fell apart, and now I'm rolling the LFG dice before doing my sherpa runs every week. Sometimes it's an awesome group that does Oryx on the first try, sometimes it's a dude who has no idea what he's doing and basically forces us to 5-man the whole thing. Sometimes it's a couple guys who are deathly afraid of taking responsibility and, you know, killing an ogre and 3 adds.

7730	'Cause if you don't talk about cheats, clearly they don't exist.	Rule 11 Posted a thread about cheating players in WT earlier today, which was promptly removed, without message. Can any mod explain why rule 11 is there in the first place, and why they remove threads without reason message ? My thread was not condoning nor encouraging cheating.
7731	It was a joke :p	Not really. In real life, I generally jump out and check the 'blindside' of my trailer (the side you can't see in the mirror due to angle of the cab) to make certain that it's not going to hit anything when backing into tight spaces. People assume you have to back a trailer in on the first try and as soon as possible!...You don't. Being a truck driver doesn't automatically make you a 'super driver'. Watching some of us reverse trailers into some places could become the most comical Olympic event ever sometimes!

I love turn-fighting but I'm learning to BnZ with the later Beaufighters but they're quite slow and they get targeted pretty much straight away. What's the best plane just to have fun learning to fly/not a spit? Are any worth spading? I've tried the Firefly but it seems to heavy to have fun with. Thanks guys.

It should cost **$700** but it should be **-$100** off on black friday (that was deal when i got it 2 years ago) to a cool **$600** (tax not included). The only thing I had trouble with it was that my monitor was pretty old so I had to get a converter to plug into the alienware.

Corruption, a liar, whatever. That's not my cup of tea but clearly it works for some people. But to attack Hillary for not being pro-worker is just ridiculous.

Everything from Marc Laidlaw's retirement to Gabe's "The only reason we'd go back and make another classic singleplayer etc" it all adds up. VALVe has moved on. To expect HL3 now is retarded. VALVe would rather launch a rocket into space than work on HL3.

It's died down a bit this game. But it was like he had a built in excuse for losing. Having said that, I do hope Aches refinds his form. I think he is entertaining. nV was looking good for a while.
7809	Ah.. The ole' "fuck the teams not in the north because they have smaller fan bases" can't get enough of the close minded thoughts, really.	I'm sure it would include Arizona, Carolina, Nashville, probably one of the Florida teams... maybe then the league will realize you just need some Ontario boys who know how to scrap and grind and don't wear visors!

7811	I thought Kevin Rudd was at the UN, not running a hotel....	Eh, told two people on staff this week that they had a month to go before they are to be unemployed. 11% seems to be lowballing it. Ed: If you have experience working in hotels and don't mind working with a massive dickhead, i.e. me, PM me your resume.
7812	And to that latter group, I say, "You will eat the cat poop!'	It doesn't surprise me, honestly. Comedy is so hard, and it's also entirely subjective. There are very few 100% agreed upon comedy masterpieces. Like, we all pretty much agree Godfather is a great movie. There are some people that think Anchorman is fucking hilarious, and others who are positive it is a complete piece of cat shit.
7813	I hear Hillary is deep in the pockets of *Big Math*	Paul Krugman from the NY Times on Twitter: How can Clinton be ahead? Sanders just won 7 states, total pop 20 million; Clinton won Florida, pop 20 million, by 30 points. No mystery.

This actually made me angry in Utah, I called ahead and was told there was no reservations and you just had to wait your turn. Went all the way down to city creek from South Jordan and was told there WAS a list and the next "appointment" was in 2 hours. I went and ate at the food court, the entire time I was there NO ONE was using the Vive. So I went back over and asked if I could use it while they waited for someone to show up for an appointment. I was told no, they couldn't show it to me just in case one of their appointments showed up.. Total BS. I also had my wife and brother with me to try it, very dissappointed.

7821	The last sentence doesn't really make sense at all, you can't get wrecked against a plat main jungle because you don't even choose jungle as a position.	Why does this game force its players into specific roles Thought about this while reading dynamic q complain threads. Yes I understand pros have main roles and that most people have a preferred role that they are much better at than others. But wouldn't it be better for the game to have a more rounded out casual player base that is pretty decent at every part of the game? Most of league players never will or don't want to be pros, we just enjoy the competition and the game is fun. Now with this ranked system, before the game starts you have to decide which roles you want to play, completely ruling out the possibility of playing the other 3 roles. Probably from Plat up there is a significant skill level difference between your main and other roles, but below Plat I don't think the gap is that big. So the game should encourage people to try out every role to some degree so a Plat adc main can jungle somewhat effectively and not get completely wrecked going up against a Plat jungle and single handedly lose the game.

These companies (Apple, Sony, Samsung, Google, Microsoft, take your pick....) are all waving their dicks in our faces and we are enjoying every single second of it. Incremental upgrades every 12 months and people flock to buy it like it will be the last model ever available. Again and again and again and again! What we should be doing is building the very best we can and make it fucking last for 10 years, not the complete opposite.

7858	When they began the serious drug prohibition, they were able to talk to public into endorsing the growing surveillance/police state, so the government gets what it wants very quickly by stirring the publics emotions with regard to crime.	Also, the 'abuse' might not even be an abuse. Photos of an underage girlfriend? Child porn. Photos of yourself? Child porn. Send photos of yourself? Distributing child porn. It's somewhat ridiculous. The crime should be distributing audio-visual material where one or more of the subjects were coerced to be in that position by physical or other means. Penalizing the recipients just because you want to end the production is just wrong. It never worked out well, and it never will. They tried it with drugs they try it with lot's of shit. It's just not the correct way of dealing with shit. The guys viewing a phone cam video of some teenage girl masturbating who might or might not be over 18 but is certainly old enough to be attractive aren't actually acting in detriment to society in any possible way.
7859	But man, didn't you know that having customer support automatically makes all EA's scummy, over-priced DLC ridden games like 10 times better than any of that hella garbage on Steam?	Steam has a few thousand things that Origin doesn't. Like games.

I actually have all these illnesses but I'm not trying to diagnosis myself. I went to an actual physician and doctor and I'll be damned before I post it to my facebook. I fucking hate kids who do it for attention. I hate that I feel guilty for using the word "trigger" as I feel its only used by attention seekers nowadays. I convinced myself it was all in my head because I didn't want to be a tumblrina and didn't get the help I needed when I should. These kids are actually detrimental to kids who are suffering.

7882	Apologies for the Murdoch source, just saw it on Google and face palmed immediately how Reclaim thinks this is positive attention for them.	Didn't want to give Murdoch any click revenue so I did a "mosque pig" search and this sort of thing seems to be all the rage all over the western world.
7883	Yes but we need to keep minimum wage below the poverty line, because employers can't afford to pay higher wages in this stagnant economy.	As America's middle class collapses, no one is buying stuff anymore / Boing Boing
7884	What burnout he is only in 3 missions?	Halo 5 even goes into why he's not his usual self. Don't you remember Blue Team's opening cinematic? After Cortana's loss, Chief is hurting. He's trying to push that away by throwing himself full on into his work. Mission after mission after mission. He's burning himself out trying to get past Cortana.
7885	No shit, schlomo.	TIL That Reddit Is Being Used As A Platform For Israeli Propaganda And The Censorship Of Opposing Viewpoints.
7886	Saw a Jackie Chan looking character driving away in one last night in the ID with a black man that looked like Chris Tucker on the back.	Seen it? Stolen motorcycle (Capitol Hill)

7888	Ya'll did something wrong then, the GK is soooooo OP you should be able to kill it in one mag!	we tried to kill a vanguard (mid range) for 2 min until we ran out of ammo.....
7889	Funny how things work out like that...	That makes me want to visit more.
7890	Well, it's not like Price is a common last name or anything...	Cool thing I found in Fallout 4 So in Fallout 4 if you name you character Chloe Price, Codsworth will really call you Miss Price (they said that he recognizes over 1000 names), which I found pretty cool. I haven't tried out any other names yet. Sorry if this is not directly relevent to LiS, I've just wanted to share.

7895	Yeah cause we all know Cloud was the star of those games	Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and re:coded say hi.
7896	"This is troubling, to say the least."	Just a reminder: Matpat is making another FNaF theory video and claims that he has "solved the entire lore". Honestly i kind of lost a lot of faith in him after last time where he basically said "Yeah there's no answer." and then immediately after Scott said "Yes there is, in fact, and answer." So I really don't know. His FNAF 2 video was apparently spot on except for the Purple Guy's identity. Maybe he'll think of something amazing again. I miss Scott.
7897	You mean Ben "It Ain't Rape If She's An Ape" Garrison?	I'm glad Ben "If They're Black, Stay Back" Garrison is once again able to post his bigoted cartoons without the Jewish trolls editing them to remove his messages of white pride.

7900	What makes you think Telltale would do that?	Considering 70+% of players so far went with the beheading rather than the slave marriage, odds are Mira will get her ass killed or permanently locked up in a cutscene at the beginning of Season 2 if you kept her alive in Season 1, so they don't have to flesh out a whole new storyline.
7901	That's *such* an INTJ thing to say	INTJ, and MBTI tests are shit.
7902	Info wars all the way!	CNN is a very reputable source. They may not get things right every now and then, but they're very legit. Unless you believe in the Illuminati, in that case Mad World News is the reputable source for you.

7905	I can tell from your accurate posts, ability to drop proper terms like "Nautical Miles" and just use miles, and in-depth knowledge of the North American ADIZ and Sovereign territory that you are in-fact an Air Weapons Controller working for NORAD.	Yes, it would. They would never even make it close. They would be engaged within the 12 mile barrier.
7906	Pfft, it's basically just penicillin.	Throw out moldy bread, too-- it's porous and the mold spreads quickly. This is only a good method on dry, *dense* foods like hard cheese.

7914	I'm a straight dude, but that's one damn sexy jesus	Fw: fw: Thank You Jesus AMEN.
7915	Yes that would be the gist of my original comment	So that would say to me that you prefer IW's games. I hated AW, loathed Ghosts, and stomached MW2.5 for its lifespan, then quickly picked up BO2 and loved it, so I sit firmly within Treyarch's camp. To each his or her own.
7916	This is so accurate	You gotta understand that I have a business to run. I have overhead and this thing is gonna sit on the shelves for idk how long. I'll give you 10 bucks for it and I shouldn't even be spending that much

7944	I thought our law makers now were the mid twenty something hippie's that were around in the 1960s.... You would think they would have somehow interacted with weed on a level in their lives that was not detrimental to someone's health.	To piggyback, many lawmakers are looking at Colorado as a test case. It's only been a couple years since recreational use has been allowed there. If this proves to work consistently in the U.S., it'll spread. It's also hard to defeat old perceptions. Many lawmakers spent their entire lives believing marijuana ruins lives. Even with the evidence, it can be hard to accept that they were wrong and they may be conflating marijuana with all drugs. There is certainly a criminal element to the illegal trade in marijuana that goes beyond the mere untaxed buying and selling. Even though legalization would likely remove that criminal element, lawmakers are skittish to institute a policy that seems like it is weak on crime. So it will take some time. This is why it's so important to vote in your local elections. If you want change to occur faster, you need local legislators and Congressmembers who will implement that change both locally and federally. People are so focused on the race for President, they forget that the executive branch can't make the laws they want, the legislature can.
7945	LCAR made me do the longshots in HC Dom, I lost my mind trying to get them in core	That thing was horrible. It's so down on power the long shots on Core were a ballache to achieve. Lcar and Pharo took me the longest to do. Good luck I hope you get it quick sir.

7947	500+ hours, there is 0 predictability to wasteland's bullshit.	It's lower skilled players who haven't yet gotten full control over their car that run into problems. Honestly people just need to play it a little more and see that it really isn't that big of a difference.

7957	"A 3 mile run is quick and easy" good one	If you're running 5-7 miles just once a week, you're gonna have issues. You're not building your endurance like that, you're just messing up your muscles by overexerting them. It's not like lifting weights, where you do leg day on Wednesday and don't worry for another week. If I were you, I'd run a distance of 2-3 miles, 3 times a week. A 3 mile run is quick and easy, and you'll quickly build up the endurance you need to enjoy running longer. But running 7 miles once a week is like doing a big deadlift, once a month, and expecting it to get easy.
7958	Nope!	You wouldn't happen to be the guy who just posted a bunch of lies about me and failed to admit it or apologize would you?
7959	Cut your dick off.	Any advice for a Theon/Reek cosplay? For our latest rugby social it's been made Game of Thrones themed and I've been asked to dress as Theon/Reek. Does anyone have any good suggestions for cheap and easy ways to make myself stand out as Theon or Reek?

7973	Shocker!	NX leak confirmed fake

7975	Half life 2	Greatest video game of all-time? I would go with Super Mario Galaxy 2, amazing plot, fun controls, creative environments, a unique direction for the series, beautiful graphics, imaginative level design, music that not only is beautiful but "stands out", it was just pure greatness. Which game do you think is the greatest video game ever made?

7983	Yeah but americans are war mongering demons who love bombing people and we might as well glass the hajis.	Both France and Russia have nukes.
7984	It couldn't have been from decades of intense suppression that caused people to rise up.	The only reason Libya became destabilized in the first place was because foreign governments provided arms, training, and logistical support to local terrorist groups.

8000	So we should also assume Logia DF users in One Piece don't retain their intangibility?	like i said in a different comment. you should only have to bend the rules for a www post like that if the two characters wouldnt be able to fight otherwise. like we have to assume that shinigamis from bleach can interact with non bleach characters regardless of what the rules say because otherwise they wouldnt be able to fight. same with flash. we have to pretend that he can access the speedforce outside of his universe so he is able to fight.
8001	They said explicitly that shields upon revival were reduced I believe they even gave a %.	the revive shields weren't nerfed. Those are still the same as before. The change is that sniper rifle critical hit damage was corrected to receive the proper multiplier, thereby giving more snipers the requisite damage to revive snipe.

8012	I thought it was because he took his name off it.	When he tried to argue that Road Hard's reviews were a result of his political beliefs. The Newman doc came out after Road Hard and is sitting at 90% on rotten tomatoes. Was that because the critics all of the sudden became super conservative?
8013	Yeah, the best way to combat perceived oppression is to lash out at someone with significantly less power than you.	Black patron refuses to tip white waitress until she returns his land to him.
8014	Yes, let's learn say smokes for a map which is exiting the mappool.	If you want to be playing CS instead of being scrub tier, you need to learn every generic set smoke, flash, and molotov on all the active duty maps (except newke, learn inferno instead), including timings. Then either buy FaceIT or buy ESEA, and get used to operating in a proper team environment, then get a team and play in leagues. Anything else is quite a waste of time

8016	Tribes Bros represent.	Tribes 2 represent! I also played a ton of TF2. I've been waiting for a mobile shooter for eons. Tribes Ascend was a debilitating failure and I have a deep hatred for CS:GO and other generic military shooters. Stiff controls and spending more time dead than alive isn't my idea of fun. Playing the stress test weekend really took me back to the good old days.
8017	On a Mic'd up of Sanders when he was stretching he was repeating some of the criticisms he gets just to hype himself up "He's too short, too skinny, too slow, now look at me."

8027	chandler getting his womp on confirmed	A friend of mine posted this on Facebook, had to share. For all you Patriots haters wondering about Chandler Jones, here is the deal: Brady had all the footballs from Saturday's game inflated with nitrous oxide, because that is better somehow and definitely illegal. Jones's job was to deflate all the balls to below league minimums, but he didn't leave a window open so he got dizzy from all the escaping nitrous. Then, instead of taking his usual morning illegal steroids he accidentally took his super illegal ultrasteroids, which he had already taken the night before, and had to go to the hospital. When Belichick heard about this he was so surprised that he accidentally hit himself in the eye with a drone he was testing to fly over the Chiefs' practices this week.

8042	Uh, I'm sorry, I don't know any progressive who would back something as useless as Dodd-Frank ^	That's a beautifully revealing piece written by someone that's considered a pretty progressive former member of Congress. The truth is that Bernie Sanders is that smug, know-it-all philosophy major everyone knew in college.

8054	Asian girls everywhere...U-C-L-A	That we have a lot of Asian students. I always thought it was a little exaggerated, but somewhat true nonetheless. Also I always thought UCLA had a nerdy reputation, but I have began to feel that we're not known as a nerdy school nationwide. Some schools just get that reputation and some don't I suppose.
8055	But then the backers would have had to compete in a free market and where's the fun in that?	Or the bill writers could just have been more reasonable about production to begin with and noone could have punched holes in it, but that would be to reasonable right?

8064	Hey, ALL marriage is a fraud, and it's rather difficult to spot, no?	No because as much as I empathize with the burden of some men, that doesn't mean I trust any of them. It probably would be easy to spot it as fraud anyway.
8065	Whoa baby	There is a laundry list of what Obama lied about in his past from his book. How much of that did you even care about or attack? A great many of his lies were to make him more "black" and to create emotional moments in his past that defined him. All made up and full of shit for which people like you could give a flying fuck about. But a new black guy shows up and suddenly he isn't black enough he is the "uncle tom" for you Democrats. You pick apart every little thing when you didn't do it to your racially accepted black person. In the end it makes you a hypocrite....and you could give a flying fuck. That is the most sickening and pathetic thing about this whole ordeal. You care what a black Republican said in his past and question his morals and his character but you worship a black Democrat who DID THE EXACT SAME FUCKING THING. So tell me when is it ok to lie about your past? Because if Ben Carson is disqualified for doing it, your boy Obama should have never ran in the first place. And that is how you become a hypocrite.

8071	I'm so ready to have to spend $1 per competitive match.	Who feels "ready" for Competitive Matchmaking? Hello again, you may remember my post; "When did you know you were "good" at TF2?" Yeah, that one. Well, it ties into this. I got thinking about Competitive recently, hearing and seeing these things about the upcoming matchmaking that will be implemented sometime at the end of the year. It's not that far away, and my friend and I have been practicing and getting gamesense nailed into our skulls. I've been told I'm definitely ready for it, but not everyone is. My question is, are you ready for it? What are you planning on maining for it? Do you generally feel "ready" for the Competitive Scene? Any other imput regarding competitive matchmaking, competitive gameplay or information to help people going into the scene is appreciated, the more we can do with a post the better.

8082	Yes, the human need for physical contact is such a dirty, shameful thing.	Youd probably find someone if you weren't so obsessed with touching or getting touched. You just sound like a huge creeper right now. Don't try so hard and don't put so much emphasis on getting physical with someone.

So i had to make new account again, but i want to use the name "iron Kahvo" on him too but i cant cus i made account named that already. And i cant change my name because im not member. I dont wanna buy member just to change his name to something else. Is there any way to delete runescape account or change my name without buying member?

8100	What happens when your inventory is full and they are returned?	A friend of mine lists items on the market for prices that nobody would pay for them as a way to store them temporarily. I think they last for 6 months or a year before they're returned to your inventory after not being sold.
8101	I wish condi-rev was viable too :(	Sorry for not directly giving you the type of answer you are looking for but despite which is the "best", they are all viable.
8102	and a lot of that is because "opinion" is driven by the media, and the media (being basically 6 corporations who own and control all US media) is owned by the same plutocrats who prefer Hilary to win, since she is the candidate who best suits their agenda.	A lot of US politics is people believing what the politicians assert. Remember how Hilary is a "done deal", so don't even try? And that assertion affects how different voters act? This is like that. It's not like this in many other countries, but it sure is in America.

Its almost like the new annoying trend is to talk about how bad other trends are.

8109	To tell you the truth, even some Christian Syrians are very conservative and don't integrate, but the fact that they are Christians makes them mix with the majority of the Europeans, yet they differ on some subjects.	Great to hear this. Syrians like you are more than welcome in Belgium, in my opinion. I fear however that the majority of Syrians coming now are very conservative Muslims, who won't fit in the Belgian culture.

Now I've been wondering this since I started Part 4, but I wanted to hear the sub's thoughts. If all the post-BT Jojo protagonists lost their stands, who would win in a fight? Now, of course, if Joseph lost his stand, he still has Hamon, so he'd be set, but what about the rest of them? Personally, I think Jotaro would come out on top, due to his sheer bulk, but what do you guys think?

8153	Well i'm hoping with this wave of Star Wars movies in the next couple of years, if they don't blow ass... They'll continue filling in gaps.	Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan was one of the few redeeming features of the prequels! I thought he was a perfect fit and played his role head and shoulders above everyone else. A movie set between III and IV would be ripe with stories to tell and now that Lucas is no longer able to force his awful dialogue/plots on the franchise, it would make an amazing movie. I feel McGregor is a little tarnished by the prequels as a whole and he deserves to play that character in a 'proper' Star Wars film.

8159	Found the nutritionist	Your body will naturally build muscle as you work out, and if you're caloric input is less than your output, you will burn fat too. Honestly, the paleo diet is a load of garbage (unpopular as that opinion might be around here). For that matter, so are all mass produced diets. Make an appointment with a nutritionist, they'll help you devise a diet specific to your needs, and that fits in with your habits, and preferences. It'll be a whole lot easier for you stick to, it'll be better for you, and it'll be a whole lot more sustainable long term.
8160	Yes, because greedy capitalists are obviously to blame.	And no one knows that more than the Iranian people. We had a democracy at one point before greedy capitalist nations came after our resources and prompt up dictators.
8161	What's a BBG?	My advice is to motivate them to not be so sure they want to fight the BBG unless absolutely necessary. Show them some of the people who rely on the BBG. Maybe he's secretly feeding the hungry. Maybe the creature protects the portal between the living and the dead (and has been partially, but not totally corrupted). Maybe she's trying to prevent a future that she hails from. BBGs shouldn't be so one dimensional that you can't make consequences when they win an unwinnable fight. And should they still want to try? Punish them. Take the things they care about. The starving people die. The realm of death starts to creep into the land. The future that the BBG was trying to stop comes true. Whatever it is the PCs (if they care at all) should feel partially responsible for what has occurred.

8167	Yeah I know some nurses that graduated nursing school never hanging an IVPB	I don't think I did 1000's of clinical hours for my BSN, and I went to a well respected school in Canada. And most of those hours, honestly, were kind of a joke. It's really only the final placement where you have any sort of autonomy approaching that of a real RN (the public health placements where I did powerpoint presentations about safe cycling shouldn't really count) You're right about not all experience being equal. ICU experience is a certain KIND of clinical judgement. I'm not sure if it would help when you're talking to your patients about a heart healthy diet, for example. But I agree with the residency program. Unfortunately, with the state of nursing education as it is, it will never happen.

Bought it yesterday to try it out, out of 7 mags I was able to craft, only one of them was ~~above~~ 100% mag size. Hell, I get that number easier with an i31 blueprint. Don't be expecting 120-130% mag size from that. Not worth 141k DZ funds and DTechs it require to craft. Shop smart, agents.

8179	Ibalik ang Pilipinas sa mga disenting tao!	Why do Mar supporters claim that they are the "intellectuals"? I honestly find it a bit irksome. Where did this come from?

8180	Good luck and easy quick delivery vibes to you!	All the drugs baby!!! 39 weeks even and my amazing doctor agreed that today was induction day! Got to the hospital at 7am, got all strapped up and they started the pitocin. I'll be honest, my first two babies were natural just because I didn't have time for drugs. This time... I made sure to make time for them. Holy hell ladies I'm in heaven. For the first time in months my hips don't hurt. I don't care about the contractions, I'd happily take their pain over hip pain, but now... Nothing! I'm relaxed, watching price is right, texting random friends and enjoying the tingles in my legs. Send easy labor vibes if you all would, I'd love my last labor to be.... Pleasant (only word I can think of to use).

8186	Man, how am I going to heat my house and water?	When I say dead, I mean that it isn't highly profitable and it is not growing. Oil production will be managed in Calgary for many years. Will it pay well ? Will it be a vibrant industry ? Will it grow ? I doubt it. Natgas is already dead. A lot of natgas was wet and that provided the profit. I'm anti nuclear, but that is just me. I think the rise in renewables, especially wind, kills nuclear in the public's mind.
8187	Can someone slow that down a little more?	Driver turned to wrong oncoming traffic lane
8188	Fake.	Pushed into the pool
8189	yes, you are.	Lame.
8190	Because Sanders totally isn't doing the exact same thing with the evil 1%.	Honestly, I dont think so, but he is a great example of how someone can manipulate people's fear with mindless rhetoric and target a set of society as the public enemy. All we're missing is a bierkeller.
8191	You do seem like a really NOICE girl tho	My 6th sense is telling me you are a sympathetic girl (Im a guy) Translation included
8192	amazing argument, i am completely and utterly convinced you are correct	There so so so so SO is a gender wage gap. Wish there wasn't, but really, there is.

8194	LOL but god ISN'T REAL, I don't need FAIRY TALES to comfort ME!	Pretty much. I'm agnostic and whenever I defend some religious person for practicing their religion I just get karma raped.
8195	nah just use thorn tho	Good job on the Triple. Way to keep your head. I've actually stopped reading a lot of the Playbook posts for the same reason. I get that some weapons are better than others. But so much comes down to play style. I LOVE the Telesto. It was hard to pin down, but I love it now. Same with my Zarinaea-D. I know it's not the best, but it was so much fun. And I got pretty good with it. Too much comes down to nuance to state "X is the only option" emphatically.

8198	I have all of Bowies albums, isn't Amazon Prime great!	got three emails from Amazon offering me his new abum, pretty ghoulish really
8199	If McNair hasn't questioned Ricks capability to this point, there's probably nothing that will.	I hope when we do, his performance is so stunning that it finally makes McNair question Rick.

8202	I identify as hyper kin	ProCube Now Available!
8203	The way he brought up all his personal anecdotes and ranting about "fuck doctors and I pour my drugs down the toilet" and preaching to the guy to get massage therapy instead of medication just makes it seem like he has some prior history with drug addiction in his family/friends that is making him so over the top.	Drug addict tries to work high on pills first day

8205	Waifu Wars	Would You Want a Fire Emblem Game Based on a Specific War? As the title says, would you want a Fire Emblem game based on a specific war? And I mean very heavily based bar mages and pegasus knights and such. Personally I would love to see a game based on The ~~Crimean War~~ War of the Roses. I don't really know why though.
8206	Psshh... That was 8 years ago!	Scumbag Hillary Clinton
8207	Maybe he can do well on loan and come back	Valdes is starting for Liege atm.
8208	Guess we better revoke the humanitarian aid this year, if we can't cure poverty/disease/and mental illness we can't do anything	lol, we don't have enough money to help some of our own citizens, but lets bring in 25,000 'refugee's who likely will bring their stone age beliefs here.

8215	3) If a girl calls the police and punches herself in the face it's your fault and you are a monster and should man up.	What did we learn? 1. If you hit a girl, it is your fault, you are a monster and you should man up 2. If a girl hits you, it is your fault, you are a monster and should man up
8216	Let the down-votes commence!	Is there a fast way to launch into Rockstar Editor? ( director mode ) The process of getting into the editor seems too long. Is there a way where I can just launch directly from desktop into the editor without needing to go through all the startup menu crap , then join the single player , then open the menu and load up that way and go through more menus. if not , why not.
8217	Gottem	Cuz somethin came in the mail today...................... Deez nuts.

8227	Draft value will go down Auston2Boston confirmed.	Auston Matthews suffers back injury, set to miss 'weeks'
8228	It's almost as if sarcasm forces people to utilize a different perspective on their situations causing out of the box thinking that has no limits.	Well it obviously does. I mean, look at you being sarcastic, and coming up with such creative and unexpected comments.
8229	We've said this many times, but with that logic, cop would have been the best adc in season three from statistics.	Most people would be wrong then, well if you were looking at Summer Split. Statistically he was just ahead of all the other adcs. In terms of top talent in NA at this moment. you could argue they are close but I just don't see how you could say it convincingly with the split he had.
8230	Had Cooper actually ask questions about problems in America, and not about fantasy football.	how did the DNC effectively eliminate Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee?
8231	Because our inept front office doesn't know how to keep players happy	Why is Bledsoe in that list?
8232	Well that relationship is build on a solid foundation	he has a kid (4?) and she has 2 kids (2-4ish?) he got divorced earlier in the spring and immediately started dating this new chick. think they may have already known each other prior to that though. personally i don't think it's right to involve a kid in your dating after a divorce. do that shit on the weeks that the kid is with the other parent. until you know this person is someone you're going to be in a committed relationship, keep it fucking seperate. but that was never the case and then out of the blue we find out they're getting married, in a week. the whole thing is pretty stupid. she proposed to him, i would assume because he was essentially forced to move in with her (nowhere else to go, after staying with my dad and stepmom for a few weeks and he hadn't made any effort to find a place after selling his house) think he just liked the free child care. so she wanted to lock him down for whatever reason, not sure why as he bounces around jobs with no real career prospects etc even though he's in his mid 30's. big part of why his ex-wife was fed up. there's some more dumb little shit but you know what, none of it affects me or any of you guys so cheers to that! i'm done with my random rambling. just wanted to share it with someone since it's a sensitive subject in the family that i can't really fuck with right now, but soon... i have no issue with this woman, from what i've heard she's a perfectly lovely person. i'm more pissed at what this dumbass is doing to his kid and the rest of the family (my stepmom is pretty upset about the whole thing even though she does a good job hiding it and his sisters are also a pretty ticked) she also just bought a nice new house in a better part of town, but i guess figured friends and family would take care of the bill for their trip since they just bought a house.
8233	Ok people, repeat after me.....	I think I'll just echo what the commentor said: *"Someone from Florida writing a show about Buffalo. Chances are its going to suck. And be about snow. Lots and lots of snow jokes."*
8234	Don't worry, modders will fix it	Don't be so hard on Black Ops 3's performance :( Activision is only a small 18 billion dollar corporation with 36 years of PC Gaming experience, you can't expect them to make a cheap $100 game with a beta that works on day 1.
8235	Satan herself *would* claim that....	Rowling herself has stated it has some Christian influence. Thing is, it also has a lot of Celtic/Pagan influence too, which is why I think kids should read Harry Potter and not the Bible, for a more modern succinctuation of the good lessons in the Bible without all the barbaric shit.
8236	Nah	With all the other shit in GoT I think he can get away with making the wall that was *literally built by magic* really tall
8237	But but but those posts were before he saw the light and decided to not just shitpost.	I like how of the 18 submissions you have on reddit, all 16 are at 0 points. The two that aren't? 1. And both of those were removed.
8238	Like you asked me "Would i like to be stabbed in the front , in the back or in the forehead"	Neverwinter, Tera or Archeage better?
8239	Pff, Bernier is the one making all the highlight reels	James Reimer named NHL's third star of the week.
8240	Flawless logic	Uuuuh, we've had to listen to their fans being obnoxious, smug, and all around fucking annoying for years, i think we can allow ourselves to be just a little "obnoxious"
8241	This will certainly help to alleviate racial tensions.	Brown University to spend $100M to 'address racism and diversity' on campus

8247	"Yeah, uhh... I just ordered the salad..."	"The Beast" Breakfast : Uplands Diner, Swansea, Wales
8248	What if it is a bullshit holiday like Columbus day?	From a lawyer: Never propose on a holiday. The ring is then considered a gift and now belongs to her. Ordinarily, when the ring is given as a proposal, the ring is not a gift and is still property of the proposer.
8249	Yeah, that doesn't look like a good film.	How a 17 year old girl directed and sold her film 1st feature film on 16mm film. Very informative interview.

8253	You didn't like Topher?	Or a good venom
8254	Yea I ***really*** should've been paying attention to free agency when I was 6 years old in the 90s	If this is the only time you've been frustrated during FA, you mustn't have been a Patriots fan for long.
8255	I still love that that asteroid got a Stargate-themed name.	It's 2038, not 2036. 2036 is an asteroid. The 2038 thing is sorta like the Y2K thing. On Jan 1, 2038, we will move from the largest integer available to a 32bit memory space. Essentially causing a buffer overflow. Obviously, if we move everything over to 64bit by then, there won't be any issues. Or if the asteroid from 2036, Apophis, kills us there won't be any worry for 2038!
8256	No, this is much worse.	Meth, not even once.
8257	Fat	Without naming it, what's your nationality?
8258	This makes me feel so proud knowing that our country's president not only welcomed Al Bashir into the country despite an ICC warrant out for his arrest (with SA being an ICC member), but also directly contravened a court order from South Africa that prohibited him from leaving the country and got him out via a private military airport.	South Sudan lets fighters rape women in place of wages: UN
8259	Judging by the timing of his comment (after yours) I'm going to assume it's a joke.	You serious or trolling?
8260	Learned that lesson trying to follow the whole Russia/Crimea/Ukraine mess.	This says more about the idiocy of the general public than the media will literally sell you shit if they could
8261	it just disgust me they used Cloverfeild name for marketing bump	Just saw 10 Clover field Lane, awesome fantastic Scifi/Thriller if you get the chance check it out! Brilliant acting by everyone especially John Goodman, he was so fantastic I can't remember the last time he was this good. Plus your on the edge of your seat the entire film just waiting to get answers. Very much reminded me of my experience with Signs in 2002, but I would say amped on 3 times.
8262	But which 99.999% of every other person?	My brain is faster than 99.999% of the brains on the planet
8263	Even when he loses, he always get under 16.	Congratulations!
8264	Thanks.	Well done all around.
8265	It's still in the same ballpark, I guess ;)	Still way more accurate than Luckey Palmer.
8266	So, video and photographs in the article are fake according to you?	It's like getting a history lesson from a Disney movie. Sure, it's "based on a true story", but you know it's mostly fiction.
8267	Except this *should* be far, far, far easier to implement.	I slide this one right next to the Rubick 'copied-abilities-are-green' suggestion.
8268	I mean i never did bring my cat into it... but she does have a great left hook tbh.	No one who commonly tries to scratch your eyes out can be the GOAT.
8269	Yeah because it's goona completely shake up the meta	No hype for the HERO?
8270	Am I too dumb to understand what is funny about this?	Well, what's it gunna be?
8271	When you can't say something nice .....	Of all things to say :/
8272	I think he want to build a wall.	Has he been clear on anything?
8273	I don't man, throw a "I'm tellin ya Mike" in there and I'm pretty sure it'd be more Gruden than Madden	Now I'll tell you who could win an election: Brett Favre. He had it all. The initial boom, an arm that could throw a ball, and the longevity to just go all the way. I mean, Brett Favre is the Brett Favre of Brett Favre.
8274	Nah, he's gonna endorse Trump!	That would honestly be the worst possible thing anyone could do in the race right now. When he does bow out, he's going to do so gracefully and support the candidate whose voting record matches his by about 93%.
8275	If you look on the number of Palestinians alive over the last 100 years it is going to be very hard to claim any genocide is going on.	Eh, I'm not sure that's fair. Israel seems to be looking for a long, slow genocide. Generational genocide.
8276	Fitzzzz	Nicks 95 or Larry 95 ..
8277	"A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still."	There are no facts here besides you re-directing the conversation of this thread else-where. If you couldn't sway my opinion, you won't be able to sway the majority of peoples opinions.

8282	Global ^cries^Kappa	Please stop saying your pre-rank change rank when people ask your rank.
8283	Come on now, what are you gonna do, declare war on another country and NOT upgrade your nuclear arsenal?	Trump isn't going to pass a flat tax, then declare war on another country and upgrade our nuclear arsenal at the same time.
8284	But she also states they're around the corner, and unless she's super powered, she can't see that they're still following her.	Except she says on the next page that they were following her.
8285	17 is legal in some states though so that's not creepy	Holy fuck, the oldest girl looks maybe seventeen and the younger girl is like 12 *at best.* What the fuck! Fucking pedophile rapist dickwad.

8290	The tactleneck!	Something something tacticle turtleneck
8291	True, although the onus still seems to be on the parent.	And academies. And a lot of state schools have switched to academies. So while its not quite as end of the world as some people are making out, it is still bad.
8292	It's not genocide when brown people kill other brown people.	As recession bites and land disputes hit Brazil's agricultural heartland, indigenous people face land grabs and assaults by violent gangs." .Tauli-Corpuz called for immediate measures to be taken to protect indigenous leaders, 138 of whom were killed in 2014
8293	Yeah, Terraria wikipedia is a lifesaver!	Just experiment, and resort to wikis when confused. It's not really that big a deal if you accidentally waste items, especially in the early game.
8294	LIMA	...ECHO!
8295	What's PII?	I first realized this when I read about him calling people idiots for giving him PII and bragging about the sketchy things he might do with it back when Facebook had just been launched.
8296	Hardware *if you know what I mean*	Maybe steam could include these kinds of questions in their next hardware survey?
8297	surely you mean Communists	Arresting homosexuals
8298	Tide goes in, tide goes out.	What is something that nobody can explain, but everyone understands?
8299	The lame, overused Facebook jokes that are now slapped onto a picture of a minion .. Yeah the minions are annoying but the low quality of the joke pisses me off more	What type of humor do you find completely unfunny?
8300	I just sank into my chair and was ever so depressed	When he entered the game, I knew something bad was going to happen. When he gave up the home run, that was the tipping point where I thought Torre had to go. Anyone with half a mind knew weaver was trouble and Joe was clueless.
8301	Millennia of neanderthal nose-picking can't be wrong	Atheist here, can't argue with that logic. Am now saved.
8302	Sure, but mine have multiple devices, and a remote	Sure... Same as unplugging isn't it.
8303	That stable is awesome	Let there be Light and Fire
8304	You mean swamp German?	Shot in the dark, but anyone on campus a Dutch speaker? I've been learning Dutch for a couple years, on my own for the most part but with the help of some other native speakers. I can't rely on them very much, though, and was wondering if anyone on campus spoke Dutch or even was interested in learning? I'm looking for a casual conversation practice partner to meet up with whenever is convenient.
8305	He means that when you press restart in the Start menu, you can hold down shift while you do it.	Uhh, what key is restart? Do you mean the reset switch, which 90% of cases no longer have? Or the button on the start menu, that says restart?

8308	Be the change you want to see in the world	You have expressed the thoughts running through my head as I pressed submit. You're right, it seems we aren't.
8309	As a server admin in sandbox games, I'll regularly cheat in materials for the sake of not spending eight hours to get my building idea out.	Cheating in video games. I'll never understand the appeal. There's 2 categories that I can think of... A) The people who need to win to feel good about themselves but can't win without hacks. B) The people that do it to upset others and somehow get enjoyment from it. Either way you look pathetic in everyone's eye and we're thankful we don't have insecurity issues like you.
8310	Nice argument	gtfo

8312	nice find, holy shit lmao	jdm64 lounging reached another level
8313	They play Extended the same place they sell 8-tracks.	Why doesn't extended... extend? Nobody close to where I live plays Extended. Hell, i'd not be surprised if anyone plays it at all. It's very limited. Why don't they increase the blocks to 6 blocks or something like that?
8314	Thank you.	Reductio ad absurdum
8315	A good hitchhiker never forgets their towel	D:
8316	Ya I think I might send it to an influencer, because I don't have tons of followers yet	depends, how many people are going to know you're giving it away? If I have 30,000 followers, I can advertise a giveaway on Facebook, and probably be seen by 1000 of them who may spread it a bit, if I have an influencer who has 10,000 followers and they showcase it it will probably be seen by 3000 of them but with less resharing and posting, but still I think you'd get a better result.
8317	They get so unfriendly when you point out that it's an actual hate group, don't they?	Found the member of a hate group.

8323	But was Kloppenburg "inspiring" enough?	The same people who voted for Sanders in Wisconsin then went home because theeir work was done. 15% of them didn't even vote for a WI supreme court justice. So now we have that asshole Bradley. Yes she's an asshole because I've read what she said.
8324	MFW Zach getting laid AF	Facebook Body Shaming with a side of Double Standards and Hypocrisy!

8327	Cena's AA to Orton's RKO.	What is the craziest reversal of one Finisher into another Finisher that you've ever seen? Example: Seth's Curb Stomp into Orton's RKO at WM 31. Also, had anyone ever turned a Frankensteiner into an x-factor (or whatever the actual move is called)?
8328	Will never forget when JW used the run boost on Inferno with the AWP.	except jw usually does it in locations that aren't as critical to map control or does it when he knows he has a 1v1 situation. simple constantly dies going for the 1v2 or 1v3 fights that then completely destroy map control. simple was lurking mid this map which is not what jw does. jw is an entry fragger while flusha or olof lurk for fnatic
8329	Rainbow mimics are the actual final boss	Is it confirmed that there aren't rainbow/glitch mimics?

8335	Islamic women are oppressed, so lets liberate them by telling them what they can and cannot wear and further alienate them from society!	French "Socialist" PM calls for ban on Islamic headscarves at universities
8336	Hey give the man his safe space.	Yah, why have movies that look at one of the defining features of early American history. Lets just ignore it because it makes you feel uncomfortable. Pathetic.

8338	MCSkillet	I'm thinking of making a YouTube channel, need a name, any suggestions?
8339	But we just haven't done it *right* yet.	I would bet the collectivist ideology she advertises to children has been responsible for more deaths than all of the 'combat weapons' sold in the US ever.
8340	Well, obviously women are more sensitive to insults.	If you think getting called an asshole is the "flip-side" of women getting called bitches whenever they're assertive, you need to spend some time talking to the women in your life about this stuff.
8341	Good one.	*Obama needs to be more like Putin!* *Obama is a dictator!*
8342	Yeah, the amount of content being produced totally keeps going down every year...	The consumer won't benefit from the decimation of producer rights. Not in the long term, anyway.

8344	It actually is possible and there is a custom Skype client out there, but it's not possible (as of last year at least) to do calls on a custom client.	Can't make a custom Skype client because its protocol is proprietary and closed-source.
8345	Wow you have a different opinion then me and that makes you stupid.	Wow, your stupid. Alien was a great movie, why would you say otherwise if you liked it?
8346	No, a lot less like that.	More like the idiot with the target should have been holding it to his side.
8347	Yep, and it looks like a 13 year old game.	These are screenshots from an 13 year old game. Let that sink in for a moment.
8348	A Goofy Movie	Films you would love to come to bluray, but still haven't..
8349	Yeah, I can't believe people think Barraza's Nsig somehow isn't as good and versatile as Hattori's.	An important quote from Exo that the community could learn from... "I think every legend is REALLY balanced. Honestly, like, there is no such thing as 'my legend is preventing me from being number one' It really isn't. SOME legends in different METAs have an easier time with certain weapons, but at the end of the day it's how you make of it. Sword keeps getting nerfed, this is the truth, sword has gotten nerfed over and over, it's small nerfs, just hits here and there, but at the end of the day I look at the good parts because they did nerf sword in many aspects BUT then they added Nair into recovery as a true combo, so I look at the plus sides. They've started nerfing stuff in better ways because they aren't killing the weapons. They're tradeoffs. " - Exo BMG isn't trying to ruin or really "nerf" anything. They're trying to make an already very balanced game as perfectly balance as they can. So far, they have done a great job, so why don't we have some faith in them to do the right thing when it comes to game balance.
8350	I must correct you, Nice_Shot, Jared *did* a lift a finger...he shuffled his chips to fake people into thinking he was bidding on a punishment.	That's because everyone should just *give* Jared the 100k without him having to lift a finger, because he needs the money more and he's a nice guy damnit!
8351	Just finished reading this fucking loved it but I was a little confused by the last chapter.	"Everyone's inside of me" (HolyLand)

8354	Do you think people have time to read instructions when they are driving a car and approaching a roundabout?	Disagree. They do just fine as long as there are instructions posted at the approach to one...
8355	That was my favorite moment in the series.	BIG WoT spoilers below, like seriously, if you keep reading this comment without finishing the series you have only yourself to blame. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Not to mention actually killing Demandred.
8356	Yeah but it has "free" in it so it must be better for the peoplr, amirite?	Retirement? I think you mean work until you die and then are replaced with someone who will work for a lower wage. That's the FREE MARKET

8358	Don't forget Hillary Clinton failed to stop 9/11 and got soldiers killed in Beruit.	It's kinda sad how true that is. Trail of tears, the Vietnam War, the Great Depression? That's right, all Obama.
8359	but but but, the liberal media.	"following the outrage over the secret videos that were released suggesting the harvesting and selling of baby body parts. " you mean "that blatantly lied about the harvesting and selling of baby body parts"

8368	stop being racist!	I mean being mistreated and being framed for murder by the police after DNA evidence clears you are 2 very different things.
8369	Obviously Attack of the Clones	Which 2nd movie in a trilogy was the best of the three?
8370	But it made over $200 million throughout the world, that means it should win an Oscar,	SOC was nowhere near best picture quality. It wasn't even the best biopic I've seen.
8371	Yeah they have to hire a guy to shut hsgg up as well.	They have one but yea..
8372	THAT'S ABUSIVE!	My cats name is Pickle and responds to nipple. So I think that works with cats too.
8373	Yeah but at least that's not as bad as this...	Just like how everyone on this sub would refuse to admit that lower education levels link heavily with support for far-right parties.

8375	Sometimes HR departments are given another HR department so they also have someone to hate.	A human resources guy? What the fuck were they thinking? I've never met a head of HR that wasn't a slimy gladhanding fuckstick.
8376	I demand a depressed lego figure	I don't get the hate. It's just a wheelchair. It's fun to imagine stuff where you're not stuck in the chair, but this gives people the chance to build things that are awesome even with the chair. I'm disabled and find this cool. It's a small addition and doesn't have to go deep to represent all disabilities.
8377	Get out of here with your real world thought!	Now ask yourself if this fact--which is probably true--has any possible overlap with why we can't just wave a magic wand and have a Swedish-style welfare system. Generous, *sustainable* welfare systems require a level of social cohesion and homogeneity that the US has never had and never will.

8382	I think he's referring to [1 Corinthians 5:12]	So how do you spread the Gospel to non Christians? Im probably misunderstanding your response.
8383	I think he needs to "accidentally" get drunk and sleep around more before you can be completely sure, so just step aside like you've been doing and continue to let it happen.	Actions Speak Louder Than Words?
8384	They should disable the shoot button when a player with less than 90 finishing is on the ball	Kostas Manolas: 10 finishing, 12 long shots, and the lowest overall shooting stat out of every gold card in the game.
8385	But....we're spartans.	I just got the greatest idea! If you join late into a game, you should come in with an ODST Drop Pod! I know this is never gonna happen. But it would definitely be cool. What do you think?
8386	Not OP, but it's probably short for "Assistant General Manager".	Interesting. Pardon my ignorance but what is AGM?

They moved it to the bottom corner of the screen so anytime you're on a video call people see the bottom of your chin and it looks like your staring out in space when really you'll looking straight ahead at the screen.
8390	Apparently Paulus was a most loyal subject to Hitler, since he totally committed suicide as Hitler wanted, and never went on to criticize Nazi-Germany from Russian captivity.

8391	Remember, you're only getting one side of the argument; there could be more or less to it.	I'd be wary of a biological parent trying to get in my kid's life after they already tried once to take my kid from me. I would be suspicious of your every move, as well. You can't really blame her on that front. But all that extra? Breaking her word, talking about their relationship...she sounds like a jealous lover. Only, she knows she's hurting you and she's being malicious.

8426	That was borderline porn though, and I think you'd have trouble finding a screencap as ugly as the one they used, in the -gatari anime sequence in question, if only because that one used white toothpaste which is less jarring than the teal stuff.

But is a two-*room* apartment the same as a two-*bed*room apartment? Would a two-bedroom apartment not have at least a living room, making a 3 room apartment? I'm asking because I've never understood this bedroom-metric.
8429	Tell your girlfriend to buy you a new bed, then dump her.	I, working professional, caught SO, roommate and student, of relationship lasting 5+ years cheating on me. Feeling lost. This is my first post and a throwaway, please forgive me if I'm not doing this right. But here goes... Yesterday, I bought some food during lunch break and came back to my apartment to find my girlfriend sleeping (taking a nap) and as I got closer I saw another man in my bed. -The bed I paid for. I was disgusted but also seething with rage. I left, quietly fearing I may not be able to control the rage transforming into violence if I confronted them. It all made sense now. I had previous trust issues, being somewhat insecure a few years ago, but I learned to control it. The signs started when she would constantly be texting this other person. The green light on her webcam would be on sometimes, but I didn't know why, but I ended up catching them once. I confronted my SO about it last night after I got home from work, and she said she's sorry and it would not happen again. There was also some liquid evidence on the bed. Her explanation was, he was giving her the attention I was not. My argument is since they spend more time together at school, its obvious what the outcome is. I work a day job, so my schedule is consistent, but the student's schedule is very open allowing for a lot of free time, which probably made it easier to cheat. According to her, their talking started a few months ago. About the same time, I noticed she stopped trying as much in our relationship. What initially started off as friendship, started to turn into romantic interests as they began liking each other. He would be the initiator of sex and she felt terribly guilty afterwards. They've done it twice. What a homewrecker. Spur of the moment thing. She did not foresee a future with this other person. Asking if she would've revealed the info later, she said she did not know how to approach the topic. I'm asking for advice since I feel very lost right now, part of me wants to just leave, but I still have very strong feelings for this girl as I thought she would be the one.The other part wants to forgive her and give her a chance. **tl;dr**: GF cheated on me with a colleague, says I'm not giving enough attention. Need advice on next steps or forgiveness.
8430	Trump in 2017 will mean a right leaning moderate replacement for Scalia.	I'm not voting for Hillary if she gets the nomination. Bush's presidency got Candidate Obama. Maybe President Trump will end up in Elizabeth Warren in 2020.

8436	FNaF World is kinda about how people and Scott himself took FNaF	The FNaF Games are based on Scott's life Kind of, at least FNaF 1, cute furry animatronics that customers think are horrifying - This refers to Chipper and sons, a cute happy game which players thought was terrifying. FNaF 2, the company giving up on the old robots and trying with the toys - This represents Scott thinking about giving up game-making and moving on. FNaF 3, the company realises that the mascots are terrifying, and create a horror attraction - Scott creates FNaF. FNaF 4, horrifying nightmares about the animatronics - FNaF became a big hit and a lot of people were scared of it. FNaF World - This game is non-canon, so it doesn't really matter.

8442	Maybe if your ships delivered as much freedom as ours you would be more sentimental.	Americans are really sentimental about their warships. You always want to preserve them. I'm British and unless a ship is exceptional like HMS Victory or just plain lucky to have been used as an oil jetty and forgotten about until they are also appreciated as being of historical importance like HMS Warrior we just pay them off or scrap them.
8443	I see, but there is a very strong tendency from some to say "it's a construct so it should just be broken"	There's a very important distinction between gender nihilism and TERF bullshit. Gender nihilists believe that gender is a social construct to abolish, but it still exists (society makes it), so we have to work within it by rejecting the cis binary while working to abolish it as our end goal.

8454	I usually have 100-150 ping, and I get melted like never before.	I play on console but I'm guessing its probably the same on pc since it is p2p. But they added something called lag compensation for people who have worse connection and give them an advantage. It isn't a bad thing but there is just TOO much in this game( it's in a lot of other games as well)

8459	i couldn't say it better.	Yeah, the one thing I hate with all these branded phones is a) their usually stupid and shitty nonsense they layer on it and call an interface and b) the fact that Android upgrades come rarely and/or slowly. Plain vanilla Android with instant access to the next version of Android is awesome. I'm really psyched about the LG hardware, but not so psyched about the software.

8463	And there's *Damage Control*, a Marvel sitcom in development, too.	It would be a summer show then which is possible if they want year-round Marvel. SHIELD is the fall &amp; spring, Carter in winter, Most Wanted in summer. It could also still be on at 10pm, they just won't try and push the censors anymore then SHIELD or Carter would. Maybe to try and get some synergy going like Arrow/Flash which they can't do with Carter because she's too far in the past. John Ridley is also working on a secret Marvel show for ABC as well.

8467	Gotcha, maybe I'll try to get a few.	Depends on your behaviour vs what they like/don't like. I unlock every lock I come across, hack every turret/protectron and generally choose the good options in dialogue so it took about an hour or so of game play to befriend Deacon to to point where I have his perk. However I also steal every that isn't nailed down so it might take considerably longer for someone like Nick.

8501	Coloured hair; clearly alternative.	Not that alternative
8502	This times a million.	In my experiences you still have to include an email with your purchase regardless of setting up an account- then you will receive notifications of your shipment
8503	Aside from all the fraudulent things that went down, the early registration deadlines, the closed primary and the last minute voting sections operating hours being cut by 6h contribute a great deal to suppression of the turnout, which is what they're arguing there.	Mysteriously changing the affiliation or purging hundreds of thousands from the voter rolls. But yeah, I'm sure it's all just a coincidence. Just like every other state. Shucks, running elections is hard.
8504	That's Russians for ya!	It was a little disturbing that they were laughing before they knew he was alright.
8505	Nah dude obv cheaters, they got like 2 headshots in a row	or they were better than you on buy rounds
8506	Then I guess it took more than one dart	Breitbart had a previous heart attack. Heart attacks cause permanent damage to the heart.
8507	Just offer a few prayers to the Omnissiah.	Has anyone tried percussive maintenance?
8508	69 A	surprised there's no A's
8509	Maybe Riot doesn't know how to fix even one of the 19 bugs he has	Why don't Riot fix the Yasuo bugs? He feels like shit to play and if you look for these bugs they are pretty obvious. They are the worst kind to! The can't attack type just makes you feel powerless to show off your skills and outplay someone.
8510	Tell that to Lance Stephenson	Not so much a rule as it is a pattern, but in the NBA you can't fucking breathe on any of the good players without getting a foul called.
8511	Mass Effect multiplayer platinum mode anyone?	So its a wave-based survival mode? How terribly disappointing
8512	Any solo thing is archaic and anti-team.	Oh yeah because HOTS supports are capable of solo rampages, right?
8513	B-but that would require work!	A better solution would be for the user to check the mod for incompatibilities, and then report it back to the author.
8514	Buh buh buh they are forcing me to except transsexual people exist!	The only one drawing attention to the matter is the player in this case - you *did* click on *two* dialogue options in the tree. Don't ask questions you aren't prepared to learn the answers to, as it were.
8515	Oh you mean like a Secret Wars?	DC needs a way to take care of all these different earths. If they could come up with some sort of event that would somehow merge them it would be perfect. Maybe some sort of crisis involving the numerous earths.
8516	Call me Cassius Christos	Men of Reddit, if you could go back in time and have a say in the naming of yourself, what would you change if anything? Side note; what do you like best about your name? Bonus points; help me come up with names for our son who is about to be born because we're super stuck. Sonny mcsonface has been discussed.
8517	pedophelia duh.	I would counter that with: Why is it that we percieve such statues as impropper? (don't answer with "just because that's what we say is bad")
8518	Now back to the issues, the issues that are important to Hillary.	YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WITH YOUR AMAZING EXPECTATIONSSSS
8519	But, this really opens everyone's eyes to the problems, so they'll get around to fixing them for next time	And in the end nothing was done.
8520	You need a	Because it's AmeriKan propaganda. They want us to forget that the USA MAKES US THE TARGET FOR TERRORISTS!
8521	You're right, he's way worse	Okay, easy there fella. Goodell is not Hitler.
8522	I had to have been standing like right next to you lol	Video I took of Sonny last night at the Game Awards after party. (Sorry for the potato audio)
8523	Come on Bernie only needs 97.6855756% of remaining delegates	BernieBots after seeing the election results
8524	The hyper 212 evo, or the cryorg h7 for a bit more for a bit more cooling.	New CPU Fan - Fairly cheap and quiet I am currently using the CPU fan that came with my i5, I want to replace it with a quieter fan. I've seen some chatter in the past on here about a fairly inexpensive fan that a lot of builds use. Was curious which fan that was. Also, I've never replaced a fan before. Do I need to buy thermal paste when I do the replacement? I didn't put additional thermal paste on when I installed the current fan. Also the current fan has left some residue, do I need to scrape that off before putting a new fan on? Basically is this as simple as taking the old fan off and putting the new on on?
8525	By n00bz using Blink-Shotgun Warlocks \#YearOneBestYear	No it's supposed to be announcing you want to be shotgunned!
8526	This kid just had his dreams made.	Boy runs onto Rugby field after game and gets tackled by security.
8527	Because sports.	How is he allowed to just be misogynistic on national tv?
8528	Yeah because we're really seeing a lot of updates and bug fixes	I'm not saying that no one got laid off but this is an ongoing MMO - they're not going to lay off a bunch of programmers at release, given that they've got updates and bug fixes to do.
8529	There's no 2nd amendment guaranteeing our rights to meth or ebola, moran.	Imagine if 8 children in a state found and injested meth and either were left damaged or dead. Or if eight children got access to cars and drove and crashed them, either injuring or killing themselves. Or if eight kids in Tennessee had ebola.
8530	But dude everything is NA fault, it's literally hitler	lol these guys always so quick to blame NA
8531	Yeah but would you spend 50 bucks to make 14 cents?	Then, to directly answer your question: Yes, absolutely. Assuming the numbers you cite are accurate, a $1.80B return on $48.71B is about 3.6% PER QUARTER. That roughly annualizes to over 14%.
8532	Homosexuality is evil after all.	"Let's finally include a gay male romance in his game!" "Okay but it has to be evil."
8533	New PurpleBoi comic for restarting under new account confirmed.	Will No
8534	Yea, because the whole thread is a great unbiased representation of public view.	Whole thread about people wanting to leave
8535	I don't think you understand what "setting" means.	I didn't know "Denver, Colorado" was a game setting. What menu would it be in?
8536	What about corners?	I would say our inability to finish is more of our weak point than set-pieces. Once we get into the final 3rd and around the 18 yard box things just start to break down.
8537	The middle finger shows even more emphasis.	Firm scowl. Firm voice. Firm finger, pointing inside. Say "Go. In." They'll understand. Or firm scowl, and finger to your lips.
8538	What's the third one over?the brown one?	Tha Doge Pound
8539	I know how the Qur'an was compiled but I am saying that in any such thing, unless it was written by the Prophet himself, there is always room for something to be missed.	The Qur'an was written in the company of the Prophet, memorised completely in his lifetime, and compiled by Abu-Bakr two years after the Prophets death. The Uthmanian Qur'an that became Canon was signed off by the Prophets closest companions. Not to be rude, but equating the compilation of the Qur'an to that of the Bible only makes you look uninformed.
8540	You are making the assumption that people are "reasonable".	I Just Dont Get It So, whenever this sub gets brigaded, it seems so organized and focused. What's up with that? Do a bunch of lurkers get triggered or does BCND organize this? I find it hard to believe that a bunch of people would waste their time on doing something like this. Internet arguments seem so pointless to me.
8541	Get off our internet you silly Brits!	Yeah I came here precisely to point out that 'burglarized' is most definitely not a word.
8542	You can also tell because Jagex brought Vic back and has a Treasure hunter l promo that's great for stocking up on bonus xp, just as they did before the last double xp weekend	Next Bonus Exp Weekend? Does anyone have any idea what month this will occur in?
8543	Because if Sanders does a tour, it's guaranteed to propel him to the lead!	That will change. Bernie is doing a black college tour to spread the word.
8544	lets be real though, when was the last time TSA let a bomb through the gate?	Bug: When you throw a Zilean bomb on Jayce's acceleration gate it disappears. I was playing with a friend yesterday who was playing Zilean and we had a Jayce on our team. When my friend would throw a bomb on Jayce's gate it would disappear but the bomb would still go off when the time hit 0.
8545	That would actually be a great experiment :D	Sure, leave out the apostrophe, why not. And hey, while we're at it, why not leave out a limb of any children you might have in the future? I'm sure you'd love that.
8546	That's some next level social disorder you two seem to share.	Why i love PoE community
8547	He said good :( Believe me, I'm trying my best to play Blue Moon too.	blue moon
8548	Yes of course... Zero tolerance defines that in the name... Idiot	Would they have suspended any students who were shot because they had ammunition on their persons while on school grounds?
8549	So he's Joe Dirt?	or finding out through DNA they are your cousins or long lost half sister.
8550	Quick quick, I'm sure there is some social media page that Sanders supporters can brigade in protest!	Monday's surprise Democratic Forum will be hosted by Andrea McGuire. She has hosted Hillary Clinton fundraisers at her house, co-chair to her 2008 campaign, and even has a HRC2016 license plate.
8551	But why don't you want to pay $320 for four Jaces?	This is why I no longer play standard. Way too expensive for cards that are going to fluctuate like crazy in the next few months.
8552	yeh, not 100% ill get another one..	Save the cash! Just tie it up! Buying the same mount is gonna cause the same problem
8553	SIP = Snow Insulated Panels, so you're good either way	Future post: "should I build my snow home with packed snow or SIPs?"
8554	Yeah, obviously to overdose on homeopathic medicine, you'd have to take *less* of it.	That's the dumbest suicide attempt ive ever heard of
8555	this made me laugh waaaay more than it should :D	Bots know the best AWPing spots.
8556	Because they can't afford a car.	The point of systemic problems caused by racism is that while many white people are poor, black people suffer disproportionately. Even during the days of slavery, the poorest white man could consider themselves superior to any black man, working professional or slave. It is not that way anymore but there are still 'privileges' to being white even if you are impoverished, even if you are not yourself living a life of privilege. Acknowledging privilege isn't oppression olympics or who is the most oppressed, it is understanding how race can act as privileging in one aspect of your life. For example a white poor person isn't considered to be having an easy life, they might not know where they are going to sleep or what they are going to eat, but they probably don't worry about whether they will get pulled over or shot for no reason by police.
8557	Yep, seems like today won't be the day ;/	ya very true tbh i'd be lying to myself if i ever thought clg had a chance on overpass
8558	Yeah but the guy had been drinking therefor it's ok.	The one I cannot get over is the man climbing out of the vehicle after a terrible accident and the cops just shoots him dead.
8559	There tends to be just one or two writers rather than a full room of them like on many US shows.	British redditors, I love your television programs but why do seasons have so few episodes?
8560	Can't tell you how often I've wanted to go out and just slaughter some orcs after playing Shadow of Mordor.	Yeah, and violent video games turn people into murderers
8561	That clearly worked well for Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright.	Expecting all Jews to vote for Bernie is like expecting all women/feminists to vote for Hilary.
8562	Yes of course that's exactly what's happening here.	He's not doing that at all. People have a "fuck America" attitude on here and like to take shots any chance they get. He's calling that bullshit out. Anyways, isn't it worse to use a situation like this to push that agenda?
8563	Prospect pool looking deep!	Craig Button's top 50 NHL affiliated prospects
8564	DOTA 2	Favorite low stress games? First off, I mean stress in terms of bodily stress, not hardware stress. I thought some of my brothers would mistake that. I have ulcerative colitis. In my mission to treat it to a, hopefully, healed state, I need to combat stress. Games like Rocket League and Battlefield 4 are not helping since they usually leave me throwing my controller and keyboard around the room, screaming how bad I suck. What games are relaxing, enjoyable, and reduce any stress? I'm thinking of getting Firewatch since it seems to be a peaceful experience in a virtual forest. Thanks, you guys are the best!
8565	Don't give that money to inner city schools or anything.	California bill would create gun-violence research center
8566	Yeah watching daigo throw to rich celebs would be so hype	Can we get a series of nothing but Daigo fighting rappers? Kayne vs. Daigo would be so hype.
8567	Is Weddle too small to play ILB?	Burnett and Dix are younger and are always getting better. No point in bringing him in.
8568	Does happen to be very cinematic though.	well that was anticlimactic
8569	it's worth every penny we out here looking flee af	Never bought Supreme saw ebay prices $100+ plain tshirt with a logo what's the draw here is it worth it?
8570	Yes, Its way better using an aimbot, It beats the stupid need for having a mouse and makes you the true Trickshotter you always wanted to be	Or aiming. Aiming works too.
8571	holy shit what a pathetic way to spin the situation.	If you're going to fire assholes are you firing Richard Lewis and Thooorin too?
8572	How did you ever survive, much less avoid committing a mass murder?	I'm using this a lot today... My first DGU was when I was 14. I was babysitting younger sibs and the children of my parents' friend. I was trained, I was trusted, and I was successful. The weapon in question was a 1911 Colt Combat Commander in .45acp. I'm glad it wasn't the first time I'd ever held it.
8573	What rank in league are you now?	532k monkfish on Ironman
8574	It's a good thing Bathesda has always had shitty DLCs with poor quality to give us a good reason to doubt them.	I am also unwilling to pay $30 for things that don't exist yet and can't be assessed for quality.
8575	Hilarious and original.	Just found this image on a forum. It's definitely a Fallout 4 spoiler. (Spoiler)
8576	But genetics have massively changed since the school and desks were built!	Can you imagine the media shit storm if a college administrator told this student to lose weight to fit in the desks though?
8577	No!	Sarcasm.
8578	An even BETTER excuse to ruin your skis!	Maybe the skis were rented.
8579	he was obviously vetted better than Obama people think Obama wasn't a citizen or a Muslim and all that wouldn't have happened had he been vetted better.	Ben Carson claims he is being vetted more thoroughly than previous candidates. Is there any way to assess this claim objectively?
8580	Incercam ceva diferit de clasicul	De ce ai scris ':p'? Aceasta sintaxa eu nu o recunosc.
8581	Ahh Brazil, the Germanic Protestant giant of South America.	Protestant too.
8582	Well clearly you deserve it.	But then the men will literally rape me!
8583	She's actually 100 now, this video is 7 years old.	Nice title. She says that she is 93 years old in like the first 10 seconds of the video. Sigh...
8584	Yeah cuz when a **black** person kills multiple people its not a **mass shooting**, that's only for **white** people so the liberals can talk shit about those "racist redneck school shooters".	you joke, but there are lots of things cops can do with stats. for example, any shooting that involves more than one person can be considered a mass shooting and not a murder.
8585	Danger zone!	Brett! If you're alive, don't move!
8586	Yea, cuz his performance against SKT and EDG weren't good at all	his stats are padded from stomping the worse team at Worlds for two games. Take out BKT games and go look at his stats. that like saying Mash is an amazing adc because he had like a double digit kda in challenger scene.
8587	Oh yeah, no shit, damn everytime I see a cop hes fucking shooting at me.	The alternative is admitting we pay a gang to 'protect' us, and they occasionally end up shooting us for no reason. It's too threatening to our sense of safety.
8588	Borat really brought kazahkstan into the main stream though bro!	Yeah but when you hear Kazakhstan what do you really think of? Mongolia. Kazakhstan is like Mongolia's lesser known brother. Not a lot of people know it even exists.
8589	Ok trick senpai	i now stream minecraft
8590	So what are the other categories?	Please tell me where I stated that the subreddit was populated *completely* by the aforementioned categories.
8591	It would have to be installed at everyone's faucet since the source of the lead is the city piping, not the water source.	Would a reverse osmosis system eliminate any issues?
8592	I don't even think I've used the market in a campaign before	I've taken over 4 hours for certain campaigns... Yeah, I'm really bad. I generally just wait until the AI takes pity on me and starts doing stupid things like not trading at the market when all the resources are gone.
8593	Keep your booger hook off the bang switch until you're ready to fire.	Firearm safety. Respect the weapon, it was literally designed to kill people
8594	Can you into grammar?	So he became bitch made,
8595	Just OTA?	Where did you get the MM rom from? Mine is starting to slow down a lot and could use a reset. Upgrading it might make the time worth while.
8596	Luckily, donated organs are not affected by how much an idiot the donor was.	1. This is awesome. 2. People will die.

8603	He's saying that just because you have your shield equipped doesn't mean you're 100% covering your whole body	So if the enemy is aiming at my shield, i should get shot and thats all right with you? Then whats the point of using a shield again?
8604	HoM Aromor looks fantastic, took a little effort to get it but perfect for alts!	What you mean you don't want to have ALL TRENCHCOATS ALL DAY for medium armour? You look cool and mysterious! I kid, mostly, but I do find Medium armour to be the most terribly samey group of armour, except for a few special gems (the armor you get for Hall of Monuments comes to mind.)
8605	We call that a hard drive hot swap in this instance Hah.	The sharp edges of the disc makes it even more painful. Then again, she could do a C-section and that would be easy since its so thin you just have to pull it out of the ~~slot~~ slit
8606	There was also a discussion about how the owners quoted were terrible to work for on Reddit.	Saw an article the other day about how louisville was short workers for all the restaurants opening.

8613	thats blading brilliant	Good Conor and Nate impression
8614	But Conor had to go all the way from lightweight to welterweight on just TWO WEEKS NOTICE!	I mean Diaz didn't even have a fucking camp so any little disadvantage Conor has goes out of the window into irrelevance
8615	Thank	doot doots
8616	That is fantastically dickish.	I ordered 2 different types of pepperoni on a pizza. They stacked them instead of spreading them out.
8617	Hellboy	What are some good comic books based on horror movies? (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Aliens, etc.)
8618	Said another Wall Street mouthpiece...	Sanders Veers Off Into Fantasyland
8619	Yeah I currently have a case that holds about a hundred or two CDs	Yeah it's great to be able to use an iPod or MP3 player instead and not have to be limited to how many CDs can fit in the car.
8620	You ignore state's habit of completely forgetting how to play basketball in 2nd halves.	With our defense, the only way we have a chance is when Ingram and Allen are going off. Come back, Amile! You can have my foot.
8621	It's also his job to see this was a likely scenario when implementing the policy.. Businesses are greedy, this should have been planned for	The horrible irony is that they likely made it 30 hours instead of 40 to avoid the "39 hour ceiling" effect. So employers just went to a 29-hour ceiling. There was a similar issue with a law California passed recently for certain kinds of in-home care workers. They basically got rid of an exemption that had previously allowed companies that hire personal care providers to not pay them overtime for working over 40 hours per week. This was actually a good thing for most workers, since it's not a terribly high-paying job, and it's fairly slow most of the time. Some of these jobs even include sleep time - that is, you sleep at the client's house, just in case they need you during the night. So many of these folks are getting 60-80 hours a week. When they passed that law, suddenly people started getting their hours slashed left and right, since many of these agencies receive a fixed amount of funding and can't possibly afford to pay overtime. It was a massive middle-finger to the workers, even though it was supposedly a "worker protection" measure. I'm about as pro-Union and pro-worker as you can get, but this was a textbook case of unintended consequences.
8622	Damn Wittman must've really pumped them up in that locker room	Wizards vs. Pistons Hope Randy gets hit in the face with a basketball this game
8623	Yep that's totally because the tampons were free	They tried this in an innercity school in my city. They had to get rid of the free access because girls where plugging toilets, littering, leaving bloody tampons all over the place and clogging sinks...
8624	Title of the post uses the present tense, which would preclude this being a discussion about food history.	I think OP is speaking historically, not currently.
8625	That's not really true... Last time we stickied the suicide hotline...	We wouldn't troll them. It's very low energy.
8626	GET OUT OF MY HEAD	I've watched enough japanese porn to know that already
8627	That seems odd	Would rather keep Embiid, Saric and Okafor than trade them for Boogie.
8628	I didn't think i needed to put	No make up is by far Kendrick's worst song imho
8629	Not really.	That's sounds so good but I guess the real question is do I need to make it stable in prime95 to be sure it's rock solid
8630	lol okay bud	You are either trolling or have no idea how hockey is played.
8631	It seems to be back up now	Dude..what the fuck? Seriously? I just fuckin woke up. This is fucking stupid. I'm done.
8632	If you take into account that many companies that are doing this are also part of *your* 401K or IRA then you also benefit.	It really is hard to get angry at corporations that do this. Let's be honest for 1 minute, if you could lower your tax burden by 5000 dollars a year, wouldn't you do it? Of course you would. Everyone would. Be angry at the countries and tax laws that let shit like this happen.
8633	This is why I think "debunking" threads ought to be banned.	If you don't agree with the theory OR that people should be allowed to even discuss it then you are the closed minded unscientific one. Your concerns are noted, you know where the rest of the internet is.

8636	ive always wondered what the people that are around them are thinking.	Mildly cringy
8637	There have been times where I cook rice with less water and fry it right away and it never stuck as much as this time.	Try 24 hours next time, that seems on the light side.

8639	Your humor triggers me	It's supposed to be ironic. Have a little humor.
8640	I just can't respect any rule called the "Buster Posey" rule.	Utley's slide at home being labeled a "take out slide" by a ton of sports outlets. Ridiculous.
8641	IKR, not like its one of the most important jobs out there or anything...	JUST a high school/middle school teacher?? SMH
8642	yeah poor Porsche people, let's start a charity for them.	The way I heard it was that Porsche, family owned, had been trying to buy out VWG for years. They were leveraging loans against the value of VWG shares and all was going smoothly, Porsche building up toward a majority share in VWG. About a year or so before that was due to happen the economic crises occurred, and suddenly Porsche were leveraged too high, thus making their debt a liability and leaving them vulnerable to a buy out. And who better to buy them out than VWG? It was not poor management at Porsche, but rather the unforeseen economic collapse of the banking industry that left them exposed, but anyway the plan backfired with the opposite result of Porsche's plans happening. Unfortunate for the Porsche people who not only didn't get VW, but lost their majority share in the family business to boot.
8643	I have but I'm always looking for more so if you have a list or something send it my way	Have you found what you need already? PM me if not!
8644	Yeah you can if you want i think it depends alot on the overall fit	Yeah, and make sure your shirt isn't too long? Gotta advertise those added inches (rise).

8650	Are you really jewish, would never have guessed	I wouldn't say "just so happens" but yeah, I shouldn't have left out the fact that this can be a symbol of Israeli pride, not just Jewish pride.
8651	Good riddance.	Nobody cares
8652	Though, that's something you'll be using for *the rest of the game*, so it is a worthwhile investment in the end.	I paid 50k for Eorlund Gray-Mane to upgrade my TG Master armour from standard to Masterwork.
8653	Why not telegram?	Well the name is not just "portation", but rather "holoportation", we can be interpreted as "transporting" a "hologram" across distance, which is exactly what that device is doing since it's transmitting a hologram in real time across a network.

8662	Yeah, because someone who yesterday bought the game needs to constantly be matched against plats and lvl 100+, that's fair.	Ive seen this on other games to know that this is why people dislike SBMM. The top players, like streamers, for destiny could matchmake for 45 minutes and the get a match with players around the world that was so laggy it was impossible to play (destiny is p2p). On top of that, it was aggressively skill based so every match was super sweaty. Which that's the issue with SBMM. Oh, you've got a 1.15 k/d? Youre *obviously* pubstomping with stats like that so we will progressively force you to lose about half your matches until we can *artificially* cram your stats down to 1.0. Also, if you have played the game two weeks, you "deserve" the same stats as experienced players who had to work hard to improve and we will progressively matchmake you against worse and worse players until you're playing children so we artificially make you a 1.0 as well. Everyone's stats should be the same. Otherwise, it's obviously *oppression* if someone is above a 1.0 (is beating the aggregate community just slightly more than if beats him/her).
8663	Massive crit chance/base crit chance/multi, can't be any strong builds with those kinda things	Are there any strong/interesting Assassin builds? I have a trickster and a sabateur (both around 90) on PHC and I figured that I'd try out assassin. But compared to the other shadow paths, assassin just seems lack luster. What are some HC viable assassin builds that you guys have been enjoying?

8683	No you're a fucking campsr if you stay in the goal	This is hilarious, but I don't get why people see this as an issue in the first place. It's a play style- A defensive one, to be precise. You can easily keep control of the ball, and if they're just sitting in goal, that just allows you to push farther up. It just seems like there are a lot of people that don't know how to cope with a defensive opposition in 1s. It isn't objectively better or worse than playing aggressively; It's just different.

A moving target is very difficult to shoot period. On top of that throw in the officer having tons of adrenaline and heavy breathing. Lastly, they have done a lot of studying on the subject of a suspect with a knife and found that up to 21 feet away, the suspect and charge and stab the officer before he has time to react and shoot. Oh and also it's no less deadly to Shoot center mass than legs or arms really. A headshot is the only truly shoot to kill spot.

8728	Oh, I absolutely ADORED running Seige of Orgrimmar for a straight year.	The problem is that the community is demanding the release schedule of a subscription MMO even though it's been known for awhile now that the old dlc model was unsustainable. People keep insisting they want inferior content more regularly rather than high quality content less frequently. I mean, for fucks sake, it's been 4 months, not 8. I've seen content gaps in wow last for 12-16 months and that game is sub based. This community just expects too much and part of those expectations were set by year 1 dlc releases but anyone with half a brain can see that if those dlcs were already in development when vanilla launched and they were still as average as they were, that can't mean good things for what a completely new dlc would be like if dropped this month. I

8734	Date her after you get a vasectomy?	Thank you, I appreciate it. I know that we aren't going to work out, and it sucks. What makes it worse, is that she still wants to date me. She's told me she still wants to be my girlfriend. But at the same time, she states that she knows I'm serious about not wanting kids. So, I think she really does want to be with me, but she still thinks or hopes that I'll change my mind about them. Which is making this whole thing worse.

8740	If you're going to go through that much work, then you might as well just mod them in with the dev menu.	There is an easier way, but you need two people to do it. Basically, get a drop (or multiple drops, or any other item), sleep to save your game, alt-tab out of the game, backup the save files, go back into the game, drop the packages and have the other person pick them up. Alt-F4 to quit, restore the saves with the backup, start up the game and connect and then you will have whatever you dropped, but so will the other person. Keep repeating until you have as many as you need. It's a bit tedious, but it works.

8755	Get out of here you... with all your logic... and junk.	Just calm a notch about the incoming changes I am tired to see pleople complaining about the incoming changes, mainly the Kill/Assist stats and the game performance evaluation. Come on people, the changes are not here yet, you dont know if they are going to be good or bad, try then first. Dont start saying with will generate toxicity/bad behaviors. Toxic player were toxic and will keep being toxic, the new stats are not generating extra toxicity, ok they can complain about one extra item, but they were going to complain anyway because they are assholes. Last hit can give you a stat but that is not really important, you will get the same xp, the team gets the same xp, all get happy as always, its only a stat. About the performance evaluation, I see people saying things like, what if we simulate a good game for the game thinking that we were the MVP but we really were not... What if I just play to farm the game kill more, die less, get more xp, more siege, more damage... FFS if you do this then you are really the MVP you were playing better. And also we dont know how the system will work stop saying that it will be bad. Any way I see this system as a way to make you lose less rank points if you lose and you were great and your team sucked. If after we get this changes they are proved to be bad I am pretty sure that Blizz will reverse them (as they are probably going to re-include the xp stat by the community request). Until then please stop on ways to fixing something that we do not know if it is broken or not. **TLDR**: Stop the paranoia give Blizzard some credit they know what they do, and when they do it wrong they are not afraid to rollback decisions.
8756	Yeah, but that will never work; they have similar cultural values and religious compositions, they tend to be bilingual, they're nearby... we better just go ahead and start training these illiterates (don't yell at me; the majority of them *are* functionally illiterate) to drive our high tech manufacturing sector.	and frankly, with unemployment in Spain and Greece running at over 25%, as Europeans, we owe them help first. That's what freedom of movement with Schengen was supposed to remedy.

8762	Right or wrong, my university	Well clearly the rest of reddit decided to come out with their pitchforks and skewer me for speaking my mind about how awful UBC is being about this and are looking to protect them but at least it means they've read it... It's really discouraging though

8773	Mmm I'll be sure to try them out if I get the chance for sure.	I like solid state as much as anyone and I'm sure it does have a good JCM tone. But the Blackstar is real and it puts a smile on my face in a way that no digital amp ever will. The versatility is what makes it for me though, I like to be somewhere in between Vox and Fender most of the time and Blackstar as the only amps that can do it.
8774	Until the .......Pre-Precursors show up....	Eeeh, I'm fine with saving the primoridal for near the end, and the Iso-Didact as the big reveal at the end. Then in the next, and finale of the Reclaimer Saga, we finish off the primordial and the flood for good, and humanity finally accepts the mantle. That would be my ideal Halo ending. I'd also like for us to end up working with the Didact, otherwise it would be a repeat of history of us weakening eachother.

8780	So what you're telling me is computers are sexist!	And STEM is hard as fuck. The computer will never, ever, under no circumstances, no matter how mad and frustrated you get at it, do what you want. It only does what you tell it to do. So the burden is 100% on you to get it right. And most people can't. So they don't go into STEM, even though it pays well. Gee, why do you think it pays well?

8812	Cool, thanks for the tip!	Also, from Costco, you can get a "session ales" Red Racer variety 24-pack for I think about $33 incl. tax and deposit. It includes the pale ale, ISA, copper ale and white ale. It's the best beer value I have found in Calgary.
8813	On one flight his pilot passed out, and without ever doing it before he was able to fly the plane for several minutes before the pilot regained consciousness.	Rowan Atkinson or well known as Mr. Bean

8817	Current Saints RT Zach Strief was the backup T and TE on elephant for his first few years in the league.	Run a base offense with 6 lineman. If the tackle who is technically a TE is athletic enough, you could dump him in the flat every 20 or so plays. This offense would definitely be a plus in the running game, and if you invest in receivers you could do a lot of damage with all that pocket time
8818	lol 7/10 scoring is accurate	Couldn't of been more correct about those girls that have think they have superior music taste. But a lot of the bands you threw in their are actually great. 7/10 post

8828	I do this already, lol... something portable would be nice though.	You can just set a fan on the table next to your noodle soup, and hold the noddles up in the breeze. I have done it, it works almost too well.
8829	Only if you have Scholes on the left!	I bet a Gerrard/Lampard midfield would dominate world soccer for, like, a decade. Unstoppable.
8830	Scott Cartoon is best game creator	I'd watch Scott Cartoon
8831	you forgot the	The narrative is changing buddy. Momentum is shifting to Sanders and he has a very real chance to the nomination.
8832	Anchoring it to the wall with a cord might help, so that it can't be pulled out beyond the support of the fridge/wall.	Obviously a push of any kind will knock it over but I can assure you that fully loaded up it stands on its own. You only ever pull it out to grab an item momentarily before rolling it back in anyway.
8833	because you cant have a job and deal with you 70 yearold father with alzheimers that likes to take chainsaws and cut up random trees on the property, and will take cars and go out when you arent home, and not remember anything.	Why do white people put their parents in retirement homes when they get old?
8834	Just hot glue some gears to it and shop for nerdy shit	I don't think I've seen this yet, but I wish it was socially acceptable to wear outfits from past eras just because you like the style. I usually like to wear jeans and a t-shirt or sweater, but every now and then I really get the urge to put on a Victorian era gown and a parasol and just walk around the shops to look for some ribbon. I'd like to do stuff like that every once in a while without fear of people wondering if I'm in a play or if I'm just a psycho. I just like the dresses!

8841	Um... Lo siento, no hablamos ingles.	Holy shit. Is that PMI?
8842	You're absolutely right, and that's my major gripe with the show, but since we can't really remove the writing from the character and then analyze him, he's still the Sherlock that can figure out the most from the least information.	I'm not sure- Cumberbatch's Sherlock relies *heavily* on plot armor. His observations about tiny things reaching to gigantic conclusions are very plot-oriented. There are dozens of equally plausible explanations for whatever he observes but in order to drive the story line they always allow him to magically guess the exact correct one (most common blatant one off the top of my head are Watson's phone deductions)
8843	And to further clarify the situation, Porter's stick was *literally* blade down touching the ice when the Pen on Pen stick job occurred.	It was on in the restaurant I was in, but wasn't really paying attention in 1st &amp; 2nd. What happened there?

8848	No, that's just good ol' grit n' grind basketball, not like the Warriors pussy flagrant flopball.	Did Matt Barnes push h Barnes for the rebound? GD

8853	are you the anti-suarezteeth?	Any German club, really. This is a fan built idea and it's being destroyed by corporatism and capitalism. My club is MY club, not their money making scheme. The Americans don't get it because their teams are out to fleece them instead of being a CLUB. A CLUB is exactly what it says on the tin. Fuck this capitalist agenda aimed at sucking every last penny from fans and tourists. I want my fucking club back you cunts, you didn't grow up wishing you could be Carra, you grew up wishing you could roll around in money making the poor eat shit and die. And for that they're soulless cunts.
8854	4 women were murdered and 23 raped in the time it took me to read this post, misogynist.	Privilege...
8855	Well, actually	TO BE FAIR ABOUT THE SHORTS THING How many boys do you know own/have access to/wear shorts as short as the short shorts girls wear when they wear short shorts. And for that matter, how many girls do you know who actually want to see boys wear short shorts as short as the short shorts girls wear instead of regular shorts. Shorts no longer looks like a word to me. Basically, girls have more clothing styles and options, so... yeah, more outfits are going to be proscribed by any given dress code. It's the price we pay for having more options. HOWEVER. This does NOT excuse asymmetrical enforcement- i.e., if a girl gets coded for showing her shoulders, you better also be coding guys for that same violation. It is also DEFINITELY NOT OKAY to sexualize the enforcement of a dress code- so, no "You're distracting the boys!", "You're being inappropriate!", and DEFINITELY no "You're too sexy and it's making me uncomfortable" because that is just gross and wrong. And don't worry. Once you get to college, you've officially earned the right to go everywhere in your pajamas without getting weird looks, and nobody can say shit to you if you want to wear a unicorn onesie to class. It works out in the end.

It's Democrats that are pouring gasoline all over that flame. We have legislation like HR 4269 being sent to the house and Obama making his personal opinions on gun ownership clear a few days ago about how he hoped more gun stores would stop selling any semi-auto firearms.

8882	He works two full time jobs though, he can't be broke, just free......	I've reached the conclusion that this guy isn't really trying to prove any point, he's trying to get everything for free. He's trying to ride the train for free and when he's at BK he asks for his money back AND for a new order. I think he filmed it all to seem like an activist and a mad customer instead of a fucking broke deadbeat.

8886	Thanks for letting us know.	Mother 4 ... is a game that only exists through videos and footage. With each passing year, fans who await this game become more discouraged and doubtful of its release. I would have forgotten this game have I not seen it in my youtube video history. My Review: It's a game that COULD HAVE BEEN because no one released it to be what it COULD BE. And so, until it is released which is not in the foreseeable future, Mother 4 is only a collection of videos, works of what could have been on a website.
8887	Im cool with lesbians.. I dance with ellen in my livingroom	How do you feel about women wearing suits? By this, I mean traditional suits and ties like a man would wear. Is it attractive? Powerful? Weird? Annoying? Any of your thoughts on this would be nice.

8935	That's the America I know and love	I spoke to a group of homeless guys who live in a culvert down the street from my mom's house. 3 out of 4 of them were veterans. Young guys, probably in their 30s. Seemed to be on drugs, or looking for drugs, definitely living the hard life. What this country does to its veterans is disgusting. Lies get them into wars that benefit no one but billionaires, and then they get chewed up and spit out into the city streets for the rest of us to deal with.

8942	But but muh immersion	As someone who loves slow paced shooters and mil sims, theres nothing more annoyingly cringe inducing than people commenting "...the game should change this because in real life [insert dick waving knowledge drop]" or "this gun has a different caliber as this one so therefore [insert suggestion that completely disregards game balance]". Video games are video games, moving a mouse/joystick is never going to be "realistic". Simply do what makes a game more fun; i'm glad Ubisoft Montreal are doing that.

8951	What's the advantage of a hybrid over a "normal mech mod?"	You need to know if you are responsible enough to own a mech with a hybrid connector. If your RDAs don't have 510 pins long enough, or you don't trust yourself to check, get a "normal mech mod" that has a 510 connector instead of the hybrid (where the atty touches the battery directly). Assuming you know about building in general, the other big thing is the amp limits of your batteries and Ohms law.

I tried it with firestorm and ball lightning 100% lightning to fire to get as many ignites as fast as possible. It runs in to the problem in that if you get enough ignites on something, it's already dead and you don't need the ignites. It did have niche coolness like a rare mob in the middle of a pack would get like 30 ignite prolifs on a single ball lightning pass through and melt.

8961	I am sure his love can "cure" her of those pesky gay feels.	Pretty sure she was gay but otherwise they're a perfect match.
8962	The pad thing, I don't see being real, the band's however seem very plausable.	Sony will Launch Wearable Gaming Bands and Gaming Pad with Its PlayStation VR
8963	They have perfected telekinesis?	Scientists in China have come up with a more futuristic method of getting from A to B. Using special mind-reading headgear, their new car can be made to move forward and backwards using nothing more than a few concentrated thoughts.
8964	Abuse them too much and the effects are irreversible (Andreas Krieger)	Essentially, yes. For men, injecting exogenous testosterone causes the body to aromatize excess test to estrogen (there are drugs to reduce the estrogen though). Using steroids at a higher body fat % only compounds the aromatization. For women, all steroids run the risk of developing permanent side effects. However, running steroids that are highly androgenic increases the risk of abnormal body hair growth, enlarging of the clitoris, and deepening of the voice.
8965	I'm not even mad.	The Enhanced Fujita Scale didn't come into effect until 2007. So at the time it was just an F2 tornado.
8966	Hey, you're alright, too!	I like you
8967	Christensen has been playing great for Gldbach	Christensen and our Dutch lads, Nathan, Izzy Brown (who I think is injured), Solanke, and Luis Baker. I've heard Baker in particular is doing well.
8968	You guys still paying Bonilla?	Overpaid: Bobby Bonilla Underpaid: Too many to pick one from
8969	So that would be a... trinity of films	And in the third film, he rose again.
8970	Malygos is the quintessential one for me.	What cards being used, immediately give away you're about to lose?
8971	You forgot the	What a new and refreshing post. This is awesome! I've never seen this before! Congrats on making it!
8972	You ever see a rabbit with glasses?	So are carrots good for your eye sight?
8973	To be fair, we spotted them 17 points AND didn't run any meaningful offense until the 4th quarter.	TIL we're shit
8974	How is punishing other redditors "standing up for yourself"	Maybe, but Reddit is standing up for itself and even it goes down reddit will go down kicking and screaming its core beliefs
8975	That brown is a little too purply for me.	I call this pudding supreme. great desert at the Asian buffet.
8976	so doesn't context	No one said "safer". He said not as dangerous. Words have meanings
8977	Yeah, because living in Mexico is worse than slavery and abuse.	Wow I bet they never thought of that! Or wait! Could it be that their lives in Mexico are worse or more dangerous? No way! Things are always black and white, right?
8978	UPDATE: I'll be at Helium on July 29th (Wednesday), working on booking some other shows.	You going to be doing any stand up while you're in town?
8979	So then, tell me when these outlets have been unfairly negative in a review about a AMD product.	I'm saying your argument is flawed. They're withholding review units from outlets that have been unfairly negative in the past, that is NOT the same as 'forcing' anybody to do anything.
8980	Only someone with no morals like Stephen would steal Savage's clothes like that.	Guess who's been raiding Savage's closet?
8981	Going through life knowing there is an afterlife would be great, I could probably sleep at night	To you, what does it mean to be "living the dream"?
8982	Mettaton spinoff rhythm game pls.	I think Toby would be down to make Undertale Heaven
8983	flair checks out	Are you tired of the RNG47? I've got a product you'll absolutely love!
8984	Thanks, but I got the idea from someone else.	You are wise.
8985	That's not how diplomacy works.	Putin said on a valdai Meeting : if the West playes its games without rules (which they do), then there will be the game without rules again! so yes, why should russia play by UN rules if noone else does?
8986	Probably want subway and Usaa stop giving him money	When will we accept that he is shit and done?
8987	Because liberal = democrat, duh.	But the conservatives don't care, because democrats are the racist ones because of an ideology they supported 100 years ago. Someone needs to google "Southern Strategy".
8988	She has a fairly masculine personality that isn't much of a turn on if you're into femininity.	You are a fucking liar if you think you wouldn't bang Miley Cyrus.
8989	Felt like saying this to every liberal this week..	Maybe You Should Care About Black People as Much As You Care About Cecil The Lion
8990	No idea where you get 5 years from, because you get until the child's first birthday (JSA6 exemption), speaking from past experience.	It's more than just child benefit. They get the equivalent of JSA without having to do any of the job hunting for 5 years. Stress-free living with a guaranteed income and accommodation for half a decade.
8991	WHY ARE YOU SUPPORTING THE WAR ON CHRIST	Figured somebody could use this gif right now.
8992	Bring moisturizer, roger.	Skin=dried up like a raisin
8993	one betel addiction later	Yeah, the red spit everywhere is unfortunate. It makes me curious too though, might try it some day just to see.
8994	No, there will be ways to obtain equally powerful gear through pvp	Yeah I heard that but does that mean I'm gonna have to do PVE content that I don't want to do?
8995	"The Love Shack" by the B-52's sprung into my mind as 'mis-heard' lyrics ...	Amish on the highway.
8996	Wolf confirmed	Huh... now Octoling has a Brush weapon, their own gun usable, and their gear... oh, and their models got updated, I wonder what THIS means...
8997	Or	Oh, my bad, I forgot to put that in the proper font so people would realize it was a joke.
8998	HahahahHahaha	This year, I began living alone for the first time. This is my Christmas card.
8999	I'll just take a little swig out of the bottle instead	Not yet. Hey said return to Vic. So that has 10 possible results.
9000	I was in marching band, it's typically not super physically taxing because you stop and start a lot, but you still end up walking a lot to and from places in the show as well as the actual run-through.	I don't know what level of exercise marching band qualifies as, but fair enough.
9001	How is it not a nerf?	The engie changes seem mostly about the wrangler really. I don't necessarily think it's a nerf, more of a side-change.
9002	The stove?	The element at the top of the oven where you can grill things?
9003	He also forgot to mention he played for the Flyers, the gooniest of goons	You seem upset. Hug it out?
9004	So, uh, he'll be good for the bowl game then, right?	Corey Coleman undergoes successful surgery
9005	But why does it matter... The hat does essentially nothing...	People are Cheating with Wildstalker_helmet @ Mage arena. Please Either Delete the hood entirely or Patch this
9006	Its faster than his McLaren.	Formula 1 driver goes go karting.
9007	Actually they were 75 gold not priceless	I really miss being able to purchase sight wards. Wards use to be such a priceless asset to my games, and now this yellow trinket is doing a underwhelming job of replacing them. Being able to buy them meant I could get as many as I felt I needed and expend them how I like, but now they are restricted to two at most and on a cooldown. Now if I want to ward my lane I can't protect myself from facechecking, I can't consistently ward other areas or deem which wards I no longer need and can replace. Obviously sight stone doesn't fit in to every role's build path, too. Can anyone share how they've adapted their playstyle to cope with this? I'm having a hard time.
9008	Shut your fucking face, uncle fuckah!	I'm not your buddy, friend!
9009	I know that when I'm around police I feel more uncomfortable and unsafe then I do around criminal and thug types when I'm out in shitty neighbor hoods doing pest control.	The guy they were trying to stop from buying a gun might have gone on to kill more shitbirds like himself... But in trying to stop him the police killed a completely innocent man. How ironic that is. It makes me question who I'm more afraid of; the criminal who harms other criminals or the police who harm anybody who crosses them.
9010	Maybe that's been their plan all along, so they don't have to take any calls	Shot 7 times... Yeeees... "accident"... Seriously, people in the US should stop calling the cops. People will just die.
9011	honestly I think collections of his songs are more cohesive than a lot of great albums but I agree with you	Any rapper will tell you there's a difference between being a good rapper and being able to cultivate that into a full project
9012	nah man design a play where your center gets shit on every play and be successful all coaches do it	Everyone gameplans in theory. A lot of problems on the o-line this year stem from the fact that there is no successful game plan for when your starting center gets blown off the line every snap and your guards are constantly getting beat. Similarly, the only successful gameplan for Dennis Kelly is to be playing against him.
9013	Of course not, they outsource that kind of work.....	But at least they're not massacring people and dumping their bodies in shallow pits
9014	just like IRL	I bet he stays right around 140k. He's not crazy good.
9015	Id like to get in her chat...	Hypocrite
9016	Nailed it	I take it that the top picture shows how far a PC gamer can walk before having to stop and rest and the bottom picture shows how far a console gamer could go?
9017	aladeen*	No.
9018	It was also obvious feminist propaganda	Nah, man, it didn't have enough character development, the action wasn't impressive (I didn't see one CGI alien!) and it was about a GIRL even though the movie is called MAD MAX. DURR!!!!! Needless to say I was deeply impressed by this movie in the same way you were, and I really think anyone who can't even appreciate it a little bit probably has awful taste. But eh.
9019	This +1 Ive seen a few times that theyve done this	sometimes they cut to those cams in the middle of a fight though, it can be really annoying at times
9020	In fairness, renting out the house your parents bought you, and downsizing to a sensible car and pocketing the difference is probably the most financially responsible way of mooching off your parents.	Ah yes, the old "mooch off your rich parents" scheme. It's a foolproof way for anyone to make money.
9021	Is there a legitimate source quote for marijuana legalization or is this just exaggeratively referencing his "open to it" position?	Bernie Sanders - 'Abolish Private Prisons, Legalize Marijuana at the Federal Level'
9022	You know complaining about women not fucking you is the reason why you're single.	Trust me its too late for me. If by age of 30 I've never been able to have sex or a relationship I never will. Trp is right about somethings but they are wrong in how they manipulate women.
9023	A tonsil stone	What's the most disgusting thing that's been in your mouth?
9024	Well I guess if you aren't getting sick, it is probably fine then.	Just my doctor, who I haven't seen in about ten years, because that was the last time I got sick.
9025	that at least makes sense, sort of.	I live in the North and I know of a cemetery that has rebel rags on the graves of confederate POWs that died in a mill accident.
9026	Retro	My car is a 1997...
9027	To protect the children of course	Why are there so many parents on a College Humor site?
9028	Oh yeah, I can see that working out for him like it did with George Rose.	Come to Melbourne Willy. Bellamy will get you to your best
9029	That's very fair.	We also have a Honda to trade it that will be scrapped. It has 220,000 miles on it. They've offered 400 to 800 dollars.
9030	Yeah right, no redditor can go 3 days without their phone.	Phone dropped in bath tub, 3 days in white rice works perfect
9031	Wasn't Lawson out?	I thought I saw Lawson out there getting burned a lot in the Nickel, maybe that is where the negative went to?
9032	How about other relevant stories?	People love him. What do you want? More Walker, Trump, or Benghazii links?
9033	ITT: People who aren't thinking of the children.	Yep. Has nothing to do with MMA. It's not performance enhancing whatsoever, so wtf. War on drugs needs to end. Especially for stuff like this. The MMA bit is just a small part of it of course, but it that decision were to be reversed, might get some extra publicity from it and do good.
9034	Or you could just delete it from your 3DS.	Literally unplayable, delete it from the e-shop Nicalis
9035	You sure it's not just the fact that Chicago has strict gun laws?	The problem here in Chicago is certainly multifaceted. Our public schools are joke. The court system is a joke. Judges here in Cook County will I-bond (no money posted to get out of jail) to self admitted gang members arrested for possessing a firearm. Then you have our wonderful governor cutting funding to mental health clinics and job outreach programs that serve the poor. But what really pulls at the short and curlies is when you see on the morning news that a 7 y/o was killed and they cut to the "local activist" who says the standard boilerplate response "we as the community need step up and say enough is enough" only to find out that the boys dad is a high ranking gang member who was the target of that bullet and that he is REFUSING to cooperate with the police investigation. I understand our state and local system here in Illinois is not the best, but fixing the war zone that is the southside needs more than just lip service from residents just as much as it needs political reform.
9036	Stupid sexy kids...	Child victims partly to blame in priest sex-abuse cases, Syracuse bishop testified
9037	Lets be realistic here.	Get off Reddit for 6 hours? Just saying ;)
9038	The key is to replace them with unqualified "teachers," not to get the real teachers to work better.	Because fucking teachers in the ass will really make them work better right? Or you know take away money from them so they can't effectively teach and then demonize them for not teaching effectively. Fuck off Sam.
9039	Oh well I guess they saw the error in their ways and will change now.	Turing Pharmaceuticals to Lower Price of The Toxoplasmosis Drug "Daraprim" amid Controversy
9040	It's terrorist pride!	not the ponyfags nooo
9041	You were obviously transfered to Kirin Tor, welcome back on Algalon.	Have the whole server to myself with this gymer's buddy buff There isn't anything anywhere, except for the npcs required for the quest "the storm kings vengeance" Server crashed mid quest and i still had the Gymer's Buddy Buff on me. With no Gymer to be found anywhere. tried ice blocking right clicking re-logging. nothing worked. and now I'm in Dalaran with no Npcs players or anything. else.
9042	Yeah, because so far government services have made everything they control better...	Why would they put in a middleman that would diminish profits? Just make it a government service...
9043	But if we encourage for-profit lenders for high school, that'll create sooo many jobs at those lenders!	So we can do to public schools what privatization has done to the university system and the American healthcare system. Priced them out of reach of average working people. Can you imagine graduating high school with student loans?
9044	Or a drone-hunting unit, either the cops impounding unlicensed drones, corp-sec disabling/tracking illicit drone activities, or a new illgal extreme sport started by some kids documenting their exploits on a pirate trid-station.	you could do a ghost in the shell-ish campaign. A unit specialized on fighting cyber-crimes
9045	Yes...	Ben are you recording this?
9046	Dude metrothuggin is coming out in no time at all there's no way this one could get delayed.	can't wait for this to come out in two years
9047	But why would someone lie on the internet?	I don't think that's him.
9048	TIL...	808 is a style of kick drum that has a long, extended bass release time. It got its name from the Roland 808 drum machine that synthesized kick drums with an ADSR and that style got pretty popular... Popular enough for it to forever coin the term "808" amongst producers. And this isn't just "edm vocabulary" it's in every producer's vocabulary. Kanye West's had an album called 808's and Heartbreak.
9049	Indeed no one said he had to take the 17.	No one's saying you have to take 17 up there. You can take 87 and Lake Mary Rd, probably less traffic that way too. It is 30 minutes longer, but if you're riding your motorcycle, the views are probably better anyway.
9050	We get it, you vape.	The dude that fixes my stuff at my local vape shop and I both have the brony wallet with RD on it :)
9051	sammy pups have the best ears, they look like balls of cotton	Say hello to McDog, Mac for short!!! We brought him home yesterday :)
9052	But TANF, isn't that the program that welfare queens use to get their obamaphones?	Very worrying that this is coming out of TANF funding, a program whose enrollment has been decimated by the state shooing people off the rolls. Take away much needed aid, give it to religious whackos that provide nothing of actual value.
9053	Yeah but load bearing vests are mean and scary looking	Every longtime officer I've met has a severe case of duck butt, if nothing else, from poor posture due to the belt. The upsetting part is that we know how to prevent this, a load bearing vest of some sort.
9054	It's going to come out within the next week.	Valve accidentally made it so they have to wait 90 days to gift it to you.
9055	If she gave you her Tumblr url, she did it for a reason.	So what makes her think that Tumblr is an appropriate website to use as a professional reference or as a portfolio. It doesn't have anything to do with the stuff they post as it does with the fact that they don't grasp that tumblr isn't appropriate for a resume. That would be like me listing my Karma on an application.
9056	I know god's real because the bible says he is	Checkmate, atheists. Here is proof of God.
9057	Absolutely love the bass line in "Long View" by Green Day	What song do you think has absolutely the best fucking bass guitar sound? Bass sound that makes you shiver, flows into every dark corner of your body, sound that makes you wanna jump around and tell everybody how awesome they are.
9058	Your statement contains no facts.	It isn't. We have refineries as it is, new ones make little sense.
9059	I don't know man, I don't think this sub could go a single day without posting this yet again.	OH GEE this definitely hasn't been posted a million times already.
9060	100% sure that is Largo,right,Tazer,or should I say Largo Johnson?	Don't want to say my actual name because of reasons, but I do actually share the exact name with someone in the franchise
9061	As long as you drove home its fine!	Ya I took like 7 beer cups home from the game I'm gonna die
9062	Yes, the fact that the Bucs got penalized 16 times is evidence that the refs were biased, not that the Bucs committed a lot of penalties that game	LMAO The refs all but handed that game to the Skins and he is acting like he destroyed the Bucs I think the Bucs ended with 16 penalties which is ridiculous slanted.
9063	Don't forget he was in a Nazi concentration camp as child!	Sometimes, when your pregnant wife gets murdered by the Manson family the Academy throws you a bone a couple decades later for avoiding a statutory rape conviction. It's a by-law I believe.
9064	Such a great second place effort.	Saulo Ribeiro Highlight from Master World Championships
9065	and then no one would buy it and then you have no problem right!	Then charge appropriately. If a mojito takes three times as long as a regular drink, charge three times as much. This isn't rocket science.
9066	None of my friends or people I meet even believe me when I tell them this movie exists	Return to Oz Turns 30: A loving tribute to the scariest children's movie of all time
9067	ESPN didn't even replay this too	Jason Terry Breaks Stephen Curry's Ankles
9068	My teams	What's keeping YOU from advancing to your next rank? I'm writing this as I fell from Plat 2 to 3 after a 5 game loss streak. I looked at the games and thought, "Well the games I didn't get mid were an automatic loss." then I looked at all of my games and thought why I loss them. 2 I lost because we had a dc/afk in them. Couldn't do anything about that. 4 of them I fed 0/4, 2/5, 3/6, 2/6. Those losses weren't my team's fault alone but mine too (mainly mine and not theirs). 4 of those games I threw by being out of position when warding, team fighting and laning in general. So because of this I played a lot safer and positioned behind my tanks for once and won a game with only 3 deaths. So what are some mistakes YOU make that keep you from climbing and how will you fix those?
9069	But they ruined game of thrones	Please for the love of D&amp;D subscribe to their channel
9070	Rules page is currently protesting admins	Rules link: forbidden?
9071	No, I believe it's: - State's rights - State's rights - State's rights - State's rights - State's rights Not necessarily in that order.	Slavery, treason, murder, rape, ignorance; not necessarily in that order.
9072	Yeah, because everyone who trains in martial arts watches UFC	If you were a fighter you'd know the backstory to this and wouldn't be talking shit. JS.
9073	Such a good song...only listen 100 more times to it on the radio before it gets boring!	SHUT UP AND DANCE WITH ME! Fuck my life...
9074	Nope.	Did the cure fix it?
9075	"But trade wizards!"	That's the overrated Bergevin for you.
9076	But then how are people going to argue that Solo affecting Powerplay isn't a completely asinine idea then?	Really IMO Solo should have been that for moment like these.
9077	but neckbeards are supposed to be good at vidya	Men who harass women online are literally losers, new study finds
9078	If only we had some sort of electrical means of communication to let other drivers know if we in fact *are* or *are not* turning.	It looks like you're slowing down to turn into the mall. Kinda the drivers fault but still stupid on the other drivers part too.
9079	So, the normal servers?	I like the idea of forcing them to play on a server where they die randomly to stupid shit. Subject them to their own medicine.
9080	I knew Cesaro in the main event was a bad news	Raw ratings up, but big drop at the end
9081	well you see, feminism is evil because AWALT and is a method for fooling betas into having hot sox with them and sex positivism is a promise of lots of sex if they accept feminism	Yeah... I really don't understand how he came to that conclusion.
9082	paul blart	If you could tell Reddit to shut the hell up about one thing forever, what would it be?
9083	as long as you submitted it, it's fair game	Can I still use my top speed bot, defense bot, offense bot, and am I still allowed to ddos my opponents?
9084	Yeah furi, THD, and Fourzero were the only ini people	So scared to fight the DIG platoon they accualy quit Planetside. We will miss you so very much :(
9085	ecksdee lololol dankmeme	BRO LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL xd
9086	Oh WOOT!	Osaka University scientists said they fired the world's most powerful laser beam: It instantaneously concentrated energy equivalent to 1,000 times the world's electricity consumption and entered the record books as the most powerful laser beam ever emitted.
9087	YESS, THIS SUB IS MAKING A COMEBACK	Apple really have run out of ideas...
9088	They knew you wanted to catch that train so they got rid of it!	Oh, Sydney Trains, *fuck you* for cancelling my train and delaying my commute home by half an hour, and having the gall to say "oh everything is OK".
9089	Shut up with all your reasonable assessments, this does nothing for the narrative that Benning shipped out a star.	He looked like shit in Utica, but I'm fairly certain that's because he just didn't want to be here. Didn't really go into corners, was going at a minor and a half a game before the playoffs, half assed skating and getting beat outside.
9090	Sometimes Sharia law doesn't sound so bad.	Columbia student accused of rape amends lawsuit to include 'the mattress attends graduation'
9091	This.	Yeah honestly. I love this site and I love its users, but I can't stand its hive mind and echo chamber tendencies.
9092	They should edit out foreskin on penises too.	Labiaplasty - The Australian Classification Board decides what vaginas must look like in soft porn. If a vagina has excess tissue it may be labelled as "offensive", so porn companies must digitally edit or remove parts of the labia, leading to only one type of vagina see in porn magazines (2010)
9093	Yeah, doncha know when you huff the chemicals in nail polish it alters your brain and makes you like men?	MFW someone says I'm going to turn my toddler gay because I painted his fingernails (when he asked me to)
9094	Yeah, because it has nothing to do with the overall global oil and gas economy whatsoever.	THANKS NDP!
9095	They do this by checking your phone's front camera to determine if you were paying attention to the ad or not.	Those don't count. Google is able to tell they're mis-clicks and no one gets paid from them. Also, even if it's a valid click, I'm guessing most people are less like to follow through with a purchase thus driving down the overall bid price on the ad itself. Meaning less money paid out to the person serving the ad.
9096	No one wants to hear your logic here	The only thing is, there's really no other option. The USPS is *required* to service all addresses. If any of you reading this seriously believes that FedEx or UPS is ever going to service 100 Tumbleweed Ln, Bumfuck, ND, please PM me because I have these great stock options to sell you!

9101	Dreamweaver is pretty awesome though.	Flash was good while owned by Macromedia... But Adobe has this strange proclivity for turning everything it touches into shit.
9102	It's posts like this that put people on lists for visiting boingboing!	Piracy gave me a future
9103	Because obviously onslaught was opened as much as BFZ will be.	Look at the price of foil onslaught delta.
9104	Or clone an army of superhumans and bring the wrath of a vengeful god down on all our heads	They're precursors to more specialised cells. Basically they can make any other cells (though there are different types of stem cells which have different properties/limitations) and therefore have the potential to treat diseases involving cell damage and destruction, or could be used to grow organs for transplantation from the patient's own cells, avoiding rejection.
9105	MINE IS 500 DID I WIN I AM VERYSMART BUT I'M TOO LAZY	Damn you got me beat. Let's all post our IQs so we can see who's smarter. Mine is 203.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510
9106	But this guy isn't Kanye so how could they possibly be real?	Let's get this out of the way: yes both yeezys are real.
9107	Because you know, democrats are soooo much better.	Probably because saying the GOP are incompetent fucksticks is pretty much like saying water is wet at this stage.
9108	Yeah, we haven't been able to do that at all.	The internet needs a way to imply sarcasm in text format.. I suggest 'Sarcasm Snakes'!!! Just surround sarcastic statements in the tilde sign. Ex: ~~ This is the best Reddit post ever! ~~ SARCASM SNAKES~~
9109	Apache Chief and Samurai aren't even real fucking characters, but I guess they're closer to real than any woman.	Sorry, but no shirt should have Kalibak, Red Tornado and Dr. Sivana on without having at least Wonder Woman, Black Canary and Starfire.
9110	Kind of freaky too.	Still pretty cool to see your own doppelganger :D
9111	im moving to iowa which is ABC, it boggles my mind as Im from south Louisiana which has very little between people and their booze	Liquor laws are such a hodge-podge of garbage. I have lived in 5 states and the sheer sillyness of it all is annoying. My least favorites where the states with the ABC stores.
9112	Hurr	I was busy, so I made a quick DerpChica, I regret my life decisions.
9113	I know, i need to reset my town now (I now know not to reload backups, Thats what caused it) if i hack ever again (i will) it will be just for money and furniture, the hack i use lets you destroy the river in your town, Im also going to keep reseting my town till its the best i can get one	Yeah, that's why I don't use third party hacking like Gameshark and such, as even the companies warn that they'll corrupt games. Unless it's promoted by Nintendo (good luck...) it is never a good idea.
9114	It's much better than 1.	i bought 2 already and haven't played it x.x

9120	Why in the goddess's name did anyone downvote you?	The whole "humans only use 10% of their brain" thing really pisses me off. They use that 10% for what? Critical thinking and problem solving? Each part of the brain does something different and it's not even comparable.

9138	And here we see someone completely missing the point of the manga	Do you really call that development? And damn, Naruto is supposed to be the one with the strongest will but constantly he needs to be handheld, both literally and figuratively, from Hinata, Sasuke, the Kyuubi, etc. I don't think it was even that important, because Neji just frigging died and that alone should have motivated him.

9160	The Pirates don't understand idioms!	The words "Sun" and "son" have different meanings. "Sun" is the name for the star around which our entire solar system revolves, while "son" is the name used to refer to individuals' male child. Also, I think that when your parents say "the world doesn't revolve around you" they are saying colloquially that there are other people to consider beside yourself; they're calling you selfish or self-centered. I hope this clears that all up

9171	Sssh, no one cares about the truth or what Norwegians might think, there's xenophobic and racist hysteria to be had!	As ape raptly the only Norwegian to,reply to the thread it is worth pointing out that the convictions handed out are normal in Norway. The ethniticity of the convicted has no impact. White, blank pink or purple, the law is the same. Sorry to disappoint all you right wing lunatics, but this has no news value in Norway, it's just (and in no way do I approve of this) rape case and conviction.

She said the kids zone will have swimming lessons (always a good thing, especially after Sewol), the China zone will have Chinese sand sculpture art and animation, and the the foreign zone will have a tanning place (because god knows the Koreans don't want to get dark) and volleyball mats. It's a festival atmosphere and no one will be excluded from any other zone. It's themed, not segregated.

9186	the globe vs flat math should only change the answer by a few thousands miles at most.	I've explained it to you over and over. The angle of your two earth based observations inside the triangle are incorrect because it assumes a globe. This massively distorts your results
9187	Hurrah for red tape crushing a novel business idea.	Is this a real thing? Because Last year me and a mate looked into starting our own business doing this and we couldn't get it off the ground(excuse the pun) because of the legality of it all. After we consulted with CASA, they informed us there's a law that says you need to have personal protective equipment amongst other things when you fly indoors, depending on heaps of factors like the size of the aircraft, distance from it(something like 30 metres!), etc. When the general public gets involved it gets even more complicated with insurance and liability etc.

9215	Because all that Russian gun pen buff was needed!	Everyone's complaining about the Tiger II 105 losing a minuscule amount of penetration, and when it gains the ability to do this nobody bats an eye. For all the Russian bias supposedly in this game, the Germans/Americans get some really nice features.
9216	While this is definitely a reasonable and safe stance, it is quite anthropogenic and I think what the other poster is getting at is that if we imagine the magnitude of leaps we've made scientifically in the last century and add another two or three of those onto where we are no, it's not difficult to conceive that interstellar travel could become possible.	As I said, it is possible that physics is wrong. However, we have no reason to think so, and excellent evidence to suspect that it is correct. Therefore, our expectations should be based on physics, and not magic. The aliens might appear in your closet tonight, but probably won't. They might have a magic telescope that lets them see across space instantly, but probably not. *How can you say probably not? Are you saying you know all the technology of a civilization that was building star sized structures a thousand years ago?* No, I'm asserting what the evidence, in terms of our modern understanding of physics, leads me to believe.
9217	upvoting because peenoy pride	450 upvotes, no comments? wtf reddit? I lived for 4 months in the Philippines and people there are mostly just really happy with not much and smiling, maybe that's why.
9218	I SOOOOO want to pull the trigger on this for my 1520....but, I think I'm going to be patient, and wait until 2017 when ATT updates me	After running build Windows 10 Mobile build 10549 on my Lumia 920 for five days, I'm ready to call it: W10m is good enough to be run on your primary device. This build is by far the fastest, most stable and most polished build Microsoft has released yet. It hasn't spontaneously restarted at all. Pretty much everything works perfectly. It looks great. Every screen is beautifully laid-out with well-designed, tight animations and a cohesive visual design throughout. It responds quickly--more quickly than a three-year-old phone has any business running a brand-new OS. It isn't perfect. There are flaws. Cortana is still rather flaky. Some apps still quit unexpectedly. I have had to power-cycle my phone once. But none of the flaws are a big deal. If Microsoft decided to release this tomorrow as the public, retail release, I wouldn't even be concerned. If you've been waiting for a solid Windows 10 build to run on your daily driver, this is it.
9219	Yeah that bit where Ashoka decapitates 4 Death Watch members is very childish	4-6 then 1-3. I think order of release is best. I will show it to my children this way. The impact of events in 4-6 is greater if you don't know what's coming. In my view not only is are 1-3 not good movies, but they contain spoilers for the best plot twists in 4-6. I may even show my kids 4-6 and years later show then 1-3 when they're able to understand that explosions do not make a good film haha. Not sure about 7-9 yet obviously! Also some people may tell you to watch TCW animated series between 2-3. I do not recommend this. If you don't like the cartoony Star Wars that Jar Jar represents, I don't think you'll like actual cartoon SW. Not that Jar Jar is in a ton of episodes, but the whole feel of it seems childish to me and doesn't add to the experience of watching the live action movies. Enjoy!

9238	No dude, its beacuase he is a true patriot who is excercising his 2nd Amendment rights while having his camera loaded and ready to fire.	He's doing it to provoke the cops so he can make a stupid video and put it on YouTube. He's doing it because he's a douche.

I'm a big fan of shows like Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and Avatar. But I can't stand shows like Regular Show, Phineas and Ferb, or Uncle Grandpa. Where do you all think this one falls?

9253	You first.	Why is that edgy? Seven billion is five billion too many. Especially when a mass extinction is underway. How are we going to feed that many people if everything is dead?
9254	Yes, because collectivization is all that socialism is, and poor planning on the part of those mentioned governments makes the ideology defunct.	Liberal brings up "Muh Holodomor" and other liberal talking points to say socialism won't change anything.

As an interesting note, I saw a sign in a black owned inner city pharmacy that they would no longer provide birth control to black customers, as it is a plot to exterminate black people.

9278	I mean if it rotates one way and makes super hot updrafts, surely it works backwards right?	Or does it suck super cold air down from high up and instantly freezes anything and everything like in that one movie
9279	Yeah, that's way more important than the technological strides he's making.	Agreed. I found his presentation endearing because I like the guy and what he works on, but his stage presence leaves something to be desired.
9280	Hecz is a powerful man	Do you think Clayster will leave Denial? I feel like he has really found a home with that org and buys in them. I know it hasn't been that long, but I kinda feel like he'd stay there and be their nade
9281	This season just keeps getting better	Blue Jays hitting coach Brook Jacoby suspended 14 games
9282	But I thought they dedicate the 4th of July every year to commemorating a mistake?	Meh. How do you become a global super power when you're busy accepting your mistakes?
9283	And got kicked from C9	Does anyone have the song name at the ending? Shazam didn't go to well.
9284	But wait if they don't mention it then they don't cared about feedback and they're assholes for not listening to the community!	So in your opinion what they need to do is to take all the hundreds of comments that are nothing but mindless bitching and don't ever mention it, when you cant take a simple lighthearted joke.
9285	Mate we have Nick Blackman, no winger in the country could force him out of our side!	From watching him for past 3/4 years I would say he is middle to low Championship side. He would be good at let's say a Reading or a Bolton in my opinion, no offence to those clubs
9286	Got all my grades now.	Anyone actually get all their grades? Still missing two grades and the deadline to drop a course for the summer semester is tomorrow, gotta love the new Student Center.
9287	Guys, it's just a few bad apples.	Houston FBI Justified Spying on Protestors by Saying Keystone Pipeline was Vital to National Security
9288	that's exactly why we need to dismantle capitalism	Not only that but bigger stores like CVS and 711 aren't going to open up shop in these neighborhoods if they get burned down enough. If the cost of doing business outweighs potential profit, why would anyone open up a shop there?
9289	As long as you recognize that you're bad, that's enough.	Lol that's my favorite part of this. When people call me a SJW I can't tell if I'm supposed to be a woman with blue hair and some kind of very extreme anxiety disorder where I can't go outside without being offended by everything, or someone who fakes PTSD, or part of some shadowy new world order organization.
9290	That would be hilarious:)	Thanks, now I'm imagining Yoda on a dating site sending women pictures of his green wang.

9310	Yeah let's get rid of the 5 second inbound rule too	Honestly does anybody REALLY care? I think its kind of a dumb rule anyways.
9311	Well, I mean, if he knows how to do a triple bypass then he wouldn't need the degree...	Do you really need a degree to be a doctor? Would you want someone doing a triple bypass on your heart who just walked in off the street and watched a few videos? The job of pastor is far more serious and there are some very stern warnings for those who would take on that title and the proceed to preach falsely.

9315	That's a better idea than just calling the nasty fucker out.	I might just report it stolen
9316	Explore the tetrapack option	I'm in a beverage company and we want to scale. But our juice is only good for 3-4 days. So my friend started a juice company a little over a year ago, and was mainly working on word of mouth and sending sample to his friend. I got involved six months ago. I was focusing on the product and business side of things. Now we go to local shows and we're at farmer's markets. We have a lot of positive feedback and have been selling out of our juice every weekend. Right now, I am working through a business plan/go to market strategy to increase our sales. But our juices expiration is the biggest flaw, our juices is 100% fruit and it will go bad in four days. We don't want to pasteurize because we want to be different from Naked Juice. Has anyone else tried a business like this? What did you do to increase the lifetime of your juices? Our goal is 2-4 weeks. As for scaling we thought of a variety of things. We want to get into fresh/organic type stores. We are trying to get a table one day to sell juices at our city's Whole's Foods and Trader Joe's. We are also targeting small organic shops as well. We are thinking about an ecommerce platform but we aren't sure yet. Getting into stores would be the best. So, there's a few things we need to work on first. We make the juices ourselves in his house. In the beginning stages we were going to do 4 bottles in each small store we were targeting for free. We just want them to carry it and if their customers like it they could order more from us. We know that's not sustainable in the long run, should we start looking for distributors? -- I think my main questions are: * Has one had experience increasing the shelf life of their products? * Is ecommerce for this business viable or should we stick to retail stores? * When's a good time to look for distributers?
9317	It was really boring cold calling local businesses to sell shoddy advertising, so I just surfed the internet for two weeks until she noticed I hadn't generated any leads and she fired me.	Reddit, amuse us with the stories of how you lost your job?
9318	Don't forget h*gs; we don't want to ruin our childrens innocence.	woah man we say k*sses around here
9319	Probably where he's going is just way more important than where you're going.	You don't know me or my car. Different cars have different amounts of "pick up". Different people have different reaction times. I *know* I'm slow on the draw, and my car is ancient. Which means that I need a wider gap than others. I'm not being indecisive, I just know that I won't make that gap. People might look at that situation and say "I could have made that turn" and they'd be right, but **I** wouldn't have. I need to make the turn that I know I'll make, even if I moderately inconvenience a person or two. Rushing me into making the bad turn is only going to get people hurt/killed and cause a worse traffic jam.
9320	No, blow me.	Blow me.
9321	If only it were like the good old days right?	Their parents also likely didn't give a shit about them. Dissolution/destruction of the nuclear family, lack of educational opportunities and lack of interest in the ones that exist, poor environmental surroundings, etc.

9324	HD Tingle hype	I've always liked the idea of cartography in games, mainly in the sense that someone needed to explore and map out an area for the map to exist. Think about Meriwether's handwritten map from the Lewis and Clark expedition compared to a more detailed map a century later, and then compared to google maps today. Maps improve with time and further exploration. I prefer it when your starting map is outdated or small but you need to travel to an area and find a local explorer that has marched off into the unknown and learned of the terrain in the nearby wilderness. Shoot, while typing this out I just realized that I pretty much just described Tingle...shit.

9328	It's a HUGE GOD DAMN ISSUE with Jehovah's witnesses	Detailed report based on the police reports from 2006 InTouch dug up with a FoIA request. Seems when it was discovered he was abusing minors (some of whom were his sisters) the family opted to keep things compartmentalized within the church. In my opinion this practice is probably widespread amongst Christians and serves to institutionalize abuse. The same thing the Catholic Church has been doing for decades. This is a family that is an icon amongst the conservative Christian world and campaigns against gay rights. Josh has since resigned his post at the Family Research Council, a Christian anti-gay lobbying group, in the wake of this report. I personally this report undermines the families credibility and moral character. These people argue that gay and transgender folk are child molesters who shouldn't be around kids. I know who I wouldn't want my kid around, and it's not the pleasant gay man who makes me lattes at my local Starbucks once a week.

9331	I have thus far avoided it, and I intend to keep it that way	Keep saying "no." That's particularly important because it will help put some boundaries on your *very* boundary-invading mother. The trick of telling someone else something on your behalf, then telling you that now that she's run her mouth, you *have* to back her up, is manipulative and sly. It's critical that you *never* hold a baby, and that you call out her lying. "No. Oh my mother told you I wanted to? She made that up. She does that a lot. You can't believe anything she says, right Mama?"
9332	Yea, fuck him!	Thank you. I been telling people since this Akon bullshit started, all he's fucking doing is starting a conversation. He hasn't ACHIEVED jack shit as of yet. He's just fucking talking about it. He wants to educate them in order to build and maintain the infrastructure needed to supply 600million with electricity.

9337	Aldnoah Zero second season.	Name an anime you've dropped, stalled, or are about to drop, and let others tell you why you should keep watching. Also list what episode you're on or what you specifically like or dislike about it so far. For me, I dropped Guilty Crown after episode 21, because I disliked how he became anime Hitler.

9349	What brand flavors?	First DIY recommendation? Hey guys been a lurker here for a while now and was finally sick of buying juices so I dropped the dough on a starter DIY kit. I can do the research to figure out how to mix, but I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations on what flavors to start mixing with. I was thinking like some kind of orange creamsicle or fruity menthol blend but what do you guys think. Thanks. WHAT I HAVE Plain 125ml VG Base 125ml of 25mg/ml nic PG base Flavor 1: Peppermint Flavor 2: Cool Flavor 3: French Vanilla Flavor 4: Orange Select Flavor 5: Cream Flavor 6: Lemon Flavor 7: Real Honey Flavor 8: Subtle Cinnamon Flavor 9: Ripe Strawberry Flavor 10: Raspberry

9351	I know right?	Fucking Flacco, what has he ever done to deserve the starting job anyway?
9352	Yeah penises are hella unattractive	Penises. I know a lot of girls think they're weird looking or something but I like them. I think they're super cute/adorable when they're soft and squishy and a big turn-on when they're not. Please don't send me dick pics.
9353	But AW will inherently have more skilled players cause they don't hate their player base	Nope, came back after a break somewhat recently. If you think the Matchmaking in Armored Warfare is going to be significantly better or the business model hugely different I think you're in for a bit of a rude awakening... :| In fact about the only thing I can guarantee you is that you probably won't have to put up with Storm's Slovic sense of humor, assuming the AW devs even do any sort of live Q&amp;A regularly.

Yeah, but that's not saying much considering how historically bad we were doing before he took over. The fact is though, we are still looking at "real" unemployment of around 10%. Nothing to pat Obama on the back for.

I have a decent job, and I'm single and have no kids, and am very effective with managing my credit and money. I get a huge discount through work on a lot of monthly expenses that I take full advantage of. I also share the house I'm in with 3 other people, all in the same situation so we have a big place while paying considerably less than your average apartment.

9418	Right, because a review on the available content on the first day will be reflective of our experience forever.	I hope they don't so it'll show in the review. They should review the same exact experience we will experience.
9419	Wow philly fans dislike their rival what scumbags	pretty much describes phillies fans in general
9420	I think it would be harder, because we would vomit every 5 seconds.	It is only easier because it is more readily available. If we had a drink that had a 1000 calories of fat it wouldn't be any harder to drink if it was 1000 calories of sugar.

9422	So not only was WoW the first MMO, it also had the first Garrison system ever?	Order Hall.... Garrison? After the groan worthy nature of running multiple garrisons in WoW, I look at this order hall thing and frankly, I've only been picking up the Garrison Cache- I mean Order Gifts. I really, really am not feeling like doing this especially since I don't see any notable rewards from any of it. Am I missing something? I am extremely off-put from the idea from the get-go.

9429	Bicycles can have steering wheels	But they're in a car
9430	It's a little frustrating and exciting to know that the writers are getting rich while someone on a forum on Reddit has infinitely better ideas.	I kind of agree with you on Rumple. I feel like the end of the Neverland arc was the perfect ending for his character, and they ruined it by bringing him back. If this were a novel without things like actors and contracts, I think the Oz arc should have involved Zelena tricking Neal into becoming the new Dark One by pushing him on a mad quest to be reunited with Henry, rather than reviving Rumple. It would have allowed the story to move into new ground, while also providing a great parallel to what happened with his father.
9431	Cause he is totally a real socialist and not just another liberal	Maybe these banks are too powerful, I may have to vote for Bernie Sanders.
9432	burncream.jpg	I think you verified someones flair once in the last year. Can't think of much else. :)
9433	Just exploding bread tovarish)))))))	Video reportedly shows one of Russians 'humanitarian aid' convoy exploding in Stavropol, Russia today
9434	"And that's when I noticed he was a 20 foot tall monster from the Paeleolithic Era."	Met on a tinder, exchanged around 10 texts before this
9435	But only dirty whoooores wear red lipstick.	"I don't like your lipstick." I used to work at a gas station and, like with most retail jobs, I had my fair share of rude customers. I was behind the register talking to a friend who'd popped in to say hi when a customer approached the front counter. Okay cool, just needed to be rung up. Standard stuff. The customer was a lady who looked to be in her late 30's - she had no makeup on that I'd noticed, was modestly dressed, and her hair was drawn tight into a ponytail at the nape of her neck. Pretty typical looking woman for the small conservative town I worked in. I guess this is where I should mention that I was wearing red lipstick that night, as I did during many of my shifts. (I looooove me some red lipstick.) I made some friendly small talk, but throughout the entire transaction, this lady was silent. And she was staring at my mouth. I got weird vibes that she was angry about something, but I didn't ask why; I went to hand her the grocery bag and told her to have a good night. "I don't like your lipstick." Her response snapped out of her mouth like she'd been trying to hold it in but just couldn't do it anymore. "What?" "Your lipstick - it's too dark. I don't like it." I kind of froze, not sure how to respond to her unsolicited critique of my makeup. Did she really think that her opinion about my lipstick was so important that she *had* to share it? When I don't know what to say, I just smile. So I did that. She tried to backtrack, saying that red just didn't look good on me, but I just kept smiling. The more she spoke, the wider my smile got. My friend, who had been watching the entire time, tried to stifle his laughter and failed miserably. I think that was the moment when she realized how completely inappropriate she was being and hightailed it out of there. I still get annoyed when I think of that interaction. I wear lipstick for *myself*, not to cater to *your* specific tastes, lady. People can be so self-absorbed, I swear.
9436	I'm not going to believe this until I see what Alex Jones has to say about this.	Wal-Mart reveals overhaul plan for its closed store on Admiral and Memorial
9437	It's the mercury that gets you fat not extra calories	Fattie is the one going on about the fruit-to-meat ratio and mercury bullshit? A little more context might help this post. If so, yeah that makes sense - make up weird diet science and other fucktardery to justify not simply eating less calories.
9438	Yes, the fact that she did drugs was what caused everyone to ignore her while she was giving birth.	Bitch shouldnt have done drugs while she was pregnant.
9439	There is nothing silly in this question since there is no clear indication of the game name in the animation or title of the post.	Probably a silly question but what game is this?
9440	I want to believe.	Here's a little secret. There is an IRC channel of about ~20 people who get together to write fakes stories for Twoxchromosomes just to see what they'll believe. These stories often reach the frontpage.
9441	It definitely should negate it completely.	Hard wired counters 6th sense not cold blooded and it doesnt negate it completely

9446	Just like my... bike?	Hint: It rams into your butt over and over until you arrive.
9447	yeah, I meant to say that it shouldn't replace all pick.	Aren't all game modes optional?
9448	Would you be my datemate?	I'm a trans boy but don't call me he.
9449	But.. But.. The dogwhisperer said they are a peaceful species.	I love how so many people rest firmly in the "It's all in how you raise them" camp. I'm not saying this man didn't raise these dogs to be vicious, but pit bulls have aggression bred into them. Just one generation of responsible pet ownership won't completely nullify the fact that this dog breed is far more likely to attack people or other dogs than say a labrador or an english bulldog. That being said I will never leave my children with any type of dog. It only takes one time for a dog to permanently disfigure or kill. I have a 4 year old and these kind of stories make me ill. I don't know why I keep coming on r/news.
9450	I like this theory.	I think no one ever taught her how to ride a bike and she tried all those different ways trying to figure it out.
9451	That's all in line with a capitalist economy, one in which the capital is owned privately.	You can disagree on how I described it but it's definitely not capitalist. The government plays a huge part in the economy and corporate monopolies prevent free market competition in a lot of areas.
9452	Annual salary / 12 months	Can someone help me with the math I need to do to know how much I'll get paid month to month? I was offered a job in NYC but where I come from we get told the amount on a monthly basis (not yearly) and I'm not sure of what I should do to get the monthly amount. Sorry if this isn't the place to ask, seemed the most appropriate. If that's not the case, just let me know please.
9453	The point of this sub is that they are supposed to *not* be named	Well we need a name, damnit!
9454	yeah state owned media companies in states notorious for using state owned media companies as propaganda outlets are definitely not propaganda when they quote the officials who control those media companies.	yeah quoting officials and providing information is propaganda nowdays. lol.
9455	But if you're going to play blind pick why not play Team Builder?	Or if you got first world problems like me, where your computer loads so quickly that you load in before everyone else. You then either call too fast and someone who wants the role loads in after and doesn't see it then argues with you. Or you wait until every one is loaded, but you wait too long accidentally and someone else calls it right before you hit enter.
9456	This conundrum could be solved if people had a "No Candidate" section in the polls, so you could still vote even if you didn't like any of the potential candidates.	Or, let's not. People have the right to not vote.
9457	Lol, im still not racist :D And your conclusions are weird as fuck...	Of course you're proud of your racism. Your complex and, tbh, quite repulsive theories on race aside...You know why Sweden is closing the borders? There is no more housing because nobody, including the danes, are doing anything to help. There is no bigger picture beyond that. As for the topic of discussion: Your reasoning is that denmark needs money, therefore it must rob refugees? Really?
9458	*countries economies do not work like homes	Bankruptcy is a principle I guess.
9459	Its a Hybrid Spelldamage mod he can craft 40% spell damage on top of it with Cata.	The local crit is too low to matter, the life on hit is irrelevant, the spell dmg./mana and the added fire mod is lower than it could be. The base and spell crit is nice. Not worth much in currentcy, but could be used.

9461	Now maybe the BLM folks will get off their butts and organize for Sanders instead of throwing tantrums and attacking him at town halls.	Bernie just posted the full uncut Sandra Bland arrest video on his campaign page. This is a BOLD statement. #blacklivesmatter
9462	So he was pretty much another incarnation case?	there were a lot of "this guy is an asshole and every team who let's him play is unethical" comments after forgiven got banned last split
9463	Lebatard	Le who?
9464	It could also haunt the Cardinals if they all die on the next play!	That's a back breaker. That fumble could end up haunting Vikings.

9470	But at least it's still faster than the Mclaren, amirite?	That joke is kinda getting old
9471	Because he's a selfless hero obviously.	I don't get your point though. Why would the image of our planet with a healthy nature make you, or anybody, happy? No offense, it just doesn't make sense to me - as a human, humanless Earth seems rather pointless. Also, the folks that would rather see humanity go extinct so that no more plants and animals 'must die'. That's not the attitude we evolved and survived as far with. Why?
9472	OR GREGS	Like buildings.
9473	whoa taking reddit this seriously huh?	Maybe I should include a joke tag. Or maybe you should learn context of jokes. Either or really. But I shouldn't have to tag posts for those too stupid to get what is clearly a joke.

9476	The book tracks account wide, not character.	Can multiple characters punch in wins for the SRL book? I'm pretty sure I've got enough wins spread across my warlock and hunter but not individually. Anyone know if I can take like 7 wins off hunter and 3 wins off warlock to make 10 for one page?

9480	pictures?	I have a hard time telling when people are kidding. At my second conference, our club's president told us dressing up for crisis committee was "highly encouraged." My committee was a JCC on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. I was a member of the Mujahideen. I showed up in a full makeshift turban and beard, only to find out I was the only kid that showed up in costume.

9494	If there was a unique with these stats, people would be using it lol	well obviously some uniques are too good to pass up and they don't have life, but I've never found it too hard to find good items with good life roll or at the least mastercrafted life roll. Besides for leveling in a race/new league I've never had a mapping char that doesn't have life on every rare item that can roll it
9495	I like it, therefore discussing any possible flaw is a personal attack on me.	I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not, haha.
9496	I had no idea so many people cared so much about their homeless veterans.	I must say among people I know this did have the most angry memes shared on facebook.
9497	I think the state of vision and true sight is just purrfect.	There is currently no way to reliably deal with Invisibility. They removed the oracle effect on the red trinket upgrade, they removed the pink totem, and if you wanna go further they also removed oracles way back. After you start building up your 3rd item you have virtually no space to buy pinks, and with big items being split into a more extensive recipe, having space is a rare thing.

9511	but it's wirelessssss......(said in whiny tone)	I forgot the first rule of troubleshooting Long time lurker, first time poster. You know the drill I recently started working as tier 1 lab consulting for my university. Earlier today, there was an alert stating that a printer in the lab I was working in needed to be rebooted because of a bad pdf. I went up to the aforementioned printer and tried to turn it on, but it wouldn't boot. I filled out an out-of-order card and even printed up signs to tell users they could not print to this printer. Fast forward to about 10 mins ago, when a supervisor told me to check the printer. So, even though I was sure it wouldn't boot, I dutifully went and checked on it. Turns out the power cable had been disconnected from the back. The first step when something won't turn on is always "is it plugged in?", yet I went 3 hours without figuring that out. Seems I still have a lot to learn here. tl;dr printer won't turn on because it had no power. Who would have guessed electronics need electricity?
9512	Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew Pocket Edition	Cube SMP PE I am a huge fan of the cube, and I am also a minecraft pocket edition player. I thought it would be cool to see how many of you guys play PE so maybe we could start a server to dedicate to the cube! Drop a comment if you also play PE

9520	Hypocrisy runs wild all over Reddit, but it's also true that some subs are circle-jerkier than others.	sure, but it's also the dominant voice on reddit calling them out, which is a bit silly. i don't see general reddit circlejerking or navel-gazing called out here but of course it exists. it's hypocritical

9524	If the grandparents didn't want to be genocided, they shouldn't have been born genetically inferior	Which is ironic because neither of those groups is responsible for it. Imagine if people going on rants about the murder of minorities actually blamed their grandparents.
9525	B-but the title of the episode.	The joke doesn't even work, since that episode was about *ice* on Mars, and we've known that was there for a while.
9526	I wish everyone were that responsible.	They interviewed a CC permit holder from the Oregon shooting who basically said he didn't use his gun because he didn't want to be shooting a gun when the people who were trained to deal with the situation showed up to deal with the situation.
9527	It is not that uncommon to have the most talented and promising player of the second team in your squad on the last match day with a practically meaningless game, is it?	Does he actually deserve to be in the squad after Real Madrid castilla's season or is it just been given to him on merit or a clause in his contract?

9539	Yeah you are so good you rekt those mgs.. obligatory	so, I decided to play against MG ranks, for fun
9540	This is a reasonable opinion.	Anyone who supports Clinton is a pedestrian, low information drone who ignores most current events and lacks any sort of context for geopolitical history. Beyond the drumbeat of "she is the only option" seen in the media, she is quintessentially the worst and most abominable exemplar of the systemic failure of the American federal governance. To vote her for president is almost directly equitable to saying "I don't care about myself, my family, or the well being of anyone in any country." To vote her for president is to vote for the oligarchs in all their tyrannical blood lust. To vote her is to say "I don't really give a shit how many people die because of us military and secret shadow government action."
9541	Credit card companies and banks share customer credit scores with each other	I was almost in that boat. A drunken facebook application to Capital One accepted me. After 30 days they quadrupled my credit line and my score rose about 70 points. My score and debt were the same, and I applied to Capital One every six months or so. I wonder if they have some sort of deal with Facebook?

That place is a fucking cesspool, and it's the fault of the men.

I've looked at custom ASP baton caps, t-shirts, plaques, etc. What are some of the better and more useful gift ideas that these recruits might be able to use once they graduate (provided that any custom gear has prior approval)?

9560	You must be fun to live with.	He may not consider those chores "basic", but rather, "pointless." Spotless, unstained cleanliness of a receptacle of piss and shit from buttholes doesn't make a tremendous amount of sense. Elaborate sorting and folding of wrinkle-free fabrics doesn't make much sense, either - finding any *particular* pair of undies or socks isn't something you need to do provided all your socks match each other (and why would you be so dumb as to buy non-matching socks?), though separate *piles* for different people's clothing does make some sense. Separating colors and whites in the laundry is pointless because you should be washing on cold/cold *anyway*, to prolong the life of your fabrics and avoid shrinking and puckering hems. If you put tees on hangers, you're slowly stretching out the necks. Repeated folds in *any* fabrics weaken the fibers. Nobody should be putting pre-rinsed dishes into any dishwasher. The detergents you're using *need* food waste to attack, or they'll attack the surface of your dishes instead. Imagine *his* frustration - "I keep showing my partner that the house isn't going to burn down if the socks go in a pile and there's one speck of dook in the toilet bowl, but she *just isn't getting it!* And she keeps acting like our dishwasher and clothes washer are from 1950! What is *with* this woman?"

My brother had just been through the same thing over an 8 week period before he got *anything*. I'm on a sole income and have been supporting him. I've had to take out an extension to my personal loan just to get us somewhere to live together as we couldn't stay where we were. Short of bawling our eyes out at the centrelink office we basically had to take almost every offer of help from friends and even couch surfing into four different homes before we could find somewhere we could afford to live. It is shit and I know the feels dude. Some poor souls are out there basically homeless with nowhere to turn because of such a lazy, unorganized, uninformed and unsympathetic inhumane system. If I could add more adjectives about how I feel about the situation I would.

9585	yes because that's the message i was trying to convey.	By 'uses app correctly' parlance, an application would be a sub-program that composes a program. A program is like a painting made of apps. An application is a specific, single use of a program. A program is a suite of applications. But fuck it apple is cool and steve jobs omg &lt;3 genius and i-phones revolutonary and all that so lets just call everything apps.

So the phone and Internet is going to be the best in your life and you will annoy the ever loving shit out of people with your complaints at your next duty station.

Maybe there's a question you've been asked that was unusual and interesting and led to good conversation. Are there any questions that YOU'VE asked your date that you think they appreciated?
9618	Get back to work, Derek.	Once spent half an school internship writing chapters of a story project I did instead of the manuals and reports I was supposed to do. I shared the office with my boss. Still have that report card with an empasize on "hardworking" somewhere.

9620	TIL not everyone has under cabinet vacuum system.	My millionaire uncle has a 500 dollar toaster his wife convinced him to buy, he hates it. Their entire kitchen is is extravagant, they have drawers that refrigerate and drawers that keep food warm... for parties. The crown jewel they have is a vacuum system built into the moulding under the cabinets so they can sweep into them without having to bend over and use a dustpan.

I love that Canadian Baseball is a thing. Just letting you know that while I am pissed about all the trades my team made, you guys did pick up a Bandwagon fan. Show the Royals how to have some class, would ya?
9629	Yeah, it's not like the characters, or the performances, or the visuals, or the music, or the sound design, or the editing, or any of that could make up for it... TFA sucks lol	We get it, it's like ANH. Guess we all don't have to go watch it now and try to enjoy Star Wars.
9630	Sky orb	Which higher ranking arena spheres would you like to see in the Achievement Store? So far we have gotten more powerful spheres (debatable) up to maybe Eris (3,840,000 Arena Points) from the achievement shop. Which Arena spheres (or from somewhere else) would you like to buy in the near future? For me I would love a Fury Core (75% BB Gauge Fill Rate)
9631	I just started playing again recently, I've noticed that there isn't much incentive to talk to other people at lower levels, but by the time you hit dungeons pvp and wvw people are normally pretty willing to help, especially with dungeons (something about not wanting to fail the mission brings out people's inner teacher in this game instead of their inner Stalin).	Veteran WoW player here, what's the community like here? As someone who's been playing WoW for about a decade by now, I finally realized I just hate playing because there's 0 community. I don't know anyone, I log in, no one cares, I log out, no one cares. Years ago I used to have tons of good friends...yadda yadda yadda. You've all heard this sob story. I just want to know how the GW2 community is, I just bought this game back in January, and haven't touched it until 6.2 in WoW, and so I'm looking to find somewhere else to spend my time :)
9632	It has more movespeed than shiv Boom headshot	Either way, rapid in either case is still far from descriptive of the item's passive.

9640	You at least need to by some beat synching software!	Agreed, please excuse my saltiness. Too many people I know subscribe to the "anyone with iTunes can be a DJ" philosophy.
9641	The main problem is that it eventually needs to be moved, sure not for a while, but I guess I just like a "Fire and forget" solution.	well, what I usually do is this: - create a BC pump, 2 levers, 4 BC redstone engines, a chunkloader and 2 endertanks. - take a stack or two of cobble and go into the nehter (yes you hate it, I know), build a little hut of 4*3 so you have room for a gate and 3*3 for the pump. - set the pump up, tank on top of it, redstone engines against the pump - lava fo' months! It kinda sucks the nether empty, but I've been able to run my base on it for months on a server, and that was with another pump almost right next to it as well. Or if you reeeeally don't ever wanna enter the nether, repeat the above steps in a Mystcraft/RF Tools lava dimension.
9642	Well that would explain why I had no idea.	It's Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead.
9643	Somebody managed to fuck up his joke some posts above by shopping in the apple on the wrong side.	Yea but you could probably take anything and say that and it could be true... just like clouds.
9644	You mean like Ben did this year?	Who didn't see this coming? A 2 time Super Bowl winning QB wants to set the mark for highest paid quarterback when his contract is up is the most predictable story that was coming out of New York. Has the Manning family ever been known to take lesser contracts to really help out the team similar to something like a Brady contract? I'm not being facetious, I'm curious to what that answer is.
9645	Realistically they'll probably just do another IC title ladder match and he'll probably be in it	Is Dean Ambrose the No. 3 in the company right now behind Reigns and Lesnar? Why I think they are building him for Triple H or Lesnar at Mania He's been beating Kevin Owens with regularity (tag match on RAW, SS, TLC). He recently beat Ziggler and Breeze with ease. He made it to the SS tournament finals. Beat the former World champ Sheamus on a RAW main event after eating his finisher before the match started. Who is hotter right now than Ambrose? Reigns pinned him at SS but it's Reigns. The Wyatt Family has been weak against real competition. Cena lost clean to Alberto Del Rio and Kevin Owens this year Ambrose hasn't eaten any clean pins to midcarders that I recall. With Seth Rollins gone it feels like Ambrose is Number three on the current roster and will either replace Seth in the Rollins vs Triple H match or fight Lesnar. How they build to it I don't know yet but it seems likely. If WWE wants Reigns vs Lesnar then it will be Ambrose vs Trips. If they go with Reigns vs Trips then Ambrose gets Lesnar and probably loses a hard fought match that earns him respect.
9646	The two things you literally just mentioned, banning handguns and an increase in murders.	What two things? We're talking about sex, murder, condoms, and guns.
9647	RIP Hype	We will have to delay launch until Sunday Hello, In CivEx 1.0, we have experienced quite some problems with the economy and wealth because of bad ore generation. This time around, we would like to actually get it right, and not have an abundance or lack of ores. We have been working on a very tight schedule, and after I exported the latest version of the map of the server, we realized the ore generation was not right at all and would be disastrous in the long term of CivEx 2.0. Because of this, I sadly have to readjust the ore generation one last time through worldpainter and export and upload the map again. This will take up at least 24 hours, and because of that we have to push the release to sometime on Sunday. Besides this problem, everything in CivEx 2.0 is finished, so right now we are only waiting for the map to finish exporting and uploading. We are terribly sorry for this incident, and can understand your dissapointment.

9654	But dude we lack teh leadership skillz and have no souls, everybody knows that!	Asian parents don't fuck around when it comes to education. I'm Korean and every single summer of my childhood, I had to go to summer schools. Every day after school, I went to academies where we'd work on our homeworks then do hours of prep for standardized tests. Saturday academies for the PSAT's and SATs. Tutors. Music lessons. When I was younger I hated it and most of my time was taken up by studying or being at an academy. At my parent's expense, when they worked 6 day weeks tirelessly and never had enough money for vacations or anything luxurious. And they're crying, "It's not fair"? Cry me a fucking river. Asian kids and parents *work their fucking asses off* because they know the route to a certain kind of success is education.
9655	It's because they think they are on a racetrack and reeeeally want to clip that apex	Why the heck whenever someone needs to make a turn they swing wide towards the opposite direction of where they are turning these days? It's a simple turn people, you aren't driving a big rig! (Or if you are, doing a wide turn is perfectly understandable)

9660	The esteemed Arnold Palmer!	Sometimes the dumbest people are your coworkers When I first started serving, one of the other newbs asked another server a question that I'm not sure I would have been able to answer with a straight face: "Hey, how do I make a half lemonade half iced tea?" He's lucky his trainer was the patient type, if it were me my answer would have been something like "Well, you start with root beer, about a quarter of the cup, fill up to this line with sprite, add a dash of orange soda, THEN put in the ice, and finally some half and half. Garnish with a lemon wedge." He probably would have done it.

9731	it's great to casue it invalidates all of those stealth based trickster powers	Yeah, getting rid of the invisibility works, but nothing else. There was a forum where the designer confirmed that while active, you are literally unable to be noticed, by any means at all.

9738	Yes.	Going to the doctor for swollen ankles- do I mention keto? I think I have a pinched nerve in my back. I'm feeling something like a pulled muscle in my hamstring and my ankles have been swelling even though I'm not wearing high heals. I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow. I don't know if I'll be asked about my diet but after hearing r/keto's stories about ignorant doctors, I don't really want to have that discussion with mine.

9760	I'm guessing it's because you're still struggling with the choice of whether to be straight or gay.	Still trying to figure out if I'm getting half-sued. The rabid anti-gay people seem to ignore bisexuals... like everyone else :(
9761	Yup, just another privilege us men have here in America	Yup, so I was... I have now educated myself. I actually wasn't aware that the US circumsized boys outside of religious reasons, which actually surprises me. Sorry about that.
9762	You dropped this:	Think of how many TD catches Brandon would have had with his sure hand and those under-inflated footballs. Could have cheated his way to a 30 TD catch season.

9764	This can't possibly be true because racism doesn't exist, especially systematic racism in our judicial system from the top down!	A handful of Miami Beach police officers sent hundreds of racially offensive and pornographic emails, including about President Barack Obama, and possibly jeopardized dozens of criminal cases in which they are witnesses, the department's chief said.
9765	but 1 click memes are, like, a human right typical fundie scum right here	It is one of those scenarios where, if it were edited, I would probably approve it. By itself it's just a way to belittle Christianity, which is against the rules. If the quote was made, and explained how it connected to the image, well, that would be different.

9769	I use a tackle box.	Supply boxes I'm curious what people keep their building supplies in when you don't have the space to keep your supplies out on a desk. For example, what kind of box, container or tote you keep everything in. I mainly ask because I need something with deeper spaces to keep spools of wire and everything in.

9772	It may be scummy, but if you check the stats of teammates and enemies before the game, and think your teammates will screw you over with that knowledge then just leave and find a new lobby.	Reset Stats, Now Constantly Given Poor Teamates So I had a 1.8 K/D before I reset, but with so many games played it was just stuck even though I knew I could improve it. So I reset for the hell of it, and it's now around a 3 - and it really, really sucks. Before I'd get some bad players, sure. You're always going to have to deal with that. But now, I assume it's due to the game trying to balance the teams, I'm constantly given teammates that go 3-15, 2-12, etc every single game. Stick around to see if they're switched to the other next game? Exact same teams again. Unless I have friends online who know what they're doing, I'm essentially doomed to lose. I can't make up for the bottom 5 players of the lobby every game. I don't mean to sound like some stat-whore, but I think you could understand why losing most times even when you're on top of your game can make you just want to stop playing. Team making should be random, or by making teams like 1st 3rd 5th best stats vs 2nd 4th 6th etc. Not 1st and the bottom 5 if the 1st has a high kd. FFA counts as a loss when I come in 2nd or 3rd too so it's just as annoying. Who feels me?

When you post in a publicly accessible forum, go figure - people have the ability and the right to comment on what you post, as well as to discuss it in other fora.

9849	Yes this is exactly the same situation.	A few years ago, millions of Romanians were leaving the country for better lives in the West and putting up with a lot of prejudice along the way as well. Would have thought that we can at least understand that others, who are coming from even worse conditions, might want better lives too..but no, we were just misunderstood while they are evil Muslims.
9850	This isn't the way it is, and thankfully this point of view is dying out with old age.	Maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to ADHD, but I always viewed it as a type of personality rather then a disability. A personality that grows from poor parenting. Certainly not something I would compare to autism.

9857	I actually tried this, but it didn't make any difference :(	A method that *occasionally* works is putting the drive without cables into a sealable bag, removing as much air as possible (to prevent any condensate) and then putting that into the freezer for around an hour or two - three hours max. That should restore your drive to working order but only for a short time giving you hopefully enough time to remove your files (assuming it shows any). Sounds insane but a quick search on YouTube etc seems to show a ~30% success rate. Couple of things to note are: this should only be done if you accept that drive contents are already lost, its a pretty all or nothing procedure - a pretty high chance you could lose your data forever. Secondly, if you have ever opened up your drive (you should never do that) this will definitely break it, and don't open it up while its still cold as moisture in the air will condensate on the disc array and any data left will be erased.
9858	Blame Christianity.	Wait they're charging a minor as an adult because they're technically close enough in age to be adults. Which means those photos are technically legal? If you're going to treat someone like an adult, treat the nature of the crime that way too. Not to mention the crime is having nude selfies. What an absurd case. I'm more curious how the selfies were brought to light and why someone felt compelled to push this issue so far. Seems strange that they also searched the young girl's phone as well.
9859	I guess there are no municipal, provincial, national, or global issues that deserve our attention more than this.	This is really amazing. As I said before, this wouldn't be an issue if someone hasn't seen this as an opportunity to install fear and division. For example, if you'd ask someone does it matter if a person puts a hand on his/her heart during the national anthem, most people would be probably amused by the question and would most likely say they don't care. But put a Conservative operative on the job, give him funding and access to resources and within 6 months of a campaign that includes punditry on radio, TV and social media, veiled innuendos by various back benchers and PM himself and also, an involvement of courts and threat of pushing it to Supreme Court of Canada and ... ask a question if Canadians should hold their hand on their hearts during national anthem and you'd have 75% saying "strongly agree". This is bullshit of enormous proportions.
9860	You forgot your	No people in this game aren't that salty. Everyone is a good sport who doesn't jump to conclusions.
9861	Wow, Tunisia sure sounds like a shithole of a place	Tunisia is a tiny country squeezed between two giant ones. Tunisia has remarkably very good records for women rights, secularism and democracy compared to all other Arab Muslim countries. Tunisia, almost has no oil or gas, has GDP per capita almost equal to Algeria's, who's got giant reserves of oil and gas. Half of Tunisian women don't wear the hijab. Tunisia is the only Arab Muslim country where multiple wives is banned. Tunisia is the only Arab spring country not to fall into civil war, Islamist control of government, etc. Algeria and Libya aren't even near to Tunisia. Looking at Tunisian pages on FB, I find that Tunisians view Libyans as rapists.

9871	Yes, the subjugation of women and reactions to members of the LGTBQ community are completely comparable in number	There are regular people who follow Islam just like your regular Christian follows Christianity. In every group of people, there are extremists. I wouldn't blame the violent acts on Islam but on the violent conditions that a lot of Islamic nations are currently in.

9876	well how would he know you weren't lying to him	I once got into a fantastic argument with somebody about the concept of taqiyya. This guy insisted that taqiyya meant Muslims could lie to nonbelievers about anything at all and it's okay, but they can't lie to other Muslims. I tried to explain to him the truth of the matter but he insisted this clusterfucky article he read online was more knowledgeable than a practicing Muslim. We're actually friends on FB and I saw him share something like this just the other day, and it brought back the memory of the argument.
9877	He probably got aroused after winning penalties xD	I am not sure what answer you are looking for other than a description of what happens. The GIF is of the last penalty in a shootout. My GK is standing in the middle because that's where I think he will go. My opponent hits the bar and I win the shootout. Once the shootout ends though, my GK grows a few inches in height and width. This GIF implies that whilst penalties were taken the game made him smaller, but now it's over he has returned to full size.
9878	Well it obviously helped look how good ya turned out.	I got arrested for possession right after I had graduated. I had less than a gram and the police told me the same thing. They said because of this I would never be able to go to University ever again, I would not be able to get a job again because no one hired criminals, and I would never be able to get assistance from the government (food stamps for example). They said as a result I would likely just end up in and out of prison for the rest of my life. Obviously none of that happened. Its so insane that they think saying crap like that would somehow help me.
9879	Ah thanks, guess I can't blame Dubya for that one then.	I believe it was just called intercontinental.

Lord Shaxx weekly crucible bounties are impossible to complete on all three characters this week because there is a bounty that requires you to get the daily crucible reward for three days and you can only do that once per day on one character only Not sure if that's intentional or if it's an oversight from Bungie.

9883	People picked up the slack in preparation for Marilyn Manson's new album, "*Eat Me, Drink Me*" to be released in 2007.	What caused that little bump seen on almost all charts around 2006 area?

9887	Oh right, when she forgets why Iraq became a theatre of war, all she had to do is [bleep bloop] check her decades' old emails for answers.	She was goddamn fucking Secretary of State of the United States of America. One of the most important cabinet positions and 4th in line in order of succession for the Presidency. Dealing with Iraq was one of the biggest things she, and every other SoS since 2002 has had to deal with, so she absolutely needed memos like this to have a clear picture of what happened. Might she also have been aware of its political potential? Sure.
9888	I am outraged	Mets expected to bring back Terry Collins in 2016
9889	I'm not saying the government should censor him, I'm petitioning private corporations to remove their support, which is well within my right to do and well within their rights to do or not do.	"I don't like what this guy's saying so he shouldn't be allowed to be heard" is a pretty concerning sentiment.
9890	We need to arm all our school teachers with swords and halberds this instant.	Ultimately it's best not to focus on the killer. I'd rather know more about those killed and what we can do to stop this from happening again.
9891	My roommate is Mexican and uses Android Pay at most of the places I use it.	I'm waiting for the feature that will let you pay without having to be American.
9892	more like best cal	So-Cal?
9893	I'm glad these hardened criminals are off the street.	"POLICE HARASSMENT For Ordering A LYFT At The Airport". Cop claims he must impound car because customer is filming interaction. OP's YouTube summary states police tried deleting his video.
9894	And the stupid normie SLUTS with internalized-misogyny who give the cis males their families!	I don't think the loony bin-tier radfems hate the concept of "family" so much as they hate the fact that men are allowed to be a part of them.
9895	yay smd soldering	Just think, they could have bought them a new HDMI slot for literally hundreds of times less. No idea how it could be soldered on though, HDMI cables have like 30 wires inside.
9896	Yeah, it sucks that Jon Stewart's dead.	No mate. lol I know this is a joke, but I've never had any interest in politics apart from the presidential stuff in America, and only because of people like Jon Stewart's coverage on them.
9897	found the leaver	This is why I don't report leavers. You don't know what shit is going on on the other side, although it probably isn't rape.
9898	Tire and rim look like they're still good.	CS: Ball joint failure at highway speed
9899	Messi of course!	Could one of the people calling for a marquee signing that scores more goals, explain to me who exactly they want to sign? Not a fantasy signing either, someone who realistically fits the team.
9900	I use Wifi calling on EE and I don't seem to get that problem, my issue is if the wireless drops, the call does, rather than switch to 4G.	T-Mobile WiFi Calling Anybody use T-Mobile's wifi calling? It SEEMS that it kills my internet connection when it's on. My 50Mbps connection goes down to 10 or less. I'm using the 9 beta, so I'm unsure if this is a bug in 9, or just the way it is. Anybody else use this feature? Do you have any problems?
9901	Omg no you'll have to sell your house in order to afford to maintain it!	2002 BMW 325i as my first car? Someone I know is offering to sell me his 2002 silver BMW 325i. I test drove it on the streets and the freeway; it felt really smooth and I liked the purr of the engine. He took really good care of the car: the interior is still almost perfect with no rips, outside has no visible scratches and intact paint. He's kept up with all the maintenance and the car hasn't seen any huge problems over its 150k lifetime. He's asking $4000 for it. Do you think this is a good deal?
9902	They also fund mass murder but we have roads so no biggie	Thank you! It feels like everyone is always complaining about taxes and the government stealing money, but they do actually provide benefits to society!
9903	I guess you need to start listening to better music then.	Doesn't have all genres though. No country or alt country is what I've noticed.
9904	LUCKY they could afford good solicitors	Pirate Bay Founders Acquitted in Criminal Copyright Case
9905	#autismmasterrace	This is Tumblr, however, where mental disorders make you part of the glorious master race.
9906	On Women Laughing Alone With Salad.	For those of you that are in stock photos, where was the weirdest place you saw your picture used?
9907	Here, I think somebody dropped this:	Did not realize it was a joke, thought you were being cynical.
9908	Your right, we have just as much to gain as your vastly larger economy and population has...	Oh please, your leaders are just as happy to do it, I'm sure there are big profits in it for them.
9909	I bet you've got tons of data to back that up	Yeah but most of the time they are legit good and professional players, most girls (a few exceptions) only receive money because tits.

9911	nobody wants the overrated QB.	If anyone says Namath I will fucking cut you
9912	Note how neither one mentions LeBron in their top 5	Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain talk about their rivalry, free throws, how would they play against Shaq, and name their top 5 players of all time. 1997
9913	That name is most appropriate for what you've said	Kind of rude to make a sign like that generalizing the beliefs of every New Zealander. Also a bit cringeworthy. The whole anti tpp thing seems to be riddled with idealistic students.
9914	They're just making sure no one confuses her with all those male journalists named Kristen...	You don't need to specify "female" before journalist. It has nothing to do with the story and assumes a male norm. Plus her name and the use of "she" and "her" demonstrate she is a female on their own.
9915	"City of Brotherly Love"	HitchBOT destroyed in Philadelphia, ending U.S. tour
9916	Yeah, it's the panel of impartial citizens that's the problem.	California senators approve ban on grand jury investigations into police deaths
9917	I think ugly people are disgusting and shouldn't be allowed in public	This isn't about legality, it's about public use.
9918	But the fees are for public protection!	Ride sharing companies should pay the same fees? How about not making the taxi companies pay the fees? If you don't want unfair competition, get rid of unpopular rules.
9919	Replace it bro.	Hail damage on Carbon Bicycle fork - sorry new to carbon bikes - should I be worried?
9920	- Getting used to Linux, I've wanted to learn it for a while - Programming - Bit of gaming - Most of my tasks, except gaming, because DX12 (I know there's no DX12 games yet, though) - I'm paranoid, so security stuff in Win10 makes me want to use it for nothing except gaming while I wait for things to clear up on the security issues, and I have a chance to knuckle down and get it suited to my needs.	What will you be using the linux install for?
9921	Good thing the mods enforce those sub rules.	PPD: "Blue-pillers" are asked why there are so many angry men on TRP. TeRPers flood to the thread to blame women, feminism, society, etc. "Nice Guy" behavior abounds!
9922	so cringy.....	Cunning Edge Journalism from the Wall Street Journal

9927	You mean "showing dedication"?	Even if it exposes an airplane full of people, his/her team, and the client to whatever illness he may have?
9928	Just talk business with everyone who calls and youll be fine	Do I pay cellphone bill with business account or personal account I'm a new sole proprietor, I've just learned if you're using your cellphone for both business and personal you can only deduct a percentage for business during tax time. But, what account do I pay out of for the monthly billing?
9929	You clickbaiter son of a bitch!	Nope :(. The Battlefront picture is just my desktop background.
9930	This is why I disagree with the bo5 format, it doesn't truly show how well teams could adapt between games, if it was a bo7, it would have been tsm 4:3 if they figured out not to let pobelter on Viktor in tthat fourth game	The best strat is to go 0/3 and get those last two wins with all the knowledge you've gained, it worked for TSM!
9931	Yea, shit with purple and green stats respectively.	The point of XVM is to see who's good so you can prioritize targets. win% doesn't mean shit. I just use it to see how aggressive or how passive I should be playing. If you don't use XVM, people still see your stats. Also, don't watch quickybaby or jingles. They are shit at the game. Watch zeven, sirfoch, sela
9932	But it's such a funny meme!	Dae Nokia phones are strong
9933	Also, eliminate the word "cabbage", as long as we're arbitrarily deciding what words sound stupid.	Really?

9941	...but have you changed your clock yet?	That's your mom dude. That is what they do. My mom still reminds me every year to change my damn clock for day light savings time
9942	Do you have full maintenance records?	Purchase advice - 2004 LS 430 ~$12,000, 135,000 miles I'm looking to buy this vehicle, but would appreciate help on common problems, things to look out for, and pricing ideas. I saw the car in person last week, and it looks/drives good. Ran it over a few bumps during the test drive, and didn't hear any problems. I know the control arm bushings have been a problem, but I didn't hear any issues during the drive. All electrical/mechanical systems seemed to work well. I've also heard about hesitation when you hit the gas at low speeds, but it wasn't out of the ordinary from what I felt. I plan on getting a PPI before buying. Does anyone have experience with these vehicles and know common problems to look out for? The one item I need to look into is the transmission, apparently there were two recalls for this year. Also, thoughts about the price? It seems high.

9948	Knowing is half the battle ;)	Oh my bad. I'm kind of a dumbass.
9949	Yeah friend and I had the prediction that Kylo was a solo twin.	Most people familiar with the old EU had this theory - really isnt that crazy to predict it.
9950	You've only got one name?	I am McLovin, the 25 year old organ donor from North Dakota
9951	I don't doubt you- thank you for the explanation!	I was a small PC shop up until about a year ago. It may be true for current OS versions, I don't know. But I never had to register the business or update a bios with windows 7 or 8.
9952	Harry hater is the viral sensation the world deserves.	He's no Harry Hater

9956	Kansas City has one now.	A fancy theater where you sit at tables, can order food and drinks during the movie, and they have waiters bring it out to you. They're pretty big in Austin, and they have them other places in Texas, but I haven't heard much about anywhere else
9957	Yeah nobody voted for shitty politicians in Europe.	many in the US blindly follow what their politician and media tell them to do
9958	When I worked at a non-profit I was drug tested.	I have never worked in a bank that drug tested and I've been in shitty shops pushing loans to mid bracket banks with 5 billion under management selling private placements, I never got tested once, not even to get licensed. I know it's a thing but I've never had to take one in my entire life. I always figured it was for jobs that were insured, like a Doctor or Construction Worker.
9959	I feel thinking things through isn't one of his strengths	Idiot blurs his face but if go to his YouTube chanel and it has is full name and face pic .
9960	The Courier's 3A (335MJ) shield is actually stronger than a Clipper's 7A (306MJ).	10% more shields? I seem to pop Courier shields in a couple seconds, but I generally have to wail on Vultures a few times longer at least to get them down - and the Courier's hull feels papery compared to Vultures, when attacking them. Huh.
9961	There are plenty of adults who should seek out info about autism, as they could be outside of that period of time where they wouldn't have been diagnosed(ie, now).	Worth it if it helps those kids.
9962	They can only raise rates if you let them - either by trusting free market forces as some regions have done, or by regulators allowing it.	and a power plant is going to do what with this added tax? You think they are going to eat it or raise your power rate? Another stupid idea
9963	It's so expected, I almost have to feign excitement	I just messaged a friend that Murphy didn't look surprised either. His face was like, "ok, whatever."
9964	I SHALL NOT FEAR, FEAR IS THE MIND KILLER.	I shall no longer be scared
9965	Is the difference between the 280 and the 280x that big coz i can run most games so close to ultra (cod aw, shadow of mordor) at 60 fps	It actually depends on what games you play. I have a 280 and find that I have to turn down some settings on a few games to reach 60fps, but I won't be upgrading to a better card any time soon. If you're happy with your 270x and how it performs, you might want to wait for the new cards releasing this year.
9966	What's with all these old shows and movies copying Archer?	This scene from Magnum PI might look familiar to Archer fans. (This is just a working title, of course)
9967	Hey kootchi knows the glory of vibrations, just not sure how it helps men	Oh, my sweet, naive kootchi, you have so much to learn.
9968	Condenser to make water and right into the waste water line for the washer right next to it?	Seems interesting but with all big claims should be equal skepticism. For instance, where will all of this humidity go? In his prototype, he just had a small piece of fabric. When this is dried, the water can easily be dispersed in the air. But imagine a big load of laundry drying, they will have to find a way to vent the humidity.
9969	Interesting... There is a person in the demon as well calling that person the demons inner demon?	"Inner Demon"
9970	Oh snap I beat him	First MUT 16 H2H right now.. And facing Rose Bowl... FML.

9973	:(	USD/CAD highest levels since 2004!
9974	And I mean while he's at it he should probably just make his own kernel, OS, drivers, and the whole bunch, because you know, it's possible for anyone with enough time to figure it out on their own.	No, you literally brought that up yourself in your post. So, why don't you do it yourself?
9975	It's MST3K with 9/11 and child rape jokes.	Guessin these are like MST3K? Or Rifftrax
9976	Didn't you know that when air is pumped out of a room, gravity gets afraid of the vacuum and leaves?	The flat earth people are fun to watch too.
9977	Doesn't mean it's ok to start shit even if someone doesn't mind... that's part of being an adult.	Yeah exactly, if the person on the receiving end doesn't mind then no harm done.
9978	It is all a CFC plot against gelvon because the devs are all on their side!	And his sperg grew 3 sizes that day

9984	How can she cold?	"did it cold?"
9985	Because government efficiency?	Scumbag US Passport Agency: They have one job. I've paid them to do it. And they're not doing it.
9986	Yeah better afk and lose for sure then trying to win with someone without Thunderlord	Can Keystone masteries be shown before we get into the game?
9987	yes it includes music freedom and even data stash.	you seemed pretty quick, and I'm trying to figure this out: does it also come with music freedom?
9988	Ashamed Brazilians	Thanks for answering; I don't know why you're getting downvoted :(
9989	Because they happen to be square?	These Floating Fountains in Osaka look like Borg ships...
9990	They will draw 0-0	Ahhhh, cheer up bud. You aren't that bad :)
9991	Bill Clinton got total respect from reactionary right-wingers.	Well, that president was white.
9992	Trade for Brian Hoyer and a draft pick.	What do you suppose the team does to win then, Coach Jlogizzle?
9993	Is he talking about Tom Brady?	"both the best player and the best cheater most of us will ever see" Well said
9994	Custard between, cream on top is how we do it in northern Germany.	Add a layer of whipped cream between the strawberries and cake and this is my jam.
9995	This is the "up time" counter for humans... Shit, I should really reboot, I think there have been some bad memory leaks recently.	Find your 1-Billionth-Second Birthday (and your age in seconds)
9996	Nah man, we have to be more grateful so they stop beating us (or murdering children).	Ya...I'm gonna go with body cameras and better oversight/independent commissions.
9997	You must be sad or stupid for liking troll videos, because you know, those are really the only two adjectives you can use to describe the video game community.	I like Daniel's videos. I think they are very funny.
9998	dick cheney mixed with emperor palpatine	I'm trying to educate myself about my neighbors up North. As an American, which one of our politicians would you compare Harper to?
9999	Time zones are difficult.	So why are you at home on a Friday night?
10000	I want him to hold my hand the same way he did to Ska after that battle..	Bae 1v1s Scott
10001	Unlock your frame rate to unlimited in the graphics settings	I doubt it. I am using an AMD r9 290x, and I have crashed on the inventory screen a number of times now.
10002	Yupp, I should probably make some friends up there to keep one for me haha	Only a couple more years until you guys start getting them. Until then they'll still be cheap up here :D
10003	TIL Racial discrimination and Paying for public transport are linked	Part four of the constitutional rights guy...
10004	TIL trucks are slow.	Nope, better to have a kid in a slower car/truck, than a dead kid.
10005	And before that you only needed one ATT any way.	Oh wait not anymore.... C42 passed it's all incorporated into his RPal
10006	Very serious.. So lets punish the driver instead of the team.	Max Verstappen has been given a drive thru penalty, to be served in first 3 laps, for an unsafe release. The FIA took it very seriously when it discovered that he had been sent out with an unsecured engine cover.
10007	i too had a hell of a time understanding what he was saying	Australian TV journalist interviews "racist" homeowner who won't sell his home to "Asians". It has the most hilarious ending
10008	It's the revenge of Aztec god "Noerapenal"	Where did The Netherlands go wrong? I'm an armchair Dutch supporter and having watched Holland's recent defeats I'm wondering what people think the real problem is behind this Tterrible run is?
10009	Thank you for the mental image.	let me know if you find my jolly rancher
10010	Couldn't find it in comment section, gracias!	Totally has'nt been a popular subject around here.
10011	We *definitely* need more Agario clones in the Play Store, because there's *obviously* not enough.	Gravitation: Just like Agario, but 3D and cooler!
10012	And what's the problem with that, you racist?	I find it truly disgusting. Our ancestors died to protect our lands and culture. Now the politicians are just giving it away.
10013	It's impossible to be sexist against men, just like it's impossible to be racist against Caucasians.	What a bunch of sexist bullshit.
10014	I think you dropped your	Connection errors don't happen that often.
10015	Make new friends!	I'm having a friend for dinner and any amount of spicy or strongly seasoned food makes her sick. What should I make? She's a good friend and I want to make something she can eat. To be clear, I made impromptu nachos once with one can of regular Rotel and she said it was almost too hot. She doesn't even use black pepper much. Other than that, she doesn't have dietary restrictions. To add to the complications, we're mostly vegetarian, though we'll rarely eat chicken. No red meat or fish. What food would you make in this situation?
10016	I feel both of you are correct xD	To be honest the title is even funnier if you leave out the part about the price.
10017	You cannot outrun your fork, period.	Nobody is a dedicated runner for 10 years and is that over weight. Im sorry but thats just ridiculous. Fucking hams and their lies.
10018	123 kappa Thanks for doing this OP!	Steam Cash Giveaway! Pick number between 1-10,000
10019	Then why post it at all?	Because then OP wouldn't get to keep it since the owner is highly unlikely to see this post.
10020	Yeah, smoking weed is so much worse than killing people with the crown of your helmet	Can't be any worse than when you signed Will Hill. Now he's a real piece of shit.
10021	You missed the	No. Usually the women and the men worship in separate rooms or areas IIRC from my trip to Dubai
10022	So now i can spam torps at my friends and nobody wud care	or, just disable the whole team damage idea. would make for a better experience for every player.
10023	But its easy to win at Roulette, you wait for 3 Black Numbers to hit, then bet on Red, right?	Worse than roulette? Come on. Maybe about the same as blackjack.
10024	is that the one with secret keeper instead of mysterious challenger?	Martin Uther King *Jr.*
10025	Bielema has said he wears the jacket for luck out of some weird superstition, considering he already has 3 SEC wins in less than 3 years I would say its working just fine....keep the good luck flowing.	Half the coaches in football and managers in baseball do that. Bielema was out there with a jacket in August. I don't get it.
10026	You did!	Did we see Martavais Bryant there as well?
10027	oh man a libertarian is here to save us all from 1984!	You might want to think about a bigger factor if you care at all about the ability of future generations to act with agency.
10028	No that's SELinux.	Yeah, like how absolutely nobody ever believed that systemd was designed to include NSA surveillance tech.
10029	Like an Grommash reinhart skin?	Blizzard skins for Overwatch characters. I think there's a slight chance OW will end up looking a lot like FPS HotS and that would ruin the game for me.
10030	But then how would Owens win?	I don't understand why he doesn't 'cheat' to win more. For example Kevin Owens raking The Ryback's eyes to win the Intercontinental title, it was played off as cunning and great ring awareness, this is how Seth should be winning matches. Grabbing the tights, using the ropes, brass knuckles, rather than just lose every week!
10031	You should come see my lads in our sunday league, very unpredictable results.	I don't know, as a neutral it's boring when the only question is by how much Bayern will win.
10032	Oh, like yours was a bombshell.	That comment was definitely not a dud.
10033	I mean Brandish had a relation with Layla so she's reliving it with Lucy	I know countless others who are mad about it.
10034	Nice post, trying to out the managers among us ;-)	How did you get to your management position? Hey guys - I've got a different kind of question today. I'm interested how you guys got into your management or c-level positions running network or infrastructure teams. What are your roles and responsibilities, how did the interview go (what were the typical topics etc.), how many people do you manage, what were your credentials when you obtained your position etc. I'm considered a 'high level delivery engineer' or specifically a 'technology architect' for a VAR and would eventually like to settle down into a management position with a team to lead. I'm trying to figure out when it would make sense for me to potentially try to obtain such a role. Thanks for any and all information - i'll respond to any questions you guys have of me.
10035	Makes sense, not like he's talking tough internally or committing us to combat roles in foreign countries.	Harper has screwed the military and veterans for his entire reign of error.
10036	Wow no one could have seen this coming!	Frustrated migrants take refugee centre to court -
10037	Who doesn't want paper sticking to their wounds?	They should put confetti in air bags to make car accidents more fun.
10038	Then you must be lesbo.	Well that's not nice. And actually, I'm female. Thanks for asking.
10039	Reek* hes implying it will smell of havoc when EDG wins	Wreak*
10040	fucking hate you masochist types...	anyone on tumblr in 2012 knows. That was when you "had" to reblog a post if it had a picture of tumblr's creator (who they called "daddy") source: been there since 2011. hated it since 2011. still there.
10041	It's also very low-cost!	Smoking, it gives you an immediate in with other people who smoke, with the downside of cancer ^oh ^well
10042	reporting for win trading :)	Back to the days where 5mal HL was possible we manage to Q 2 different 5man parties and get Qed on the same match, but never this.
10043	I heard on Facebook that he plans to rule from a cave in Afghanistan.	Justin Trudeau won't move in to 24 Sussex, says Margaret Trudeau
10044	Yes, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the like have become fabulously wealthy because international corporations are stealing the oil.	The US, and the UK have a very long history of supporting the most violent fringes of Islamic theocracy in the middle east, because they were the counterpoint to secular nationalist movements, that wanted to nationalize their natural resources, and use it to improve their own countries, instead of letting international business interests steal it. So that's how.

10046	But they support gay marriage and legal weed, they can't possibly be right-wing!	I say this every time I can, but for some reason there still exists this overarching idea that Reddit is some kind of liberal bastion. If all you look at is r/politics then maybe, but otherwise I've never seen evidence of it. Reddit skews conservative on almost every issue.

If you've noticed the subreddit looking a little off, Yeah sorry about that. I deleted somethings while trying to get the flairs to work and apparently I deleted the wrong things. I'm not sure when it'll be fixed but for the time being, you can put the blame on me for how the subreddit looks a bit off.

10052	What kind of oil?	Ooooh maybe I can tell my story. Many years ago I was lying down in bed to listen to some music before I went to sleep. I grabbed my HD 280 Pros to put over my lovely sweet ears. Then I heard a loud woosh and felt something in my ear. The fuck was that? Then I proceeded to feel a large pain in my ear and a loud VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV. There was a god damn moth in my ear. I flipped the fuck out and ran to the shower and filled my ear up with water but that just made it angry. Had to get someone to drive me to the A&amp;E cos I was freaking out so bad. I know now that if it happens again I should fill my ear up with OIL to drown the critter and it should slide out with the oil. Happy listening everyone.

10058	Yea, if only the police would be nicer to the drug addicts the world would be a better place.	I agree that forced hospitalization is a good thing but those days are over now that we have abandoned that option in favor of incarceration. As for police being overwhelmed, that is complete bull shit. Police are overpaid, steroid induced children with guns. It's their job to take care of these things and instead of doing that they let their guns speak for them. I'm not saying that police are the cause or solution but they are rabid dogs, salivating at the chance to shoot someone and that just makes matters worse. We need to reintroduce compassionate care for the severe mentally ill, housing and assistance for the homeless that need it, treatment for those who would benefit it, and safety from psycho police and better training and respect for a new police force that are properly trained, and thoroughly screened against the behavior patterns of today's out of control police force (meaning fire every last culpable one, there are no good cops anymore).

10082	So what you're saying is that raids sucked back then and it's just nostalgia that keeps us from looking criticly at them?	Dear god please don't. The timewalking right now already shows how bad the quality of the indtances was compared to now. Remember the upscaled molten core? I could see myself enjoying it once per instance, but then never let me touch it again. I have farmed most of those instances already and I don't want to farm them again.

Hi, I'm ADC main and getting sent into toplane is my bane. I cant play that role at all, I used to play Quinn there but since her rework its not that good anymore. In the Aram I happened to play Jayce, and I liked that I could do it almost same way as ADC if I just stay on cannon stance. So, your toughts, is Jayce top worth learning?

10126	Being good is the counter to quickscoping	Yeah, it was a very annoying trend in BO2. The game was awesome, but those kids would practice the quick scoping mechanic deal and get it down to a science. In the right hands, sniping has no counter.

If the standard for "are you a feminist" is going to be "do you believe men and women should be equal" she *is* a feminist, full stop. Feminism cannot simultaneously claim the broad mandate of "anyone who believes in equality is a feminist" *and* narrow membership to "only people who believe in equality and advocate it in the following way and win the following focus."

10138	No, it was also because at that point, he was selling lots of toys and killing Ford off would be bad business.	I don't know. It's certainly possible. I will point out though that the reasoning that Harrison Ford saying that the script 'felt right', is a bit of a red herring. It is widely known that Ford wanted Solo to be killed off in Jedi, but it has also been said that it wasn't something that he was insistent upon. I believe it was Kasdan who gave an interview (I'll try to find it later) not too long ago saying that, yes Ford did want Solo to die, but when he told Lucas this, Lucas explained to him why he wasn't going to kill anyone off and that Ford agreed with that reasoning. mainly Lucas didn't want there to be any down notes to the ending of the film. He wanted it to be a definite victory for the good guys.

10143	If you cut yourself for attention you *do* have a real problem.	If high school taught me anything, it's that situations like this typically have a backstory. My guess is she has a history of attention seeking shenanigans and people that know her are tired of it. The more outgoing guys had a field day with it. Or they could just be assholes and she has a real problem. Ya never know

For all you people saying you can't play as an asshole... ...we all play as an asshole. Think of it. You help a settlement, and demand to use their workbench, then come in and scrap all their shit and take supplies. If they're lucky, you build them some crops to slave over or make them stand in a damn tower 24/7. What they don't eat, they sell and give you what seems to be all of the money left over. You come and go as you please, abandoning your friends and ignoring them for months on end after ordering them to leave their homes and live at a random place. You pay Macready like 200 caps to follow you around the rest of his life. You make them carry your shit, let them get shot instead of you, AND when you don't want them around anymore you make them go wherever you please, even if it's across the damn map. Even if they love you. And when someone asks you to do something, you may sometimes leave it incomplete for months at a time. For such a nice guy, the SS is a selfish asshole. (I know this doesn't make up for the lack of evil choices, just something funny I've noticed.)
10147	digging up minerals, which are then refined and used to craft better guns.	Do you know what a pickaxe is used for?
10148	I don't think Jan Vesely will be a huge threat	Actually I disagree. His best chance was 2 seasons ago when his competition was Hibbert and Al Jefferson. Now he has Drummond, JV, Whiteside, Horford, Monroe(?), Brook Lopez (?), and Porzingis now and going forward. That's a very heavy competition for the future and now.

10154	It's worth noting that TESO takes place hundreds of years before Skyrim.	I broke and got it a few months back when it was on sale. I came in very pessimestic, and was in general very impressed by it. It is fun, don't get me wrong. It has amazing storytelling, and fantastic quests in general, better than skyrim, arguably. The tiny unique details and stories are there, just as you'd expect. The lore is amazing, although some things they changed that don't match other games, like in Skyrim, Morvunskar is an abandoned fort, yet in ESO it suddenly is a village/tomb kind of thing. Because it is an MMO, there are players with you doing the smae thing you are, and its hard to get super immersed like you can in Skyrim. Big quests and dungeons are often anticlimatic as well. For example, you are in the Ebonheart Pact, and the Daggerfall Covenent is attacking the city! You have to fight bravely to the Daggerfall ships, board it, and an NPC tells you that you are close to saving the city!! Just run inside the ship and kill the general! So you go inside expecting a tough final battle, but what do you see? 30 people just standing around inside, no general. A few seconds later the general respawns, is instantly killed by the 30 people who are farming him, and you finish the quest. Talk about lame ass shit. I was so let down when this happened. It is a very good MMO though, with very good PvP and an incredibly complex and complicated crafting system. Just so happens that I don't have the interest or the time for MMO's. I had a good time playing it for about 2 weeks but now it just collects dust in my steam library.

10157	Immigrated to Vancouver in 97, and would choose it 10 out of 10 times.	If you could immigrate to Canada all over again (or move within Canada) where would you move to? Hey folks, I'm from Scotland, interested in moving to Canada some day. in 3 years or so. I'm an electrical technician so with a trade I doubt getting in would be too much of a problem. I've only been to two places in Canada, Toronto and Vancouver. I was 9 when I went to Toronto so I don't remember too much about the city, weather and the people. I went to Vancouver June just past and I loved the place, it's scenery, the people seemed very nice, the quality of live, the diversity all struck a good cord with me. I know Canada is a big place, so where other than Vancouver or Toronto would you recommend? Or if you could do it all over again, where would you move to and why? I like the busy city feel but knowing I'm not far from the outdoors so I can escape, hence why I liked Vancouver.

10176	They could do Maidan thing if they wanted change, you know :)	If you seriously think that the people control what the government does you are seriously misinformed, especially in America, where the two party system means they get two parties with two different opinions on subjects, so often it's less "I like this party" and more "this party is better than the alternative".
10177	Like I said, local places are the best, but they're not gonna deliver to your house on a Sunday at 1am.	I had it a few times over the past couple years, and it's too inconsistent. Sometimes it's decent, and other times it sucks. Pizza Hut can suck a dick, I'm sticking to local places.
10178	Pooping	Reddit, why are you here?
10179	Everyone knows luchadores don't exist.	Why? Wrestling is still big in mexico and they all wear masks.
10180	So what you're really hoping for is a Furion EE, right?	When will my meiran get an ee ;A; ~~is2g if our next ww ee is vivid fear I will flip shit~~
10181	But the homeless people are the scum and filths of the society	A wonderful thing. Maybe he should ask the members of Congress to join. "Hey guys, come see the people you represent. Sit down at the table with them. Afterward, you should contemplate on if you're doing a good job or not."
10182	Remember, his account was worth hundreds of dollars!	Your lawyer deals with that. Just keep in mind, suing might cost you more than your account is worth. If you do decide to sue, listen to your lawyer's advice, and not people on the internet.
10183	Destiny ripped off halos amazing shooting mechanics though so I hate it	Dude who cares? By that logic Bungie ripped off pretty much anything. Same goes to other games
10184	Come on those aren't big names	"Less big player transfers"
10185	My GOD, heterosexual breeding between extinct, non-sapient animals triggers my PTSD.	I wonder what that luny feminist would have to say about this... lol
10186	Now I'm just afraid.	Or maybe, just maybe...the child has mutant powers of magnetism. Shit just got real.
10187	#Whoops, wrong sub, right title.	28 Years Later Trailer
10188	Reinvest it into my other lineups.	What do you do with your Rem. Salary?? So you pick the team you feel comfortable with and you have $100-$300 or so in rem. salary. Do you ignore it because this is the team you want or do you think there is always room for improvement and you try to use everything you have?
10189	Yeah sure..	This sub does not get sarcasm whatsoever.
10190	But if we restrict gun access then people won't have guns to defend themselves from other people who also wouldn't have guns.	Can we all agree that whatever his beliefs, the bigger issue here is that here's a guy with a severe learning difficulty of some kind, who was possibly mentally ill, yet was able to own 13 guns. From an outsiders perspective (I'm from the UK) American gun laws make zero sense.
10191	It's Smith's fault.	He's getting double and triple teamed at the line and Alex hasn't had time to watch for him to get free
10192	Yeah, all those messages she keeps sending to him with overt sexual innuendo is what keeps him coming back, not mental problems.	Maybe if you STOPPED LEADING HIM ON.
10193	Speaking of B4, what's the main draw of it vs smaller firms?	Yes but do you know when I will hear back from the Big4 recruiter? I was thinking I might just track her address down and go to her house to make sure I'm still in the running. What you say?
10194	Please, don't be redicullous that would never work if we follow the model of gender studies and focus on differences in every field then we can maybe make as many amazing advaces as they have.	It's almost as if we'd all be better off by working together to make things better for everyone...
10195	Just take the green line!	Memphian here. That's one thing that holds us back from being a *great* city-- public transit. MATA buses don't cut it.
10196	morales will teach everyone map awareness the hard way	Pushing core with dropship
10197	99 summoning cause i have lots of cats which i talk too	Does anyone else think about if you were a RuneScape character irl, what your stats would be? 99 strength for me obv
10198	Well, this is the MTG subreddit after all.	Can't believe you got down voted for just calling a new non basic some name that people don't agree with.
10199	HE MEANT WEDNESDAY, geez,	In the hour after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent a tweet congratulating the Astros on reaching ALCS and calling a matchup with the Rangers, the two teams gave up a combined 14 runs. Tweet text (now deleted): **Congrats to the @astros on advancing to the ALCS!. Hoping for an all-Texas #ALCS. Looking at you @Rangers.**
10200	It's a baby fuckin whale man!	In a rare encounter, divers come face-to-face with an enormous Sunfish
10201	That was the one where Andrew Jackson went full Leonidas in New Orleans, right?	Well, the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War overshadowed everything else. Also, we lost in Crimean War and it was an expansionist war of Russian monarchy so it was not very popular in USSR, just like WW1 is quite a bit of an obscure topic for Russians. Compare with the Patriotic War of 1812 which is quite well known.
10202	The food was not Halal.	celle beautiful pictoresque old town. GREAT beer and food. Anybody got any context what that was about?
10203	I bet the simcity online matches are a perfectly fine experience.	Have the CEO of EA play a couple of online matches and see how handicapped it all is. Then chokeslam him for being a cunt
10204	Translation: Racist.	just a ''worried patriot''
10205	I wouldn't expect someone with a name such as probablydrunkrn1353 to *understand* the ways of Jesus Christ our Lord and savior!	Why can't they just have sex? It seems easier than just lying to yourself about it
10206	You just don't under physics very well if you think that split second is going to do much to 260lbs going the other direction.	I don't understand what you're getting at.
10207	Byzantine is not even country.	Pluto is not even planet.
10208	I was referring more to modern comedy- Melissa McCarthy sure as shit isn't Lucille Ball.	Have you seriously never seen I Love Lucy?
10209	Common sense dont reals	"Graduates don't know what "race" and "ethnicity" are. #America"
10210	The CEO of reddit is allowing the specter of "language police coming to knock the door down" to dictate actual policy.	And Reddit says this site is run by SJWs.
10211	To be fair, he did say he bought armor	Please don't be this guy.
10212	But those authors are wymyn and therefore incapable of being creepy.	Stupid getting smacked down. How John Green is probably NOT a pedophile.
10213	Because they didn't want to see one of their own take his life and not get prosecuted.	Nobody actually thinks they wanted to assist this guy by giving him space to kill her. The outrage comes from the fact that they spent a half hour letting her bleed out and not attempting to render aid because they were negotiating with him rather than shooting him.
10214	Yeah pretty much	because it's impossible to have a gf with 99 slayer
10215	Ctrl + F is extremely useful on reddit for browsing through the endless comments!	What are some keyboard commands for browsing the internet? The best one I know is ctrl+shift+t to reopen closed tabs. I'm interested in expanding my knowledge though, you got some good ones?
10216	Well you don't expect a Mac to use that inferior IP address Windows uses, do you?	IT teacher here a week ago a 'person' told me MAC address is APPLE technology people cant even wikipedia these days
10217	I don't see why not.	If I preorder BO3 today, will I still get into the beta?
10218	He just needs to remember whose lives really matter.	Maybe the Berning Man has a chance after all.
10219	yeah sure send me the offer for serpent 92k + 260 k = 352 ofc I would take that offer	ak serpent mw 0,11 float +260k?
10220	Uhm hello, he's like an 86 on fifa	I'd say Cech is an equal second to Courtouis. People seem to always ignore Lloris' mistakes.
10221	Like the Greek Communist party?	Blame the people for voting into power again and again governments that would do nothing to combat corruption. Believe it or not, there ARE Greek parties that preached fiscal responsibility before the crisis, but of course why would anywone want to elect a party that wants to collect due taxes ....
10222	Because you downvote non contrubutions to the thread and not opinions or ideologies	Why would someone downvote this post?.. Some people are dumb haha.
10223	What's that?	Thought they'd at least have Westchester... We're so left out :/
10224	It's not like the subreddit has 20+ posts per hour about the tourney mode as it is.	Is anyone else annoyed by Smash 4's new tourney mode?
10225	It might cover that side trip to McDonald's too, obviously.	But they're not profiting. I've asked you several times if you think $30-$100 is reasonable compensation for shipping/transport. You can not provide me with anything that says this is out of line. So, tell me how they are "profiting"?
10226	Blacks can't be racist, so this is okay.	Participants of the Movement for Black Lives conference harassed Northeast Ohio Media Group reporter Brandon Blackwell for recording their public demonstration.
10227	*hug*	give me one
10228	Nah that nigga is dead.	I hope you survived that!
10229	Definitely sounds like a clear case of sleep paralysis or hypnogogic hallucinations.	I've got a question about sleep paralysis If this isn't the place for this topic, please direct me where I should take it. OK, so last night I was dreaming that I was trying to escape a demon. Towards the end of the dream, I was laying down to sleep and there were these two kids in the room doing the same. One of the kids asked if I would play with them tomorrow. Groggily, I said yes. They asked about playing in a pink room. Again, yes. Then I heard a deeper voice say something along the lines of good. At this point I'm thinking "wait, what?" After a couple of seconds where I can't move out open my eyes, I feel my bed dip down in front of where my shoulder is. I don't feel my shoulder move though. I start to hear a growl and as it continues I realize that it's me growling in real life. It was like some sort of switch. One second it's coming from right next to my ear, the next it's from my mouth. I focused on my growling and after a couple more seconds I can see and move again. I know it sounds more like an r/nosleep kind of post, but it's legitimate. I guess my question is, could this be an issue? Or would y'all say it's more of a dream combined with a bit of a sleep paralysis hallucination. I feel I should mention that I've had a couple more similar experiences.
10230	Yeah, that meeting where you sit down, watch the JFK assassination video, get told about our Alien overlords and the secret war in the hollow Earth, suddenly your transparency promises mean nothing	Yes, but aside from that he fell short on his transparency promises. He could very well have realized something we didn't once he got into office, but that still stands.
10231	Down voted for PHAT in a log	Araxxi Trifecta!!! And other drops from the last 2 days
10232	Much better that you see private photos they don't want you to, than sympathetically shot stuff within their control.	I might be shallow
10233	Yeah, and I'm sure your reaction times are incredibly quick!	To be honest most drivers I've known, myself included, drive safer when high. You drive at speed limit, you play games to stay straight within line, and you allow everyone in

10235	All of them, because they're elite athletes, and you're just well, an athlete.	Maybe at the 40...I run a 4:35 Mile.. Tell me how many O/D lineman can run that?
10236	STEFAN IS GOING TO KILL HIMSELF AT NUMBER 10, BUT HE REALLY LIKES BIRDS TOO.	This theory is a big stretch, but I dig your imaginative tone. I have always wondered about what Stefan might be counting off when he goes 1... 2....

10241	Not all calories are equal	I wonder if it has to do with the raw food angle. Like, "since it's raw it's so healthy most of those calories are negative so I need to eat 50% more." Or something.
10242	If I had to make a guess, I'd say during E3.	Does anyone know exactly when this will be happening?

10247	If you want to convey sarcasm just put a	It's an ironic joke.
10248	it's just momentum	Playing 12 minute quarters on HOF. Up by 20 at the half but the fucking Kings thought that they couldn't possibly lose this inter conference regular season game and decided to turn into the show time Lakers. They proceeded to shoot 83% over the next two quarters. 6 minutes into the 4th they had 60 something points (since the second half) and had only missed 5 shots in all of the second half.
10249	He's the only one that's capable of being a racist in that group.	You always have to have a token white man though. You might get called a racist otherwise.
10250	Jack Eichel doesn't fine the College Title Connor McDavid doesn't win the Robertson Cup IS THERE ANYONE WORTHY OF NUMBER 1 OVERALL	The Oshawa Generals have defeated the Erie Otters in 5 games and won the J. Ross Robertson Cup.
10251	I don't even get how that possible, sounds like a great bicep iso exercise	I finally saw it. A guy doing curls in the Smith machine
10252	Found shulk,rosa and lucario at nws	Has anyone ever found an exclusive at the wrong store? Maybe something went haywire during packaging and a lone lucario ended up at target or something. Just wondering. Also, while I'm asking this question, what would happen if you scanned an exclusive at the wrong store just for shits and giggles. Like would the transaction go through or what?
10253	Thank you for your informed opinion	It coming to NA is the horrible idea. NA is the most clique scene in CS, and if I had to guess could be one of the reasons why it's not considered to be as good as EU. The entire scene of NA plays out not too differently than a russian MM match.

10275	I think you may have found the reason he couldn't give a concrete example here...	What you are describing is a regular database. The blockchain does it in a "trustless" and "decentralized" way (though in reality, it's neither). There are many places where databases are useful, but there aren't that many places where they need to be trustless.

10289	Yeah, well, your *FACE* is stupid.	This is Reddit. America is always stupid.
10290	If the rest of the game is super polished, I don't think so.	Wouldn't holding back forge hurt Halo 5's reviews at launch? Reason I ask is because I just saw Frankie tweet how it was delayed for pacing the content. Pacing the content can be argued as being good or bad but 343 makes it out as a good thing (personally I dont care, I will be busy with other gametypes). I would think that people can agree that it will have an effect on review scores. Could you imagine if single, multiplayer, and warzone all pan out as 343 expects? This game will be a 9.5-9.8.If you then threw an awesome, revamped forge on top, this game could hit a perfect 10 and win GOTY and everybody would buy it. It just seems a bit of a risk to drop review scores just so gamers have a chance to acclimate to the new engine. My theory is that forge needs more polish, which is fine, but 343 is overly sensitive when it comes to admitting that a piece of their game isnt functioning correctly. I dont know why else they would risk it.
10291	Not nearly as impressive as Doug Baldwin's 3 game touchdown streak!	He only needs 16 receptions in the last three games to have the most receptions in a three year streak!?! Antonio Brown is awesome.
10292	That's very true.	Keep in mind that metacritic scores for movies before ~2000 don't really mean that much because they aggregate reviews written long after the movie's first release; critics only tend to write those re-reviews if they want to rave about the film. So you see a lot of 98s, 100s in those cases.
10293	double check that you are using a pc resolution and not the HD resolutions available, you might have to scroll down the resolution pop up menu in Nvidia settings	BenQ XL2430T doesn't work in 144hz when I have programs on other 60hz monitors. I always used to be able to play with 144hz on my main screen while on CS:GO and have a youtube video or whatever I wanted on my other screens while playing and it would have no effect on my main screens refresh rate. However now whenever I have programs open on the other two monitors while playing CS:GO (and only CS:GO) it drops to 60hz to match the refresh rate of the other two. I've tried changing options in NVidia's control panel and many other things yet I can't seem to fix it /;

10298	Wow the commentators reaction was so weak.	derrick favors dunk on kevin durant
10299	You haven't looked very hard then, there are plenty of people who've commented on here that they like the taste of KetoSoy.	Really? Keto Chow and Keto Fuel are widely considered to be the best-tasting ketogenic options out there - I've heard nothing but complaints about the taste of KetoSoy, if that's what you're used to. Keto Chow is designed to be used with heavy cream, but Keto Fuel is designed to be used with oil. The taste will be fine.
10300	But maybe the Cavs GM didnt know Wright was available until this posting...	I don't know why the cavs would sign someone and waive them 2 weeks later. They could have just signed Wright for the same money, I think they've already made up their minds.

10306	Yeah sadly that is true.	I agree, but we all know feels over reals now.
10307	I dunno, I like the card back for Hearthstone, and I don't play Heroes but I think the mount looks cool.	To their credit the rewards for the other games are also awful, save perhaps for the wow pet which has some novelty value and will probably be a good Pokemenz.
10308	Stop trying to corrupt me you heathen.	Oh c'mon now, you look better in PlayStation blue.
10309	He hates it because its common and tired so its cool and edgy to say you hate common phrases	Just out of curiosity, why do you hate it? I personally love it. Especially when working with new shooters. Helps lighten the mood a little. Keep your boogerhook off the bangswitch till your ready to fire. I also use "focus on the sticky-uppy thingy while you press through the hangy-downy thingy. That's what they are there for."

10311	You're right, if you can't see something it doesn't exist.	Nothing on the internet existed before I saw it. That's my favourite thing about it.
10312	There is a log target in rich rules you can make use of.	That's logging for firewalld itself. Not logging the packets that have been dropped, forwarded, accepted, and so forth.
10313	Because Israel is in danger from those filthy muslims....	I had a cousin tell me Pepsi stands for "Pay Every Penny to Save Israel"
10314	Mum and Dad pls no bully	Arabs, what do you refer to your parents as? Basically, me and my palastinian friend had a discussion and he revealed that he calls his parents by their first name which I found weird as usually, arabs have a respectful attitude towards adults, let alone your own parents. Is this common?
10315	They would buy 40 classic packs instead.	Nah, it would confuse new players.
10316	Close enough	You're supposed to hit it from the back, not hit her back bro.
10317	Damnit, you never mentioned a chinchilla!	A while ago my I got a kitten who bonded with my roommate's dog and I decided to document it.
10318	Nothing is as cool as killing innocents via drone strikes!	You guys have a goddamn cool President. The figurehead of your nation. Fuck Australian politics man.
10319	yeah but its new and stuff and 10%...	Yeah, and in the US it's similar. Also you can get a 750ti for like $50 less...
10320	Ah that would explain the ears then	Blue red panda I'm assuming.

I haven't gotten to really see either play. Though, I've watched a bit of Seager. I haven't seen a ton of his brother in that relationship.

10331	Its also a Percula clown, "Nemo" would be an Ocellaris	Hate to burst your bubble but that is a clownfish and a purple tang. Dori is a blue hippos tang. Still cute as fuh
10332	It's copyrighted	Wow. Why is that? Stifling professor's ability to speak freely if a recording could pop up later, or copyright issues for lecture materials?
10333	And if you enjoy going out, the bars in BG are awesome.	Not sure how far away you're willing to be, but Bowling Green is about 20-30 minutes away and is probably about as young and hip as you'll get in that area.
10334	I always enjoy a good firm slap.	I think slapping takes on a different meaning in Japan. Some enjoy it.
10335	But... But... You're a glory hunter!	You know what, I hate this idea that the only "legitimate" source of support is to your local club. Why is it that "I support (insert club) because they are my hometown team" seen as a legitimate reason while every other reason would get you labled as a plastic, glory hunter, or band wagoner. in the English game, I support Manchester City. Why? I'm a computer scientist by training, specializing in big data research. I support the use of analytics in sports, and I met a Manchester City executive at a conference. He outlined the novel ways Manchester City use analytics, and I fully agree with him. Soon they released the MCFC Analytics project, and I wholeheartedly support them. You see, we won't criticize our friends who enjoy cuisines, cars or ideologies not from their hometowns, why do we do it with sports? I say my favorite cuisine in Spanish, and nobody calls me a plastic spanish cuisine fan. I know a british communist, nobody attacks him over the fact that he supports an ideology created by two german guys. Location is not the only legitimate reason for someone to support a sports team. And we shouldn't attack fans who support other teams than their home town teams purely based on the fact that they aren't from the location. There are many other reasons why someone may support a club, and to me, it is all legitimate.
10336	That was a truck stop bathroom if I ever saw one, this girl is a lot lizard.	Maybe, just maybe, that wasn't her bathroom in her house. Maybe it was a bathroom in someone else's house. Wouldn't put it past this one to do something like that while being a guest somewhere.

With a price cap of $300, what is r/trees favorite vape?
10357	This is just the content that this subs needs to get rolling	You guys are everywhere. I can't escape.
10358	Ten years from now, it will be collectible, and you will sell it for a thousand dollars!	Is there any reason why this would be so expensive?
10359	I agree, the mafia is viewed as more, sophisticated, honorable, and intelligent.	Another example would be the mafia vs street gangs, the media loves to romanticize the mafia and and demonize street gangs even tho they basically do the same thing.
10360	Your facebook feed must be a lot of fun.	I have 3 family members currently "selling" these stupid fucking wraps. Two other friends selling Advocare's junk. Two other acquaintances selling some other diet drink mixes. SIL selling Scentsy. Another friend selling essential oils. Won't even delve into the ones selling Avon or Marykay or Pampered Chef. People that are otherwise very intelligent...I just don't get it.

10363	Getting off on the fact that you're so Masterful that you got random submissives you'll never meet to reveal their *deepest, most secretest* **desires** (ooh, aah).	Oh. ok.

10369	Cool thanks for the input!	It's been about a year since I switched to DSA, so to be honest I don't really remember what non-DSA sets feel like. But I don't recall it being particularly difficult typing on the DSA set when I first got it. They *look* very different, but I didn't notice much different in the typing aspect. YMMV though.
10370	FFS Ike why are you so easily comboed Can't escape a pm gaw or falco to save my life, pray for shield grabs lel	Pet peeves about characters you like? By that, I mean things that you don't like about characters that you enjoy playing otherwise. I have some pet peeves for quite a few characters, and I'll probably comment on this post if I figure out any others. Bowser Jr: Personally, Bowser Jr and the Koopalings are pretty fun characters to play (at least in local play modes, not so much in online play cause I suck at online in general), but WHY DOES THEIR UP SMASH SUCK SO MUCH?! It doesn't seem to do much damage or knockback, not even on All-Star mode where the CPUs take more damage and knockback! Luigi: It might not be a problem with the character himself, it might be just me, but I can't seem to get any upwards moment with Luigi Cyclone when I'm in the air! Which seems odd considering I've seen videos of people recovering onto the stage with Luigi Cyclone. (also if you can give me tips on how to do that, it would be appreciated.) That's all I can think of right now, but feel free to share yours!
10371	Works well in Mexico.	I don't think they should even be allowed to run re-election campaigns. Their voting record alone should stand up to whatever asshole #2 promises to do. Incumbent could get a % rating of what he promised to do versus what he did.
10372	Yeah it's oh so simple.	Yeah I'm pretty certain they are going to mess it up. Think about all the stuff you could add to space by simple scripting and they just don't do it or care about that. This is just gonna be another "rollercoaster attraction" and fix to tell people "look what we've added" while they don't add anything to the actual game.

A song of ice and fire changed my life, the show changed my life (Not meaning to sound dramatic), but they did. I'm sure I'll watch it. Thing is, some of the damage done to the plot seems irreversible. Is is that you believe the title hurts the article?

10377	Take a chill pill guys	Chill the hell out about the LA thing We **all** saw this coming. Spanos has made it known he wants to move. Most people in the know lately have been agreed that LA is going to be the Rams city. Spanos isn't just going to sit back and let the Rams be the only ones to file for relocation. We will not be the only ones either. Chargers, Rams, and Raiders will all file for relocation, we were just the first to announce it. This move is nothing more than Spanos and Fabiani covering all their bases. Relax and stop acting like the decision has been made already. The NFL will likely elect to have the Bolts stay in San Diego, if only because the city has been attempting to keep them. Inglewood is ready to put shovels in the dirt at any moment, and Oakland has done literally nothing to keep the Raiders. The NFL will very likely move the Rams to LA and work with the Raiders to find a new place to play. The Bolts aren't going anywhere, so please, calm down and stop adding "LA Chargers" to your posts.

If everyone who posted to fatpeoplehate and black people themed subreddits jumped ship reddit would become way better. The bullies and 4chan choads took over from the programmers that was reddits base when I started 7 years ago and it sucks. :(

Or, how about Reddit puts their dicks away and stop JERKING OFF BERNIE SANDERS ffs this site has literally become a Bernie circlejerk
10400	What a brilliant compromise, forcing him to have infinitely more children than he wanted	Apparently there's a compromise for childfree/child-wanting couples So my older brother (age 28) recently got engaged and did not really think about having the kids discussion beforehand. His fiancee wants children really badly and my brother does not want children ever. Oops. When discussing this with my mother and whether it would be a problem for their relationship, my mother says matter-of-factly, "don't worry, they'll just compromise." Apparently the compromise is just having one child. I tried explaining that you lose a lot of freedom by even having one kid and my mom responded with "what freedom does your brother need?????" It seemed really silly but it made me wonder how many people have been roped into the "compromise" of just having one child.
10401	And Republicans believe in Republics, because those two are mutually exclusive.	No, no, no. Democrats believe in democracy. Obama is just a totalitarian who pretends to be a democrat, and the liberals don't realize it because they are all too high.

10408	you forgot	TSM need roster change
10409	True; I keep forgetting we're the minority in most situations :/	We could, but you still run into the problem that in almost all markets with high spending power, it's the wife that decides what kind of interior your home will have. That's why LCDs sold so well even at massive premium and massively crappy quality early on. Wives rank "looks beautiful in my home" far higher than "has good image quality".
10410	Just because we are gay is no reason to discriminate against women when it comes to sex.	I'm a faggot, and actively choose to leave women out of my sex life, I can't prove I'm more of misogynist by doing anything else, don't you know gay men at literally the biggest shit lords on the planet. Especially when they are critical of all feminist exploiting gay men for a leg to stand on when they have none.

10421	Given that 1,300,000 die each year in traffic accidents, this kind of situation probably happens more often than one would like to think.	Guy severely mangled in truck crash slowly dying closeup. Pretty messed up.

10423	Five games over and I would be a happy camper.	What would you have considered a successful 2015 season before it started and how, if at all, has that changed recently? Basically just curious what the over all feeling around the knowledgeable fan base is. If your opinions have changed between Opening Day morning and now and what has made them change. I think an open discussion of what we're all expecting and hoping for this year would be good.
10424	Alright :)	That's what I'm talking about. If your friend needs something, all he has to do is open the chest and grab it. No mocking about with asking. No competing for resources.

10430	People play sober?	Who else plays better while under the influence? I'm not trying to be an edgelord, but I seem to play better when I'm fucked up. My guess is that when I'm more relaxed I don't overthink things and I just go with the flow of the fight.

10432	After you beat DLC, will you use build for PvP or PvE?	Save game rekt, need help choosing a new build So, after months of not playing, I wanted to continue DLC and the game doesn't recognize my save game. Guess I'll start over AGAIN... I need help deciding on a build. I like fast builds where I roll around a lot and Dodge attacks. My first run I dual wielded rapiers (Ricards rapier has sick moveset) then in my second run I dual wielded great lances (here comes the hurt train!) I want something different, but I don't want to be a tank with a shield. Any suggestions? Thanks reddit!
10433	Yes they are.	Savage
10434	Ok	Sorry the sarcasm was lost on you. All I was saying is that it's interesting how 2 golfers can have identical handicaps but still be vastly different skill wise.
10435	Well... then you disagree with pretty much all of neuroscience.	I refuse to believe that they believe that animals have sentience. That is so so so stupid. No human can actually believe that I will, however, except that they believe animals have intillegence.
10436	Or if there's a pond nearby he can call the EPA for discharging lead under the Clean Water Act.	If you are not getting any traction on the local level from law enforcement, perhaps reach out to the ATF.
10437	That's just because those ivory tower liberals gravitated towards obscure religions that nobody around them knew about to seem more intelligent.	The Quran actually had a much higher reputation in the West during the 18th and 19th centuries. Thanks radical Islam.
10438	Shoot it.	I would't know what to do
10439	Doug Martin OR Dion Lewis	What would you need to give up ? Let's try another way of gauging trade values. One person, post a player.

For example: Odell Beckham Jr. Randall Cobb and TJ Yeldon Please keep it to 1:1 or 1:2 trades.

10445	It's just like what Charles keeps saying: you live by the three you die by the three.	In NBA history, only 9 teams have shot at least 40% from three in a single season. The 1995-96 Washington Bullets are the only team on this list with a losing record.
10446	TIL I made Mother 3 harder than it it needed to be.	I heard changing frame skip to 0 can help. I dont listen to a beat, i double tap the button until one of the music notes pop up, then i see where it begins, then i wait for it to get there and tap again for combos. I reached 15 combo on a phone emulator and reach a minimum of 5 without sound.

10461	DD is a franchise player, would be an equal trade.	I want 1 Kucherov please. Him and Chucky could do thangs.
10462	They like to ignore "necessary force" and use "maximum force I can get away with", and act like there's no difference.	I don't think police culture can reform themselves from within. They've convinced themselves that any use of force is good if there's even the slightest risk of the least injury to themselves. They've magnified the danger all out of proportion to reality. Only when there's consequences for their casual violence will there be reform.

10469	I've never done quarter stitches, what's so annoying about them?	Finally got around to framing this stitching for my daughter. The quarter stitches in the tree and on the fairy were nightmarish.
10470	I gotta give you props on the background	Colored panel from chapter 71
10471	They're all very much in the normal American weight range.	That was the only thing that struck me in the video - not that they were dancing or that they were redheads. They're all overweight. Not one person out of six (excluding the shop owner/black guy) was a normal weight range.

10475	Probably no team in CN would approach him cuz he demonstrated the past split he's probably the worst jungler in LPL...and there's plenty of jungle talent in LSPL as well	At this point I'd just wish he can retire or find another team and get rid of all the shitstorm going on with the shitty OMG team management/all the internal conflicts. Good luck to him.
10476	I'm awake!	If anybody thinks Bernie has even a remote chance of being elected you are politically naive... while you may think his views are awesome... at the end of the day he is an admitted socialist.. If you dont understand socialism then please see... Russia, Cuba, venezuela and every other place that espouses socialism ...u would probably love to visit cuz you think its cool but after about 5 minutes that novelty would wear off real quick....Capitalism thats what made America great... not that crony capitalism shit we have.. Im talking real capitalism.. the kind that lets banks fail when theyve made bad bets...u ppl are brainwashed if you love bernie.... Santa claus doesnt exist ... nothing is really free and hard work and wealth isnt the enemy... Socialism is the enemy and its had its boot on the necks of the poor for decades... wake up!

10480	But but but he totally knew what he was doing and must be punished!	The article makes a good point. His family convinced him to come home. The next kid in his shoes won't come home bc then he goes to prison. His options then are terrorism or prison. That isn't a good situation to be in.
10481	Only 3 marathons a year?	Nice. Reminds me of my dad, who upped his mileage when he retired and inadvertently lost weight. He didn't like to travel, though, so he kept doing the same three local marathons every year.

10487	Because busy == dangerous, duh!	I've tried to drill down into the data sources here and all I find is that these are the busiest intersections. I see no indication of why they are the most dangerous.
10488	Studies on raw meat (sterilized/clean of course) would be very useful for this subject.	Yes, the article refers to meats that have gone through processing. For example, going by this article's statements, bacon is processed, while a steak is ~~not processed~~ "probably carcinogenic." It still comes down to how you cook the meat (overcooking is bad), and where you get the meat from (local butcher is preferred over premade store-bought).
10489	surely...because if there is something Israel likes is to have a new crazier enemy...	That's funny 9/10 Israelis say the same thing.
10490	And all women want children, and the brunt of pain, discomfort, and work of carrying, birthing, and raising children aren't typically all on the woman, especially in ass-backwards red pillers' worlds.	Because only women want children.
10491	The right to finance foreign wars and not feel any consequence as nasty as savages flooding into your country club during tea time.	So... can you point me at exactly which human right was infringed here? Cause I don't see that.
10492	Hi Daniel :)	Zero Escape: 999 Rap
10493	Yeah please buff Fizz	Why Fizz Q does no dmg if it doesnt hit but Wukong E still does Its just stupid
10494	He has no mouth, can't really taste anything.	"I have never tasted death"
10495	Ok	Installed one more radiator in the case.
10496	You were born in the 80's and act this immature?	They didn't have Plan B in the '80s, she tried a coat hanger, GOD READ THE ENTIRE THREAD
10497	Must be nice to have good genetics.	I guess my wife is doing it wrong. She runs 2 businesses, she is a mom and attends most school functions and eats a cupcake now and then. And she's not fat.
10498	Because black people can't be racist, and if they say stuff like that, it's internalized racism and they're victims.	He literally made sweeping racist remarks. If he is black, then I feel sorry for him.
10499	wtf no DMM	99 range, 85 slayer &amp; jad pet on my zerker
10500	Fuck her right in the pussy	My girlfriend
10501	I'd like that (;	Maybe after this thread dies down. Or I could whisper some to you later when I'm not busy.
10502	Holy shit guys this is creepy as fuck	A local man from the 1950's who dressed as an alien to scare people by running across the road.
10503	And why is LO Calc bad?	One more Mac user is nearing the freedom dimension. Unfortunately, I am bound to using Microsoft Office until I defend my doctoral thesis. I chose Apple as the lesser of two evils to run Office and for their great battery life (this was right when Ultrabooks came out). Yesterday, I installed the beta version of El Crapitan (the r is not a typo). I fully understand that it's a beta and that there will likely be problems. Having said that, Chrome was the only browser that I could use for most of the morning, which is my favorite, but I use multiple browsers because I have a mild case of OCD. I couldn't take it anymore, so I restarted and booted into my Arch partition. I installed a Windows VM in Arch so that I didn't have to pull my non-existent hair out while using open source office suites that have horrible spreadsheet implementation. There is one bright side to this trouble though. I am getting closer to the freedom dimension. When I get there, I am going to go out and buy a maroon collared shirt to celebrate.
10504	Oh, so you're a raw denim snob huh?	Honestly, I just wasn't sure if they were what I thought they were. I also don't generally strike up conversations with people about raws unless they're especially notable (like the dude I met in a pet store wearing some S710XXs).
10505	It's not as if "776" was written on it in f*cking red letters, you know.	"Geneology of the Holy War" then it shows a picture of thracia's box art.
10506	Don't you have "next release" posts to make or something?	thats a popular opinion actually
10507	Yeah, worked for nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, too!	Arrest the rioters, problem solved.
10508	But hes a pedo so they don't count	RandomRambo is the highest I've seen with 1874 wins on MM
10509	Duh, it's because whites are the majority and therefor cannot be oppressed!	For the last time, you are not an oppressed minority!
10510	Having a hard time figuring out if you really like this stuff or if your comments =	that seems like it could work. people say that pop punk is pizza, but i think emo could be pasta. same themes just softer and more expressive. thank you.
10511	He isn't even our QB, russell wilson is dummy...	This is why I thought we probably weren't making it back to the Super Bowl this season (even before games were played). Luck is an important factor and we were very lucky last season... Used it all up, lol.
10512	because we still need to see what beckerman and zusi can offer	This was pretty much expected. But I'd be surprised if he's called up before the January camp.
10513	I'm glad I have access to VLSC in case this is true	Windows 10 needs to be repurchased for hardware change?
10514	How dare we work with China?	Britain 'sucking up' to China is a national humiliation, says PM's former adviser
10515	They have a good work ethic is all.	Why do people who obviously have a decent grasp of English (since 30mins into the game after screaming in spanish they will start to whine in English about how everyone lost the game for them) want to ONLY speak Spanish when 3-4 people on their team speak English and they are on the US servers? I just don't get the behavior of South Americans on Dota at all, it's like they make it their job to give everyone the worst experience possible.
10516	I suspected it near the end of the second movie.	Honest question: how did no one suspect that Darth Vader was Luke's father when these movies were being released? It's established in the first movie that Obi Wan trained Luke's father, AND he trained Darth Vader? Those are the only two apprentices that Obi Wan mentions he had, so wouldn't a smart movie-goer see that coming or at least suspect it? Maybe I'm just used to having it spoiled, I don't know.
10517	It's surprising that they didn't make turrets a rebel token	I agree. Allowing imperials to use rebel turrets is a big mistake.
10518	Flames	Lil Wayne - Back to Back Remix Snippet
10519	You should be working more hours in your cubicle instead of doing these foolish things!	I know you're joking, but in my opinion, there's no such thing as too much free time. Besides, I do these on my lunch break at work, and this particular challenge only took 15 minutes. No excuses.
10520	Yarne and Nah are both really bad, Robin is better with Cordelia or maybe Lissa.	The subhumans (Yarne and Nah) don't get very good things from their mother IIRC, so they're options.
10521	In his Cliff getup	Nah, Blake and DeAndre, CP3 would be a perfect fit for their boss.
10522	4/5 stars... They would have got 5/5 if they fixed that unfixable bug though amirite	You guys are fucking great You guys have an awesome app, and you do a great job of trying to help anybody with an issue. Keep it up
10523	Good thing the Austin American Statesmen blogs about regional schools.	Oh, they forgot about Texas State. Silly guys.
10524	Yea, king is clearly a better writer than Pynchon.	Stephen King said something along the lines of overly descriptive language being more like a technical manual than a novel. How much detail do you NEED in order to picture a scene? Pynchon is typical of needlessly weighty language. A good storyteller, but not known for clear use of language to convey a point.
10525	But we cant punish them, that would be against their human rights.	Because reasons. Same reasons the police "can't do anything about it". Such a fucking joke. This is only a couple hundred, what are you lot going to do when they're there by the thousands and tens of thousands? Because they're going to keep coming and coming and coming. There is literally no incentive for them to not at least try. Especially if there are no repercussions once you make it.
10526	I bet you're sleeping with the professor to get those grades because AWALT.	Welp. This one has fulfilled my red pill quotient for the day. Off to be a Harpie getting top grades in my anatomy class!
10527	what happened on that day?	this will probably endup being another Dec 21, 2012.
10528	Yea the one in the Anonymous mask.	The dirty, masked weeaboo that torched the car last episode.
10529	Wait, you can't use a 55 gallon barrel of lube?	I was looking for an excuse to buy something, yet at the end of the day I'm buying nothing.
10530	I guess they're afraid she'll grow up to be a contributing member of society.	A nine-year-old Calgary girl, suffering from severe seizures, will not have her medical marijuana prescription renewed despite its ability to stop her having 30+ seizures per day
10531	Where were you between 11.30 and 11.45 this morning?	we didn't do it
10532	But if I don't birth them at home the Doctors could give them vaccines!	In my late 20s and see a LOT of new mothers my age worrying about every little thing their kid does. They worry that their kids will turn out 'bad' (lack of better word) so they become obsessive and believe every single choice made during childhood will somehow disrupt the flow of the child's life. You don't need to give birth at home...will that REALLY matter to the overall quality of your child's life or alter their personality in some way? Will completely demonizing technology and games because you believe the overhyped characterization of modern kids as techno zombies make them smarter than the kids allowed to go on an iPad for an hour a day? Just chill and love your kids and teach them right and keep them healthy. Don't teach them to be awkward or neurotic
10533	Gets hard countered by mass dispel, literally unplayable	I disagree. You're underestimating the strength of drawing cards. Light's Justice isn't even worth a whole mana. It could cost 0 and still be almost unplayable. On the other hand, drawing three random cards (even though they have the chance of being bad) is definitely worth something. Ball of Spiders is essentially 3/3 worth of stats that draws you three cards. Compare that with something like Nourish, for example. Yes, the cards you draw have the chance of being bad, but Nourish doesn't come with three bodies. Six mana may be slightly too much, but anything less than five mana is pushing the card, in my opinion.
10534	Nice save!	OMG! Nice shot!
10535	I'd say women in particular	I'd say most elderly people in particular.
10536	The important part is how Cristiano reacted after the goal.	Benzema goal vs Manchester City (1-0)
10537	Most definitely, have to keep hydrated and all that jazz	Do you drink kerosene?
10538	Because it's just those dumb welfare people that need to be sterilized	But ironically love pictures of special needs people
10539	If that's their motivation, then the flying spaghettimonster says hi!	That's basically it. But I think it's funny that they clearly think they're so smart for thinking of it and making a mockery of religion.
10540	I don't know... they're usually so careful when it comes to transporting massive amounts of oil.	Who gives a shit? The danger to America is having a pipeline of tar sands oil going across thousands of miles of basically pristine land that could either rupture from shoddy construction or more nefarious causes like domestic terrorism.
10541	Wow, I haven't seen this reposted 3 times a week since it came out over a year ago.	Undercover Cop Tricks Autistic Student into Selling Him Weed (2014) - "VICE short piece on CA police entrapment of special needs students"
10542	In fact, it would be quite comical.	But since you're only a man, if you get raped it won't be such a big impact for them...
10543	Accused, Alleged, Charged, Convicted... who cares what any of those words mean these days?	*Former Teacher Accused of Having Sex with 13-Year-Old Student* Not *charged*...
10544	Then you must either be under 18 or not in the US if you're allowed on reddit	Never have I ever voted for a Democrat.
10545	You forgot the	Cod is at least 3x as good. No stupid spray pattern, can aim down sights, better weapons and graphics. There's a reason it costs 3x as much.
10546	It's custodial engineer you jerk.	"Scienetists of reddit, can you explain me quantum physics?" "I'm a janitor, but..." (ps no offense to janitors)
10547	Yes	Sarcasm?
10548	That was quite the intelligent response.	Have you ever watched American Idol?
10549	Cause going 72 instead of the speed limit of 65 gets me there much faster.	U.S drivers who hog the left lane, why do you do it?
10550	See this right here is why NC wins all the alerts!	Funny, because when I go from my VS to my NC character I get exactly the same feeling. The NC weapons are just devastating. Real power and accuracy.
10551	Broncos camp opened.	COLORADO SELLS $34 MILLION IN MARIJUANA IN ONE MONTH: $3.4 MILLION GOES TO SCHOOLS, AND CRIME DOWN 15%
10552	Yeah, so many people are attacking Ethiopia and northern Africa	because they are happy attacking all the countries making the people refugees
10553	Well, she has to be by his side to help him protect the sanctity of marriage.	Anna Duggar will never leave her cheating anti-LGBT activist husband
10554	Sign your profile	If I had a few to give away, what would you do for it? Purely hypothetical ;)
10555	You forgot the	it's considered good sportsmanship to sit and watch your own replays. It shows you have an appreciation for the game. Also celebrations are very important the longer you can celebrate for is telling the opponent how honoured you are to score against him. By skipping replays you are acting like a preteen jerk who thinks nothing of the goals and 'deserves' to beat your opponent.
10556	and the amazing arc has definitely nothing to do with this.	To be fair, the FV304's accuracy is mostly derived from the fact that it has to shoot from short range, not the stats of the gun.
10557	Further increasing the chances of making 3rd place then.	I just don't even care anymore. Ever match from now on I'll be lawn mowing.
10558	he probably is getright and flusha together	69bomb (seems legit)..
10559	yeah that's worked really well last two quarters	buy apple calls dated after earnings
10560	forgot the	No, if I coldn't save them all, then I wouldn't feel obliged to try and save even one. Children only have value if you have the whole set.
10561	don't be so judgmental...	face tattoo
10562	Well, I mean, what else are you going to do once you've read all the books and heard all the radio-borne propaganda?	Well if i was it hiding from the Nazis, i'd be jilling it too
10563	If Mike Tyson understood boxing he would have seen how good of a fight it was.	Man he's just a casual
10564	Yep, Oz Superturismos!	Nice, what wheels are those? OZ?
10565	Filthy core picker detected	Ya know what would be nice? If the next hero was something other than a support.
10566	How DARE you be a woman of breeding age who doesn't want a gaggle of little darlings to devote your life to!	Double standards are the worst. I'm sitting in the break room at work with two others. There's me (21), a guy (27), and a woman (50s). Guy says he wants to travel somewhere at least once a year for the rest of his life. He wants to do that instead of kids. I'm thinking, "Awesome! Someone like me." I get really excited, especially when the woman says, "Good for you! Children are overrated." I perk up and say I want to travel as well. Kids aren't for me. This fucking woman... She says, "But you're so young! You'll change your mind soon enough." Wait. You just said kids are overrated. How come, in your mind, it's okay for this guy (who is close to my age) to not want kids, but I *must* want kids? That's so stupid! I just... arghghgh...
10567	Him and Ray Allen are actually 2 of the 5 guys burgers	Wall still has a hot chocolate before games. Dunno how many or from where though. He always talks about how he hasn't had hamburgers in years, which I've always interpreted as him throwing us off the scent off of an embarrassing, uncontrollable burger addiction.
10568	Looks like an iLimb.	Anyone know wtf is going on here, is she controlling that hand with her brain?
10569	well, you are.	You're all gonna die
10570	what a shitlord	I like that cooper followed her answer with "sure, whatever, but what about changes that matter, you know, policy changes" basically.
10571	Now that's an awesome fish tank	Decided to play Mario Kart in the House
10572	They love the coco	They're crazy in the coconut.
10573	I was so confused in 76 on how I could have missed, and never heard of episodes 1 to 3 of such an epic movie.	I was 10 and I spent the rest of the day desperately trying to find out where I could find the first 3 episodes. This was before the internet.
10574	*Trve* metal fans don't listen to anything past ...And Justice For all.	Metallica has had elitists since the mid-80's. This is nothing new.
10575	Ya me too, I also never leave.	I don't know about you, but DTES is the only place I go to when it's time to shoot mushrooms.
10576	Ugh I thought this Chris Pratt ball coddling was done.	A couple of people
10577	=SUM(up)	That pretty much sums up.
10578	Yep.	I know the type you speak of. The "die cis scum" folks that see transphobic microaggressions in every single thing.
10579	Well CT produced the leagues only mass murderer so I guess we can let them walk.	Of course fucking Connecticut doesn't side with the rest of New England.
10580	Yeah, because people have no motivation to do something productive with there lives	Actually it's quite smart. Get everyone living off the government. Then the people need that Government. You either have a single point of failure which will be detrimental to society or may somehow be used to put the people in to a type of slavery. Either way, money just doesn't come out of thin air unless they're going to drive the currency to the ground.
10581	on weekdays, the bellagio breakfast buffet is very good... and sub $15.	Any good breakfast places near the Aria?
10582	like is it a joke or isn't it make up your mind yo	I hate the 'haha'. What is that about? "Gonna write something creepy but typing haha will completely disarm her!'
10583	I was going to say...better not be lesser seen in general, considering X-23 took up the Wolverine helm and Marvel looooooves Wolverine... I could get behind some Lady Deathstrike silver nail polish.	Oh, there is a planned duo for all of those! I have them written in a notebook. The Riddler: lips- blue leaning violet. Eyes- black with extremely strong lime green shift Grundy: lips- grey blue. Wide-ranging corpsy green/grey. If I had the time, money, and resources, it would be quite extensive! I also want to make a Lesser Seen Marvel collection- Gambit, Rogue, Raven, X-23, Shiklah, etc. Characters that people like, but that you very rarely see in fandom created things.
10584	It's a touchy subject.	Some people were being downvoted simply for answering questions.
10585	Every time someone claims to be an expert you have to read the last line first.	I skipped to the bottom of this post to see if I was gonna be trolled. It seems sound enough. Nice post.
10586	Priorities, am I right guys?	I see his right hand touching the base before his face touches the butt.
10587	Yup, 9/11 was a scam and no muslims have ever hurt anyone anywhere in the world!	It is sad to see Reddit sink into tabloid bullshit to push the hate for muslims.
10588	When you're not 14 years old anymore and you actually have people to take care of and debt to manage you'll understand.	Keep on justifying shitty decisions, I'm sure that will work out for you in life
10589	no of course not, Riot need to do absolutely everything they can to make NA an internationally competitive region by Destroying Korea's streaming system and then blatantly giving EU less competitive games, because NA absolutely *has* to be the best region	Anybody else agree that both the NA and EU LCS should have the same format?
10590	Two easily, the cold damage will provide way more than the extra dex.	Not sure which Hellfire Amulet to use for U6. Amulet 1: 999 Dex, 6% CDR, 80% CHD (being rerolled). Beacon of Ytar passive. Amulet 2: 702 Dex, 15% Cold, 80% CHD (being rerolled). Harmony passive. I realise that the optimal stats are Dex, Cold %, CHD, but given that the first amulet is ancient and has close to 300 extra Dex would it end up being better? The CHD is going to be rerolled as high as possible eventually on either amulet, so that part's not really important.

10594	No it's because they are white.	I like how a $6500 Segway makes them "rich" while people in poor neighborhoods regularly put $5000 rims and paint jobs on their hoopty ass cars. Matter of perspective and whats important to you.
10595	Exactly.	"Obama used to go to gay bath houses!" Ok. So? "Obama is really Muslim!" And?
10596	it's not your fans revving up because it's processor intense?	Strange noise while copying files in Mint 17.3 Rosa I don't know if this is a feature or something in Rosa since I didn't have this noise in 17.2. Even if it's just a feature, it sounds like a crappy CD drive from 2002 and I want to get rid of it. It is most prevalent when copying or moving huge files and disturbs / distracts me when I am doing something. Help...

10610	Howdy, H.W.	My sons teacher incentivizes the kids for participation/helpful behaviour in the class. She used blank slips of paper, and hands them to the kids to write their names on and put them in the ballot box. My son realized there were no special marking on the ballots and it was just standard lined paper so he started submitted his name many times a day. My son stuffed the weekly ballot box for classroom prizes from the teacher for two or three months. Once she caught on to it, the teacher was upset about his dishonesty. I was impressed that a 6 year old outsmarted a 45 year old for weeks on end.

10619	Or the German army could have reasonned that preserving their troops to fight the Soviet was more important than their pride, but Hitler was really mad and utterred that Warsaw should be rased.	The whole idea behind the uprising was to control Warsaw before the arrival of the Soviets. Having the Red Army stay on the other side of the river was exactly what was required for it to (potentially) succeed. No surprise it stayed there when everything inevitably went to shit. Sad, sad time.
10620	but it comes with the os	I wouldnt exactly describe solitaire as an OS.
10621	Maybe terrorist attacks should happen more often...	An absolutely quiet day in New York City, with all commerce stopped, and everyone being slow and kind to each other. It was September 12th, 2001. There was no subway service, no air traffic, no cell phone use (we were told to keep them free for emergency lines). Stores were closed and no one went to work. It was a stunningly beautiful day, 70oF and not a cloud in the sky. We all had nothing to do but take walks. We would pass each other, total strangers, make eye contact, give a small smile and nod, and then move on. The whole city became like a very small town on a Sunday. It was so quiet.

My household had multiple members with multiple tvs. Good job sling. Guess I'll go back to stealing the content. You people just don't get it do you.
10639	No HDR+, just HDR.	If you have a Moto X Style/Pure, could you download Google Camera from the Play Store and quickly check if it has HDR+? It should be on the options below the viewfinder. Thanks.
10640	Truth be told I often wondered how that fight would go when Anderson had the belt and was the world beater we knew him to be at one point, kinda felt like it was an inevitable matchup	While we're at it, do Anderson Silva vs Bisping.

After overhead they could easily clear 35-50 an hour if they manage their spending and stay in a low rent area. I can't speak specifically for HVAC, but tradesmen could easily out earn a lit major.
10678	So what you're saying is kick out the brown people	Japan has a healthy middle class and a homogenous populace. These are luxuries the US doesn't have.
10679	Why wasn't he taken out of the game?	Seahawks' Coleman's lawyers suggest he fell asleep at the wheel and suffered a concussion from the accident which is why he walked away, likely due to being totally disoriented. They guarantee he was in no way impaired and believe all tests will be negative.

10697	Why have common sense and restraint when internet reviewers and rottentomatoes can tell you what you should and shouldn't like instead of thinking for yourself.	Because it was pretty clearly being set up this way. Or because it's stupid to complain about the lack of fallout from the event when the movie that logically might depict that fallout hasn't been released. There are a number of ways in which common sense and an ounce of restraint would make someone decide to hold back on that specific complaint.

I understand most people would want some time or to decide...but maybe...and I'm saying just maybe at some point in their relationship he's figured out what would make his wife happy. /endrant

10710	Even more proof reality has a right wing bias	Maybe I spend too much time on this sub, but a carbon tax doesn't seem left wing; it seems like the right wing, free markets approach to dealing with a problem that we're already applying left wing solutions (outright regulation) to.

10712	But I lost to face hunter and I'm salty about it!	And because they are full of anti-Aggro, they win against Aggro. Just look at the Control Warrior. He has so easy time beating all those Face Hunters. I don't remember my last CW game I lost against Face hunter. Let's take Control Priest. Throw in two Deathlords into your deck and your win percentage against Aggro becomes so good. Even Handlock isn't terrible against Aggro. If he draws into Molten Giants &amp; Sunfury/Argus it's almost auto-win. And even if not, he can often stabilize before turn 9 where he heals with Jaraxxus. People are overestimating Aggro decks. Yes it's obvious that they can win. Especially since their skill floor is much lower than that of Control decks. If you put someone who is, let's say "pretty bad" at this game behind Handlock and you put another guy behind the Face Hunter, guess who's gonna have a bigger chance. But if two good players play those decks, those who actually have a lot of experience in the matchup and know what to do, the result is not that easy to predict. So no, Aggro decks don't dominate the meta. Maybe low ranked ladder, but that's about it. When you play in high Legend you actually face slower decks much often than hyper-Aggro ones. In this expansion we're getting a lot of "Anti-Aggro tools" and the Aggro decks don't actually get much. Is it good? Well, I don't mind, but I don't think it was really needed. Everyone is saying "we need to slow the meta down!" while the meta isn't really fast. In the low ranked ladder it's fast because the faster you win - the faster you climb, plus you can play Aggro decks more on an autopilot. It has nothing to do with them being stronger.
10713	Yes	No

10716	Back in myyyy day we boiled our eggs on the sidewalk!	I used to repair these at the manufacturer repair facility. What model is it? If it's the one I think it is, these were notorious for getting past the boiling point of water and not shutting off. AMDs were terrible in these since the Intel versions never had the heating issues that the AMDs had. The manufacturer always put the shitty paste on them, but when I had to repair these, I always put Arctic Silver on them. However, that still didn't fix the heating issues and after replacing the CPU, heatsink, and MB, they still had heating issues.

Do you think it's time to move on? I know we gave him that contract extension a few years back, But if trading him and Sully and a pick means we get a star in return (Butler Sign and Trade, Cousins, etc.) I say pull the trigger.

10729	Colluding with the Saudis no doubt.	Clearly this is the NDP's fault.
10730	Well yeah, but dude have you ever BEEN on the L90?	Part of the problem is that since public transport is government subsidised (which isn't a bad thing, like all gov.t programs there are downsides) people are willing to use it more than it's cost. So if someone is choosing between 2 near identical apartments, the difference is that one is $40 a week more in rent (lets assume you value your time on public transport as -$20/hour, so you'd be happy to pay $20 to save one hour on the bus/train), and you save $19 a week in fares by living closer, and living closer saves an hour each day. You're probably going to choose to live further away because you're $1 a week better off. However since public transport is heavily subsidised living further away costs the government another $20 a week, so you have a non-ideal situation that arises because a certain economic activity (transport) is subsidised. One possible solution is vary the way that we pay for transport, if we had a system that more accuretly reflected the cost you placed on the system (such as having all forms of transport priced based on things like "peak v. off peak") then the market would correct and people would take the better option. This would lead to people living in denser areas. But that's full of problems. Another way, and IMO the best way, is to open up areas that have minimal transport footprint (ie. inner city areas, land near universities likely to be inhabited by students) for denser development. IMO as long as it's reasonable (eg. sufficient plumbing) anywhere within 10 minutes walk of a university should be zoned for 4 story apartments. Anywhere within 5 minutes walk of a train station should be zoned for apartments as well. But in the end sometimes the solution is to not have a solution, at some point the governnment needs to say to places like this "if you want to work in the city, move". At some point the cost of getting people from the northern beaches into the city is not worth it, *THE GOVERNMENT MUST BALANCE NEEDS AND USE IT'S LIMITED FUNDS IN THE MOST RESPONSIBLE WAY POSSIBLE, OFTEN THIS INVOLVES IGNORING ONE STAKEHOLDER TO HELP OTHERS*.

The surface is fairly expensive, about 400,000 dollars to resurface it and it just got done for the first time since the olympics I think. So they don't want a lot of people on it. Also it means no one with improper footwear will be on the track.

A woman has the choice to have a child when she becomes pregnant. A man does not. That is a huge advantage.

10786	np	Thank you for the link, it gave me alot to think about regarding his views on Paul Ryan and the Republican budget. I'll read more on this topic tonight.
10787	It takes 2 seconds or less to clean, not exactly a hardship to endure.	Circumcised dude here. I'm glad it happened, honestly, because it's one less thing to have to clean AND I last longer since I'm missing a fuckton of sensation. It should still be a choice allowed for each person once they're older, but I don't think it is without its benefits, no matter how small or subjective they may be.
10788	Utopian policies always work out so well.	I disagree, everyone is entitled to those things and it should be the number one goal of any country to ensure its citizens achieve happiness and a good life.
10789	American store of fuel, food and drinks.	What's Wawa?
10790	Mark me down as disagreeing, and wait for more opinions.	The question was if other people agreed with my conclusion though...
10791	I more than likely will in a month or so	Do it again!
10792	Too late	Yes, but do you really want Faygo? You'll become the juggalo capital of the world.
10793	Keep backing up.	Women getting physically close to me when talking to them? Does it mean anything? Or what about if they break the touch barrier? For context, just having small talk. Nothing flirty. Maybe just a few jokes. By getting close to me, i mean closer than arms length maybe half an arm or closer, if that makes sense.
10794	oh yeah that makes it okay that he got away with it.	It was over a year ago. I don't think he's done it since.
10795	Yeah, silly plebs, why are you afraid of a free ignite that never goes on cool down, and is always active.	And yet, Darius's potential to carry is miles away from the potential Kassadin had. People are just way to afraid of Darius and his passive imo.
10796	It was fair, they had an 8th prestige at the start.	That matchmaking tho
10797	I think that Monstrata and Bearizm should collab for the ultimate PP map, like the Maniera of standard, to make every top 100 DT player's PP go up by 1000.	Ummm, almost every Monstrata's map? And Tatoe for sure
10798	Man, the internet, eh?	Man, Toronto, eh? Totally not full of miserable people who take any opportunity to bitch about things.
10799	Yeah, I remember hearing about that a couple days after I got a call from my Sysco rep telling me I was going to have to come get 4 cases of chicken that they had forgotten off of my truck; no more hot drops...	Sysco Fined Millions for Food Safety Violations
10800	funny!	LOL silver noob

10807	Q.E.D.	So because the Earth spins at a high speed, planes have to exceed the spinning Earth to go to point A to point B? By that logic when I jump I should be propelled miles away from where I jumped.
10808	Fashionable hooey.	Unfortunately clan tartans don't go back further than the 1800s. They were pretty much made up by one company that was trying to sell them to the various clans, claiming that they had done research into the various histories. It was all a line of hooey.
10809	Think they had a couple of pops together after the ceremony?	This couple just had my dream wedding.
10810	Cause no one has ever been sad like me and dammit they need to know it.	Why are we trying to turn loss into a competition here?

10812	It's almost like you are saying that the Book of Mormon is at odds with reality.	It's not all on church leaders. There is nowhere *to* publish such studies. No self-respecting non-Mormon journal would take an article like that. "Hebrew Bible and Ancient Israel" is an actual scholarly field, with non-Mormon professors and graduate programs and journals and all. "Book of Mormon and Ancient Israel/America" is not.

10828	There are Legacy GPs and SeaTac in November is not being run by SCG.	Second best thing: Wouldn't mind a premiere event that was just legacy. Not run by the business that is star city.
10829	Thanks for helping out someone new to the game.	Heart or Flower. New game mode
10830	I agree, all 3 lanes should be seperated by big walls and the junglers shouldn't be able to leave their own jungle.	The game is way too balanced around the competitive aspect of it.
10831	Can I like skill with these?	Beast of burdens are great since they hold extra items seperate from your inventory, but you can grab from them whenever need be. Bull Ants can hold up to 9 items Spirit Terrorbird -12 items War Tortoise - 18 items Pack Yak - 30 items

10835	Yeah OP is being so inconsiderate right now...	Maybe he had a friend nicknamed City who passed recently.
10836	Let's make it a 18+ game.	Or Riots trend of not wanting children who play the game being forced to play with AsslickKing, NubThroatFucker, whitepeoplerule and killalljews as his team mates.Or any variation of those names with clever use of numbers because the idiot with the name is so cool
10837	People like those are surely going to be grateful to Germany!	Exactly. She sold her car for 6000 Euros. 4000 went to smugglers to get her and her son through Europe, and the other 2000 were spent on food. She now has around 200 Euros and the dream of getting a rent free house and 650 euros.
10838	They should just raise the minimum wage to 100 Trillion kwacha per hour.	Except people get paid in money. Which has decreasing value. And your salary doesn't adjust to inflation, usually. So... yeah, that only works if you have substantial capital and see the inflation coming (or act as soon as you see it starting).
10839	It's time to get the reddit army on this	Yeah, I'm in the same boat, have played every Halo co-op with the same friend, unfortunately there's no split-screen either.
10840	Who could have possibly known that a show aimed at teens wouldn't sell children's toys?	They didn't sell enough toys. Yep, that's the reason.
10841	And if she reaches her goal of $1,000,000 she can get awareness to all women on Earth and women will care about men as people!	I think she was fairly clear from the start that $97,000 was the minimum amount she needed to reach to make the film. And apparently, that was including cutting her staff's pay in half and taking on much of the cost herself. And the concept of "stretch goals" is not at all uncommon with Internet crowd-funded projects like this.
10842	It has those crappy knock off handles that 90% of CCC's have, so DEFINITELY real.	How do you tell if a Benchmade balisong is real/fake?
10843	Sounds like a crushing amount of government regulation that's only going to drive business away.	In my country it's mandatory to state (at least) the minimium wage for the job. It's very convenient!
10844	How are you not banned yet?	Same thing.
10845	With your grasp of the English language and ability to ask a logical question; you are completely hopeless as a journalist.	Anyone can be a journalist nowadays and they can be one throught the avenue of the internet. do you think their are still jobs for us ( who really studied the course), after we graduate in a traditional way?
10846	Honeycomb or GTFO!	Android 4.0 (and no later) was the best Android for tablets.
10847	Gotta love injection wells!	U.S. Oil Hub in Oklahoma on Alert as National Security Officials Warn of Potential for Damaging Earthquakes
10848	Hey man you're like, toxic and entitled the grumps are my friends	So you think an editor, who's job is to make sure the technical aspects of a production are up to par, should keep his job after allowing multiple videos to go out with unsynced or messed up audio, messes up the release schedule, forgets to put titles on videos and forgets putting in descriptions? Even not putting in seizure warnings after being asked? You really think he's earned his job after making rookie, careless mistakes after another? It would be excusable if he was doing great unnecessary edits like Barry would do, but that RARELY happens (Yeah, he put the end slate in early yesterday as a joke, but what skill does it take to put a pre made border up?). He should of been fired awhile ago.
10849	Excellent refutation of the point made.	You know that's a cover of a German song, right? That's another example of the Hollandcentrism by Hollandic artists.
10850	8274 Thanks OP.	Steam Cash Giveaway! Pick number between 1-10,000
10851	Time for another intense game of Bransa AryTheon	It's always sunny in Winterfell.
10852	"win" is the team with the higher score	Haven't gotten anything back on bets i win.
10853	Only teams on the coast	You clearly didn't think this through, you know there has to be a division somewhere right? What do you suppose they do.
10854	No, you must hate 343, that's how this subreddit works	I might be alone in this but I'm totally okay with this. I'm always the sort to play the Mark V armor anyway
10855	I forgot how popular Sonos was	Because Xbox Music has pretty poor applications on other platforms and lacks Sonos integration which makes it a no go for many. Then add the fact that it has weak social features and MS refuses to advertise for it then you understand why people would pick Spotify over it. Xbox Music is cool if you are in the MS ecosystem fully which many are not.
10856	No, because any joke at the expense of women is sexist	Isn't that the joke?
10857	Go home whitey.	A bunch of whiners with a superiority complex and an inferiority complex at the same time. They also flame everybody who isn't Asian-American. The other day I saw a thread saying that Asian men are not shorter on average and that's just a myth. i said that yes, indeed, the height average in northern China is rather high, but that in the south they are shorter... I got a few upvotes because what I said was factually correct and helped the discussion. Then I said that I know it because I live in China, and even though I'm a 6-foot white guy, many locals tower me. Immediately all my posts got retroactively downvoted, I got called a "sexpat" and told to GTFO. Racist shitheads.
10858	Yeah, I'm sure that feels wonderful.	You can hold someone's head and force them to perform oral sex, even if they are passed out, asleep, etc.
10859	I'm sure you could direct us to some Marxist pamphlets so we can "educate" ourselves.	Lol the NYT. A great source of propaganda. No wonder you are all so ignorant on this crisis.
10860	GE2 as soon as MH4U for Wii U is launched in order to "show off graphic superiority".	Can we please just get less repetitive game play that doesn't take well over an hour to complete one late game mission? Also, God Eater 2 NA when?
10861	But how will he do against a wrestler?	CHOO CHOO
10862	Don't mean to burst your proverbial bubble, but he doesn't have an Instagram account.	Aww guys Kostas is so sweet! All the best bud!
10863	There's still Lakers fans out there?	Found the cyclone or lakers fan
10864	Yes 'cause this is the first time!	About time they start handling these assholes.
10865	Hey don't you know that they are all drug mules, criminals, and rapists?	Not Mexico because stereotypes
10866	That's just your internalized misogyny sweetheart.	I get outcast from the 'feminists' for doing this..
10867	I wasn't going to get Anna since I didn't want her without Elsa... but I couldn't resist having them both.	For those who just couldn't let it go, Elsa from Frozen is being re released!
10868	Thank you, I got it in, but that brings another question, how is the graphics card supposed to be supported?	That is supposed to go between the motherboard and the case. If you look at the placeholders on your case you removed to put in the video card, you will notice a similar design. There should be a very small gap between the mobo and the case. Do **NOT** force it between the mobo and case if it won't go. I would try to re-seat the motherboard and try again if you are not able to put it in smoothly.
10869	First of all how dare you, evolution is just a theory	There were two of them. They should both be fired. This is one of those things that will cost the taxpayers of the area a bunch of extra money, and the teachers will just think that they are oppressed, and martyrs for their religion.
10870	0/10 bad chairs	My Third CS:GO LAN!
10871	A three way nuke fight between those assholes might solve as many problems as it causes.	Nothing like a nuclear arms race between Sunnis and Shias with Israel in the middle to avoid war
10872	-1 for non-drive side	ITAP of me and my bike
10873	Don't get me started on	Fuck "TIL".
10874	You obviously forgot "Kyle Allen for Heisman"	"Is John Chavis ACTUALLY a good defensive coordinator?" "Is Sumlin really the offensive genius we all thought he was?" "The Pac12 South is CLEARLY better than the SEC West." "Can the SEC even make the playoff this year?" "START KYLER MURRAY" OR: "Is A&amp;M the favorite to win the West?" "Is LSU going to survive without legendary immortal John Chavis?" "Is most of Chavis' power in his mustache?" "Kyler Murray to immediately request transfer, no chance of starting" "Why did we think Muschamp was the better DC hire again?" "The SEC West is absolutely the best division in the history of college football and we should be ashamed for ever doubting them." "Could the SEC get 2 teams in the playoff after all?"
10875	You dropped this:	Dude, totally! This is going to be great.. you're right, we'll make the "third world" like the "first world!" Why the heck didn't anyone think of this before? If it's just as good *there*, they won't need to come *here!* Except as tourists, I guess. Well, let's get at it!
10876	144 fps you pleb	You're talking to PCMR people who think that unless it's 60fps at 4K it's worthless.
10877	Vegan racist confirmed!	I just tried to imagine a group who actively loathes sausages of any kind and realized I would be okay with a hate sub that targeted that group. Not my finest moment, but these anti-sausage bullies must be eradicated.
10878	Only 60fps filthy casual	Graphics mod that Makes TF2 look like a Horror film
10879	Shhhhhhh no one tell him it's not	Grizzy is a cool sounding word is it not? It makes for a neat online pseudonym. It is slang "grinder".
10880	0/10 Missing 'Evolves from' part ^^	I've been painting pokemon card designs onto canvases for my friends. Flareon has been my best one yet
10881	Downvoted because you said "god" without immediately adding "don't real".	There are two ways the theist might approach this. First, if she is motivated to theism by arguments for the existence of God, then she can say that we know God is good because goodness is a necessary attribute of God, as proven by whatever argument she deploys. Second, if she takes theism to be a properly basic belief then she can appeal to her direct experiences of a God that seems good and a general policy of taking ones experiences at face value in the absence of reasons not to. It is possible that I am a brain in a vat being deceived about the nature of my experiences, but that my experiences seem to me to be of physical objects which I directly experience is a reason to believe that there is that sort of external world. Similarly, without a reason to believe otherwise the 'properly basic' theist is warranted in believing that God is how God seems.
10882	Everyone knows hip hop started with Kanye, old man.	I am in my middle 50s, and I like rap music. Millennials find that perplexing. Apparently, there was no hip-hop before Snoop Dogg.
10883	Good, then the money can go towards a real computer	Have this in my school. Everyone gets a MacBook Air free of charge, and when we graduate we have the possibility to buy the laptop at a heavily reduced price. But if I were to say quit school tomorrow (to chase my dream of being a pro gamer, of course) I would have to give it back.
10884	Thanks for the insight	As mentioned - it will really come down to your specific financial circumstances and the business financials of the proposed purchase. Perhaps your broker has ruled out any lender above 14%p.a. because it is simply unaffordable given these factors. The critical thing to remember, especially in commercial lending where the lenders don't have the same duty of care that consumer lenders do (by virtue of commercial lenders not needing to abide by the NCCP Act), is that just because some company/person will lend you money doesn't mean it is a good idea for you to take the loan. The alternative is that you seek equitable funding i.e. someone takes a stake in your business in exchange for cash that they will give you - but the reality is that if you couldn't get approved for a loan and you are not doing something tremendously unique, that this 'investor' will want a huge proportion of your business (and therefore any profits) in exchange for that money.
10885	Free weekly skateboards, fuck yeah!	What I get every week.
10886	Those last ones we call wetbacks... we don't allow their kind in if we can help it	Europeans Asians and Africans with boats also Mexicans without boats
10887	Do explain	You need to work on your reading comprehension, kid.
10888	I'm just glad we at Reddit can take credit for solving the case!	Boston marathon bomber will receive the death penalty (discussion Megathread)
10889	But doesn't any of those people know the patriarchal messages they will internalize simply by playing the game?	All that internalised misogyny
10890	Im sure that was just a mistake, because we all know that Assad is the only evil in this war and this moderates would never kill innocent civilians!	Shell near Damascus school kills teacher, wounds 23 students in government area
10891	Other than purging a good half of them, yeah, he was ok.	pretty sure Stalin gave control the his general's almost immediately, didn't he?
10892	I'm sure we're all terribly reassured that this genius is going to be out there involved in law enforcement and damn confident in himself once he's completed whatever 5 month certification course he's in.	So... was today your first day in school? Just about everything you've said is wrong. Please don't pretend to be an expert and just post paragraphs of bullshit, people are upvoting it and thinking any of it is accurate.
10893	TIL: Poor people can get credit cards.	you can always afford condoms and birth control even if you have to travel great distances to family planning clinics/universities or buy them on credit. The interest on a credit card still beats what a kid will cost you.
10894	YOU AND ME BROTHER!	Milestone reached! 50,000 sea lions! 50,000 in just little over a year and still growing. Congratulations!
10895	In before "hurr durr good riddance Peruvians"	So what happens if someone at a LAN cafe gets IP banned?
10896	I've had Chase Business and Personal cards combine.	If you do Freedom &amp; UA at same time chances are the pulls will combine. Ink will be a seperate pull regardless.
10897	You don't get karma from self-posts...	but...buttt...than they can't get internet points too? I agree with you. If i have any issues with things, the first thing i do is go to google and see if it's a popular issue in different forums etc (usually finding a link to reddit where it has already been discussed.) That's how i solve my issues. The problem with the internet so easily accessible now, is that any one time bug or inconvenience turns into everyone coming to forums and in this case, an XB1 sub, and complaining. It's a bug, go to the proper place to submit feedback...
10898	She ain't dead, Jim.	Tokyo Ghoul Re: 56
10899	Yeah, cause smites not a moba	Yeah it looks like smite with no lore and fancy graphics.
10900	Thanks for the suggestions	Come to r/mechanicalkeyboards for ~~better~~ more suggestions :P The G710+ has a nonstandard bottom roe, making custom keycaps difficult to buy. The CM Quickfire XT is a better value at your price range. You could also get a TKL like the KUL ES-87 or CM QFR.

10902	Cool guild name bro.	PoonSlayaers101 G1 Guild Looking for members
10903	Sounds like that motherboard wasn't even available in England to begin with.	TIFU by my putting my PC in sleep mode This happened nearly 2 weeks ago. Bare in mind that I don't have the swaggiest PC in the land of the yolo master race. So, I was playing GTA 5 and then I had to go outside for two hours to watch a movie in the cinema (can't remember which movie it was). Instead of shutting my PC off or even exiting GTA 5, *like some kind of alien would do*, I just alt tabbed and put my PC into sleep mode. No problem. BUT WAIT! It wouldn't fucking exit out of sleep mode. I shut it off and switched it back on. Started for three seconds. Shut itself off for two seconds, and then it started but didn't display any image on any monitor and my keyboard didn't light up, neither did my mouse. That fucking motherboard shat itself on me. Now I have to wait 2-5 weeks for a new motherboard, because the only socket 1156 motherboard available in England has to be delivered from China. I can't play Just Cause 3. That's the real TIFU.
10904	Any series that goes past three automatically falls into this category	I honestly think Furious 7 fell into this category. Although it's not low budget, I just thought it was so ridiculous it was hilarious
10905	so it is true then, tan fat does equal muscle	Sunshine Keeps Us Skinny? A Little Sunlight Can Slow The Progression Of Obesity And Diabetes
10906	Oh... I like jokes.	I was just making a joke lol
10907	igaf when we lose though :'/	idgaf, we won!!
10908	Not for hating fat people...	there's a subreddit for adultery? sheez there really is a subreddit for everything.
10909	Yes, which is racist.	That would be bigotry based on religion, not race. There are all kinds of non-racial groups you can be prejudiced against. (Gays, for example.)
10910	"I've never known anyone to rob a corner store for *weed* money."	Fucking meth eats souls.
10911	Me too.	Thanks! I love Burzum.
10912	I started reading that thread but then I read about rich people in Russia who use taxis that are luxurious inside but look like ambulances on the outside so they can easily get through traffic and I just got so angry that I had to stop!	I thought that comment was made by one of our own. :-) Oh yes, the "what do rich people buy that most people don't know about" thread.

10919	I thought it was a standardized test, in which case the student would never get their test back, just the scores.	In reality, not really. As soon as the teacher goes to give the graded tests back to the students, he'll be able to see the name on the paper he hands back to this guy. As soon as he finds out the kid's name, insta-fail. The ONLY instance where this MIGHT work is if this test was the final exam.
10920	I understand this reference!	Chase it around until it decides it's less effort to just be nice. What could go wrong?

10923	Meh, just chipped my polish.	Alternatively, you can take the tip of the nail of one thumb and pinch down hard on the top of your other thumbnail!
10924	Yeah, don't you just hate it when other people have.. *empathy*, ugh.	This annoys you in some way?

10926	Destiny.	What is your 'Go to' game? When I have a spare half hour here and there, I can't get into the story mode side is games through fear of getting too absorbed and not wanting to leave the house. Currently I'm playing PGA Tour whenever I get a spare 10 mins or so, and occasionally I will play a game on FIFA. What are some of your go to games when you have only a small amount of time?
10927	I've been using the same ghetto ass $7 wire nippers I got on sale at Radio Shack 4 years ago and it shows on all my shitty builds.	40 dollars for a pair of cutting pliers? Jesus. I cant afford that. Gunpla is expensive...

10933	All the more reason to just ban all semi-automatics, right?	What they don't understand is that for 95% of the time the military uses the m16/m4 on semi instead of automatic to conserve ammo and increase accuracy. Burst or automatic fire is way to inaccurate and only a waste of limited ammunition.

10940	I ride my bicycle everywhere, and it's nice to get directions to places sent to my wrist so I don't have to try to navigate using my phone.	For those of us that aren't technically allowed to have phones at work, let alone carry them around, having notifications on your wrist without the taboo of pulling a phone out of your pocket would be pretty great.
10941	My PC is my family.	Spend time with your family this holiday! It's easy to get swept up in Steam sales, new hardware, peripherals, etc. during the holidays. But regardless of how deep GabeN pillages your pockets this year be sure to set aside time for family. Unlike your glorious rig, family will not always be around so be sure to spend time with them when you can. No one ever regrets spending *too* much time with family.

10946	Honestly, if you want to work for the rr, it may be worth relocating for.	It doesn't look to promising for me. I only have #3 checked. Plus, It doesn't look as if any of the RR's are hiring in my area (St.Paul/Minneapolis). What would be a entry level job to be on the lookout for?
10947	Luckily this conflict can be solved simply by seizing limited amounts of territory.	Ramadi has been taken from ISIS, Iraqis say
10948	*coughs* japanese-american relocation in 1942... *coughs*	Please, how many veiled threats of nuclear standoffs has the Russian president made in just the last two years? And Russia has a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world twice over. We were actually allied with the Soviets during the 1940s if you recall. And it was the distasteful experience of McCarthyism in the 1950s that made many Americans wary of blind nationalism and political scapegoating. One of the most famous moral panic episodes in American history was turned into a play in response to that scapegoating, in point of fact. Anyway, no, we did not love communists, but we have a comparatively robust and critical civil society that is not worried about being targeted for execution or imprisonment for holding the wrong political opinions, or having dissident youth crushed by fascistic sensibilities. We do not use nationalism as a pretext to criminalize LGBT political expression, or imprison punk rockers. And so forth. Sorry, there are just some things that we do better.
10949	Hey, fuck you buddy who you calling a devolved idiocy?	I hate this stupid "no politics" rule. Why can't people just talk politics without it devolving into idiocy?

10954	If you jump off the garage: Do a flip!	Actually thinking about dealing again. So someone, anyone, please talk me out of it. I haven't been in the business for a good 8yrs. now and in that time I've consistently said I'd throw myself off the parking garage if I ever found myself behind a table wearing an apron again and, at least at the moment, I'm not really up for that. But say I did get back in, where should I think about working? I've done AC and Vegas and have no desire to be in those places again so they're not an option. I've been to Biloxi (pre Katrina) and didn't think much of it. I don't go on boats so cruise ships are out. No desire to work in Philly because, well, Eagle fans and having worked in AC I'm well versed in the ignorance of those ass hats (1960 Bitches!!). So where? Who has consistent action? Where won't I be bored to the point of being catatonic? And quite frankly I read a lot of these posts and I find myself saying 'I never heard of that bet, what the hell is that?' Has the game passed me by? Maybe I should just deal 21? I actually enjoyed dealing a little 'snapper' from time to time. Loved dealing 3 card and 4 card poker, those games are like a day off with pay so maybe I could do that. I don't know maybe I'm just being wistful. Might have something to do with strolling thru the Borgata a couple of months ago. Being in a casino again after such a long time was strange yet I had this nagging feeling that this is what I should be doing with myself. I'd appreciate an opinion or two if anyone is willing. Just try to give your opinion before you read my dealing stories because you'll just tell me the only place I should be dealing is in my local mental health facility. Thanx.

Yeah I just checked the compatibility and the hyper 212 evo I'm getting is an inch too tall for the case. I'll take the ram though. Sorry for any inconvenience :/

Every single thing in my community mailbox this week was an advertisement. Paying someone to deliver that to my door would be a ridiculous waste of money.

Right now, they are probably scheduling alot more Big 12 games for Pime time due to having 5 and almost 6 ranked teams... and after some teams lose people will be saying the Big 12 dont deserve so many prime time slots because of unranked teams in it lol
10980	As a Giants fan, I beg to differ	I don't care what the dude says, if you hate the eagles then you're wrong.
10981	Gotta be that Transformers game.	Not Cool, GameFAQs. Not Cool.
10982	I thought it was a pre req for your coaches/media/players to be arrogant cunts?	God, can't our media/players/former coaches just support England without coming across as arrogant cunts and say stupid things like this, i get that they want to support England and show that they're behind them but can't we be more subtle about it. I personally think Pooper would be over the Rood?Wobshaw? Kuridrani over Barrit , Moore over Youngs and maybe Brown to the wing over May, Folau at fullback and AAC over Watson? don't know what sort of form he's been on this world cup but he seemed very good when we played in the autumn
10983	You're probably white.	Fuck this. I am a cis woman. I am a cis woman because I was born with the body I identify with. I am not comforming to anything by being myself. I hate how they throw around the word "oppression", in regards to women in Western countries. They have trivialized it. I am not oppressed, I am fucking empowered. I am educated, I make a good salary working for a company owned and opperated by a woman. I have my own place, I can drive, vote, and participate in my community. I can have sex and relationships with men without being judged in a way that impacts my social standing in any meaningful way. *I am free to make personal choices that allow me to have the life I want for myself.* There are millions upon millions of women the world over for whom none of these things would be possible, because they are women. To say that I am as oppressed because I embrace my womanhood is an insult to me and to them.
10984	Because everyone is a trangender asexual dragonkin unless otherwise specified, and even if its stated by the creators I'm still right!	How the fuck do people come up with shit like this and ignore the fact that he's called the KING?
10985	If only there was enough space for him to back out.	This is a joke, right? Right?!
10986	you mean they didn't outright ban pizza?	I probably should've elaborated on that. We weren't allowed to go to a specific pizza store near my school because they knew boys our age would be there. With smoking, a friend of mine was seen smoking a cigarette nowhere near our campus and was asked to not come back after that school year, which is a nice way of being kicked out.
10987	Tfw you realise Hotel California was about the trench all along	You thought trench had an escape? You can only get close to the surface but may never leave.
10988	Who knew these standards were in place not to help black people, but save everyone else from Asians	Most of those less qualified students are white students. Ivy league schools have a soft quota on Asian Americans. So even though they are overrepresented, they are still far underrepresented based on merit. There are studies that detail exactly how much more an average Asian student has to score over their white and black peers to get into those schools, but you don't even need to look that far. Look at what happened in the UC system after they banned race as a consideration for admission. Asians were similarly "overrepresented" before the ban, but after race was taken out of consideration, top UC schools like Berkley and UCLA saw their Asian population sky rocket even more. If Harvard and other top institutions stopped their hidden limits and admitted students based on merit, you'd see the same thing happening there.

10993	yeah or he mistook the wiper stalk for the turn signal stalk as he was trying to merge back onto the track and finish the race.	Or he may have just hit the wiper stalk in his haste to get out of the car and see if the guy was okay.
10994	Just rest less, problem solved.	Given the brutal commutes many US citizens are forced to undertake - at least in my neck of the woods - a six hour a day workday would be a big cause for celebration. The commute + the eight hours + the unpaid lunch in between really is the whole day. When the eight hour workday was pushed back in the early 1800's, it came with a slogan - "Eight hours' labour, Eight hours' recreation, Eight hours' rest". The problem is it is no longer "eight hours' labour" - the commute as well as the mundane tedium of getting ready for work and other preparatory tasks (e.g., grocery shopping, etc) reduce that "Eight hours' recreation" to much lower than it should be. I hate that so much of our lives are spent in toil for rich masters who really *do* have tons of leisure. The CEO for my particular company makes literally 100 times my wage, and I have worked for this company for over 15 years and have a Masters degree in the field. That is just insane.
10995	I thought the point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that for her anymore.	Throwback: Classic Lisa Ann on her wedding night
10996	Ohh shiny!	TIL that there's a strong correlation between people who buy bird seed and people who usually pay their debts. Inversely, people who buy chrome accessories for their car tend to not pay their debts in full.

11005	No they'd never lie!	But I was led to believe that the bakers love gay people and that this was the beginning of rounding all real Christians up for shipment to camps! Are you suggesting that I've been lied to by conservative evangelicals???!? I'm shocked.

11012	no, creating the new world order takes effort and unpaid interns	I thought everyone at the UN gets paid a shit load, only works till lunch time, has a boozy lunch on the house and a swim in the basement pool to sober up... I assumed it was a bribe of sorts so they would keep from evolving into anything with real teeth.

11020	What the fuck did I just read?	A buddy just bought a TDI and I can literally see myself dressed up like this at his wedding. He's never getting married though.. At least I don't if to a man or a woman. He came over tripping on acid like two weeks and tried, briefly, suggesting that me, him, and our other good friend should all fuck. Came out left field man. I'm sitting like there, "okay..." We just didn't say anything. But yeah, he's got a huge Mohawk. Rides motorcross, has "gnarly" tattoos. Wears skate shoes and board shorts all the times. He's a great friend because the guy is a machine. Girls love him because he's well spoken, very handsome, but has a goofy/edgy look. Very good friend, but he's definitely not wearing a suit to his own wedding. I mean I listened to Township Rebellion by Rage Against the Machine like 12 times in a row with this kid on a drive we had a few days ago. Sometimes you just have to say fuck the norm. That's what this guy is doing in the picture. I bet him and his brahhhhs got buck wild at the bachelors party. I mean no one wearing that shit has ever actually tried to start shit with me. I'll hear them go on and on about fighting, but they won't back it up.

11023	Yeah, just like when you go to the car dealership and buy the current year's model, and then the next year when they drop the prices you get a refund!	Free to play ? Give me my 60$ back.

11027	Well if people didn't want to be hated then they shouldn't have been black, gay, fat, or poor.	In the last couple days the amount of fat shaming and just general hate towards fat people I have seen on reddit is disgusting. It is unhealthy but they are still people. I have literally been at a loss for words about how some of the things are getting upvoted. They act like fat people are worse than murderers and rapists. I know some people are lazy etc but it is just as bad as being a racist or hating all poor people for being poor. I am not targeting this at you just a in general rant.

11034	Sure, sounds like it	There were plenty of nights I was in a position I could have, and exponentially more when friends of mine could. Totalled a car at 17 doing 90 in a thirty five on a bunch of pills. Wasn't hurt, I lost some of that speed by the time I hit the tree. Constable showed up, family is a big donator, told them I swerved to miss a, deer so they reported so. So hammered I could barely stand and they don't do anything but give me a ride home. Had a new car a few days later. Didn't stop me from being a dumb ass for the next five years. I'm a perfectly responsible adult now. I just don't like people passing this kid off as a scumbag when they know nothing other than the mistakes he has made. Sure the system is rigged, it always has been, that's why you fight to get to or stay on top.

11036	Why was the second season bad?	This season blew my mind.. In a bad way. The first season was one of the best season of television i have EVER seen. Just utterly fucking fantastic. And the second season was one of the very WORST. Its the first show i have ever hate-watched, out of pure morbid curiosity. Terrible. I yelled at my tv so many times because i just couldn't deal with its awfulness

11039	shit likes this makes me wish we prioritized research over blowing the shit out of other countries	When I first started staying at Ronald McDonald House, I met another kid of similar age to me. He had lost one of his eyes to cancer. We used to play together, watch cartoons, etc. After a while, he started acting strangely. We were both really sick from chemotherapy and radiotherapy but this was something different. He didn't want to do anything. Wouldn't talk to me or look at me. I didn't understand. My Mum found out and had to tell me that they found cancer in his other eye and it would have to be removed, too. So he knew that he would be blinded within a couple of weeks. He was only seven. That kind of shit from the hospital still has me waking up in a panic at night.
11040	That's a pretty specific nerd specimen	You have to go out and do things which you love doing. Then you're automatically around people who are (in theory) interested in the same thing you're passionate about. I met my boyfriend at a language conversation group because I'm a gigantic language nerd. He's a gigantic language nerd too so it works.

11044	Yeah I'm thinking that if they play good coverage on our WR then Riddick/Abdullah could have big receiving days	Mismatches is the name of the game, especially for Lombardi. LBs will have a hard time staying with AA as any one would as long as Stafford can put the ball through "Stafford Windows" like he can.
11045	Real Deal Vs Head Ice would work as well	Ya but that's the only one
11046	Why end here?	I've created 2000 reddit accounts just for this thread
11047	I hope you screen shot the conversation and keep it somewhere as proof in case something spreads	Good looking out! I will talk to my superiors on monday and my Spanish colleague as well.
11048	They eat bear paws	I get the point..but in practical terms the foot wouldn't be the best part to eat; there's no meat on it
11049	I'm from socal, and whenever I drive up to see my friends near San Jose/Milpitas, I noticed that people are less aggressive there	I just moved to Silicon Valley / South Bay area and there seems to be a good balance of politeness and assertiveness here.
11050	"If we ban slavery, whose gonna pick the cotton"	Most americans don't want to pay $5 for a tomato.
11051	If you dig in a pile of humus you find earthworms by the spadeful, If you look for weapons in the homes of people who frequent radical mosques.......	...rare in the same way earthworms are rare.
11052	Last time nukes were used it involved a menstruating female tbh	Yeah because we can't function when we're on our periods....
11053	I don't think you know how fire works.	If you even went near to fresh lava you would go up in flames

11060	The horse is already dead, put the fucking bat down.	Why would Sami Zayn wear El Generico's mask? That would be like Hulk Hogan wearing Mr. America's mask...
11061	The Char Bar has a jack fruit bbq sandwich that is tasty	I've always thought a BBQ place with well advertised vegetarian options would be a success...
11062	Sending you hugs, a comfy pillow, and cups of sweet chamomile tea!	A week ago today I posted on here that my eggo was preggo. I'm currently having a miscarriage and it is awful, bloody, and painful.
11063	The R8 is the new revolver that was introduced a few weeks ago	Uh, why is this cs related?
11064	For all intensive purposes, that word played joke very well.	I think he was making a word play joke.

11067	"James Cameron is directing aquaman!?"	Literally the only reason I would ever watch an Aquaman movie.
11068	Salt	The debate for the GOAT between Manning and Brady won't be decided by stats. The media has already cemented the winner.
11069	... Mascot for a climbing wall.	Possible jobs; pin cushion, dart board, javelin judge...
11070	Man, these are some bull fucking shit hits that the Giants are getting.	GDT 5/16/2015: San Francisco Giants (18-18) at Cincinnati Reds (18-18) 7:10 PM ET No one else made a GDT so im taking responsibility. REDS LINEUP SS Cozart LF Byrd 1B Votto 3B Frazier RF Bruce 2B Phillips CF Boesch C Barnhart RHP Leake
11071	You forgot the *tips fedora*	I'm fine with that, have your taste, but an intelligent person can always differentiate between something being a matter of taste or bias, but that is just my 2 cents.
11072	.rar files are just compressed folders like .zip You can download an app called RAR Expander for free to decompress them	I'm running into a lot of .rar files? I don't know what these are
11073	What about a Miata with an LS swap?	In that case, Fox body with mods is better than either lolol

11075	Please read the FAQ before posting this kind of question	Isn't it on the right side of the page?
11076	Black spindle is exactly like black hammer just exotic	it is a new year, Armor would be nice to be able to move forward.... but alot of Y1 weapons were too OP ( See: Fatebringer, Legendary Black Hammer, VoC, Gally) , so things stay behind. Y2 items will probably get left behind in Y3, so on and so forth..... all in the name of progress
11077	It's the new Bakken crude oil train feature!	I dont think its supposed to do THAT.
11078	That's one of the most overloaded kits I've ever seen.	Champion concept : Cerastes

11080	Pls be gentle ;)	My right hand has ascended today!
11081	Can anyone contribute to the app too?	Wikipedia Android app, now with interactive map, named a Best App of 2015
11082	it is still not a compensation for the earlier accessible Zhonya's and how it takes AD mids out of the game earlier.	I would balance it when adding in Auto attacks using the AD increase, while the AP gains the stats only on their burst and abilities. Zhonyas seems an all in burst item and use active to mitigate damage. Maw is to survive a burst round and output sustained damage and put pressure on objectives which you can force easier.
11083	I welcome our flying ant overlords	Someone at work just referred to today as "flant day" purely because of the flying ants.
11084	I thought he was dead until the end thank god.	Relax

11088	I guess this is neglecting the ones that actually have valid science behind them, right?	'Self-help': The other fantasy fiction
11089	Maybe cause pedophiles just look like regular people till you know they fuck kids.	It's only after they're revealed as pedophiles that we realise how much they always looked like pedophiles.
11090	We're still waiting on that good season from Adam Morrison	The lakers deserve a good season from Randle
11091	Same, coulda sworn i had tracklists for all my recent stuff.	Did mixcloud delete track listing on their website? Hey guys. Since yesterday I have been unable to see any track listing on mixcloud. Apparently it is still available on the smartphone app. Anyone else having this problem?
11092	Fox News	Do you know of any politicians or media that do not lie?
11093	Stanley the manley	Schrute Bucks
11094	Well they do call me Sir-Mix-A-Lot	Do you guys like big butts? New Hogue Big Butt grips for my Dan Wesson 715 .357 Magnum
11095	Yeah guardian entrys with an awp that is just noob gun he should use a mans gun like friberg.	You cannot compare an AWPer who has his whole team playing around him to a rifler like that... Just pure silliness.
11096	There should be a subreddit with links only to articles/posts where this happens	I think I've made it to stage three roughly 5 times.
11097	You *must* be talking about the third one; there's *no way* it could be anything else...	The best part is that one special episode... You know what I'm talking about.
11098	Like when capitalism solved Jim Crow and segregation without any government interference?	Yeah and you go into the town and serve them and become rich. That's how capitalism is supposed to solve everything in theory. We're all supposed to be responsible consumers and boycott places like this on our own. This place should have gone out of business just by being on the news doing this. Not forced by the government to do something against their stupid opinion
11099	Thanks for the advice	You can challenge that decision with a manager. If your device isn't abused they'll probably reverse that decision. If your device really is messed up, then you gotta own it though.
11100	there's definitely a point, same one for banning the racist user actually	If there are no racist users then while you could ban the racist subs there wouldn't be much point.
11101	Germany is so fucked, but hey, they want to get fucked so let them.	Germany to Spend $6.6 Billion on 800,000 Refugees and Migrants
11102	You played me like a damn fiddle	I thought you'd get stuck on that.
11103	Done :)	pm
11104	Never seen this before, very original	Are you sure this game is PG-13?
11105	Let's just bomb Mexico instead	We need a final solution to the illegal problem. Let's guard the border like East germany or North Korea and just shoot them.
11106	Like we complain about Fox News but this is honestly much worse lol.	seriously, who moderates this circus? this sub has turned into a bubble where real information from the real world simply doesnt enter.
11107	Right now, preferably ;)	so... when should I suck it?
11108	I currently have Austin Seferian-Jenkins as my backup but I'm wondering if I should go with him or look for someone else.	Well poop. Should I pick up Vernon Davis, Charles Clay, Eric Ebron, Richard Rodgers, Mercedes Lewis, Dwayne Allen, Austin Seferian-Jenkins? Or Ladarius Green?
11109	How's your fedora?	Not me. I tell children on the playground to fuck themselves when they cut me in line for the slide.
11110	Excellent feature if you ask me!	Ah, Facebook on this day. AKA the daily deletion.
11111	No, we would just need to find a new pump and dump, anyone up for some $NQ ?	Just a thought about this sub $AMD If amd crashed this sub is over :)
11112	At the point where I can play it with a Dualshock 2.	I love when people throw out buzzwords like forced gimmick on things they don't like. The gamepad has been part of the Wii U since the beginning and part of star fox zero's development since the announcement of it. At what point does it stop becoming a forced gimmick to you and start being just part of the game?
11113	We know that carbon emissions from cars are bad, but hey, we're still driving.	And people there get fucking mad when you suggest that coal is bad
11114	Did that shotgun idiot say something similar to this or am I imaging things	How rare is it that our catcher is chinese...
11115	Your 'daughter'....... It's okay, you can say you want one for yourself	Gonna sign my daughter up for this.
11116	Surprised no one has mentioned this: Pre-gaming.	What always sounds like a great idea, but never is?

11119	Its kinda hard for him to not see them tho.	flusha doesnt either. Kappa
11120	Depends on how she feels about Muslims in our country run by a Muslim president who isn't even American!	Or a Republican vice presidential nomination.
11121	E la pasta?	La pizza perfetta la fanno da Eataly e ha pomodoro fresco, salsiccia di Bra, stracciatella e olio crudo. STOP.
11122	Turkey should convert to christianity and join the EU, since they are so racist anyway.	In photos: Turkey halts hundreds of migrants at EU's borders
11123	I thought it was a bad pun as opposed to product placement.	The Uber product placement was so forced. "Navigating your first training camp can be uber confusing." Seriously? And if it wasn't meant as product placement, then what are the editors doing? That was so awkward.
11124	Doesn't she know she belongs in the kitchen?	When I was on vacation in Vegas I saw a pregnant woman that's drunk and stumbling down the sidewalk barefoot while shouting profanity.
11125	Something very odd is going on because RD and LDN indicate dietitian which is the good ones but that they don't want to be called a dietitian but instead a nutritionist which is the woo woo ones.	Yeah, when I called to set up the appointment I was corrected when I said dietitian. Her card says 'Nutrition Counselor'. The letters after her name are MA, RD, CSSD, LDN, but I have no idea what any of those things are other than MA.
11126	God 'hopes you find what you're looking for' and stuff.	My breakup letter to God. Still no response...
11127	Mate he's Irish born and bred	Grealish too
11128	The tea party would call him a CINO (Catholic In Name Only)	What If Pope Francis Was A Member Of Congress?
11129	"given X funding over 10 years"	Fission. Fusion is the tech the nuclear industry has been describing as 10 years away for over forty years.
11130	I don't think Ched Evans was trying, I think he just got lucky	Morrison and Ched Evans are the only ones who are even trying............................................. Maybe Sakho too but he hasn't succeeded
11131	But Sasha is my bae tho.	Really? I mean, it's your money and you choose how to spend it and all, but you're cancelling your game over 4 characters not being in? Think about all the other features that they are giving you. 120+ playable characters, completely revamped MyCareer mode, Create an Arena and Championship are back, gameplay is alot smoother, NXT stars a-plenty, Joey Styles on commentary for 2K Showcase, and you're cancelling over just 4 characters?
11132	Bloodcyka?	Picking to jungle anyone not named Chen, Enchant, or Engima.
11133	"The muslims may take our lands, but they'll never take our pork!"	Braveheart: Freedom Speech
11134	Nice, happy to see how well it went with all the bombs called in to ruin it.	Part 2 or 2nd panel after bomb threat #Gamergate #SPJAirplay Event Second Panel after Bomb Scare
11135	Do you want something hammered out at the forge or are you just looking for the silvery black finish characteristic of wrought iron?	That's actually pretty cool, but it's still a wrought iron fence though.
11136	Sorry he can't do that, Labour does not allow infiltrators	My Dad rejoined, which I find odd as he seemed to be a kipper. Potential (late) midlife crisis?
11137	Yes, there's a reason why it's called the cheat stick.	Is it bad to use the C stick? When I ask that I don't as in frowned upon in the community, I mean as in habit wise. I ask because the C stick is my go to when doing smash attacks and some air attack. Is it a crutch that I kinda just need to ween myself off of? If so what's the easiest way to do so? Thanks :)
11138	"Thats a good cow, we're going to eat you last"	Dairy cows are the only cows that can usually be trusted not to attack people. Why? Because of the daily POSITIVE interaction with humans. Although, there is the rare cow that is just nice. One defended my uncle after another gored him. Hell, she even got between me and the rest of the herd when I was helping out. All she asked for in return was her neck scratched.
11139	How can AI have feelings	Here is a place where we can discuss our feelings.
11140	But I thought they were freedom loving Syrians like the ones in Iraq and Libya	How are they going to invade the country they come from?
11141	E.T for sure	So counter question. What's your most underrated games?
11142	Ok you don't need to rub it in man	No rain today, it was such a beautiful fall day. Vaping on Hiss tank.
11143	Ya a good old booty to show off in you man's leggings.	well, both would be kinda nice, actually
11144	I would be fine with this!	I think they should both remain after death.
11145	The question is how long does a smartphone's battery with GPS on work?	Slovenia should pack them into buses, drive them around a bit, then release them at the Croatian border during the night and tell them they're at the Austrian border.
11146	I know right, I hate when people change their body for themselves, it's like come on, I don't like that, so why would you do it?	I hear ya there! My favorite waitress went and did this to herself and totally ruined her beautiful hair. So sad!
11147	But guuuuuys, Age of Smegmar is really good.	Fantasy gets killed off and then suddenly Vermintide, Mordenheim, Total war. -Slow clap for GW- Maybe in the process of killing off fantasy they started loosening their leash on the license, allowing these games to be made? No idea. Just seems like a kick to the nuts that they basically drop the IP and only then does some awesome stuff start getting made for it.
11148	But he didn't score a second so it wasn't good enough	Hold up play was great, came close and hit the bar, put players through a few times. He had a good game.
11149	I dont think so, the long-ranged scanners will bring you down, i think you might have been able to do it if you had an automated reloader instead	Do I have a shot against the flagship with this setup?
11150	Inb4 he just want to change his haircut and getting out of groups is just an little addition	Tres Saranthus "If we get out of groups I'll shave my head when..."
11151	No, you'd be provoking them.	So if China builds a watch tower in my front yard, Im breaking Chinese sovereignty by getting my mail?
11152	Absolutely	Either way, I think we can agree that this racist bitch shouldn't have a job (ironic, since we always bitch these chimps need to get jobs).
11153	Because they're sure gonna take this thread seriously.	Dear Jagex,
11154	Not sure how that adds up to idiot, probably rely less on repetition and have a more solid case.	You're an idiot.
11155	So you can get hired by Amazon to run their Mail Service obviously!	Not sure why anyone would want to do this these days. I had enough of running mail servers about 5 years ago and would rather it was someone else's problem.
11156	Protect the right to casual racism!	This is what happens when you live in a country where the government isn't paranoid about saying something racist or stereotypical about minorities. If it ever stops it means that Taiwan is going down the crapper just like Western countries are.
11157	that fucking hair is spot on	The entry-level alt girl starter pack
11158	Patent case from Satoshi incoming in 3..2..1..	Citibank Is Working On Its Own Digital Currency, Citicoin
11159	Anything that isn't STEM, aka the only fields that matter	How would you describe an "ivory-tower field"? I have never really heard this term before.
11160	I might be interested	Would you be interested in being a member of a criminal mastermind squad? Assembling one soon for this weekend.
11161	Meat cube is pretty easy to get on in basement one and is great for all blindfolded challenges.	Youll run out of bombs way before fight with mom
11162	They are his pubes...	Oh god, I thought he wasn't wearing pants and those were his pubes. AWughghghghhg cannot unsee!
11163	BRITISH GUMMY PIGS FOR BRITISH WORKERS!	I give it 2 hours before I see someone sharing astory on facebook about how 'Muslims have banned Percy Pigs from being sold, share if you think we should kill the lot of them' Or something to that effect.
11164	RIP team pebble is kill	Figured out why my PT fogs up. Case on one side isn't sealed (bottom pic) and it doesn't stay pressed together.
11165	That sounds like a dream.	I have. Believe me, by the power and fury of the facepalming gods I have. I wrote a list of all the steps to take to do basic things on the internet. He is a 64 year old alpha male who has never asked for directions in his life. Guess how much of his idiot son's advice he takes.
11166	Yes we must achieve balance ... all or nothing is balance ... sort of.	Why are so many people ITT bitching about his illegitimate child? Like ok its a shitty thing, would you prefer if he was an asshole to his daughter as well and neglect her?
11167	Next time I'll listen :-)	I warned you
11168	Sorry I dropped this earlier	Biggest problem of the sub summed up in one sentence.
11169	Nah bro, my van and pot smoking inspire me to create pamphlets at staples which will fund all those parks	Goddammit we keep on going over this every time this picture keeps showing up 1. He is doing it legally 2. Most of the animals are either to old and getting in the way of other animals of it's species breeding, or as a form of population control so they want hunters to kill these animals. 3. A large amount of the money Africa gets to protect these animals comes from legal hunters showing up to hunt these animals. You think game wardens, fencing and all that other shit used to protect them is free?
11170	But who wouldn't want a commissar that wears nothing but a greatcoat and a smile?	a lot of these are NOWHERE near GW style lol, but there are some good links in here thanks for sharing specs.
11171	Well taking pants off leads to three year olds giving blowjobs, duh!	My niece just got expelled from school for convincing another child to take off his pants. But she is three years old so I don't understand why it is such a big deal.
11172	3d printing has obviously failed us all.	THIS JUST IN: UNDERWEAR MADE FROM PLA ARE NOT COMFORTABLE.
11173	oh snap	You sound like the kind of person who would fast-forward through the servant scenes in Downton Abbey.
11174	Stay classy meetme~	Oh MeetMe...
11175	Obama.	What are some important figures in history and the media that people may not know are Socialist?
11176	God	If you had to choose, which fictional charactar would you like to be and why?
11177	How did it feel meeting Obama?	Spent my day hanging out with Barack Obama!!!
11178	This is a Minnesota sub, please get your hick associated out of here.	As a Des Moines, Iowa season ticket holder, I can confirm the last sentiment.
11179	Yeah, let's go heathstone way and only have a set of prepared positive messages.	Why not have swear words blocked for everyone? This is just an idea I'm throwing out, what if all swear words were banned for everyone, not that I'm against using them but I was wondering like how that would effect people's take on conversations in league, because then I feel people would less likely troll or tilt that way, what do you think? :P
11180	Patriarchy made her do it, make her president at once you cis scum.	Men are violent! Woman murders child services worker after losing custody
11181	I think you misspelled "states' rights"	TIL the 1860 Declarations of Secession of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia alone mention the words slave or slavery 83 times.
11182	Yeah, Cousins' TD:INT ratio totally proves that he really knows how to get the ball to his receivers when they are covered	I just don't think rg3 can play at all anymore. He doesn't seem confident in the pocket. He can only make a pass at the receiver if he's wide open. Kirk Cousins really knows how to squeeze it in there and he looks really good in the pocket. Rg3 looks exactly the same as last year. Stagnant offense that shuts down in the red zone.
11183	Why do you think he never came back?	Wouldnt he just cancel himself out then?
11184	typically rude cyclist	I'd rather solve the negligently homicidal driver problem first and work downward from there.

11196	$35 AUD then	$19.99 CAD
11197	huehue	Read my flair
11198	Threshold?	What name would you guys come up with for a Cape who works a lot like Doormaker, but he needs the frame already made for him, so his power can only work by connecting similar structures, like a door with another similar door, or a window with another similar shaped window.
11199	Much less so than the theistic ones.	Are you seriously implying this sub is not a circle jerk?
11200	'why is my nurse eating food out of the bin?'	It sits there until around 4, when "the craving" hits. I've taken donuts out of the trash before.
11201	That sounds more like it would create a black hole.	Sjwkin
11202	Poor Bulls fans, having all those great Jordan years offset by Derrick Rose and his downfall and dislike.	"Derrick Rose is a top 10 point guard" My friend is convinced of this and won't listen to me when I tell him that's not the case. What are your arguments for or against this, if you can back it up with stats that would be great.

11206	And autism	I guess this is one way to try to Boost attendance.
11207	... You guys just want announcements so you can bitch some more about how it's not Battlefront 2 anyways	a person with a backbone who knows that they oraly obligated themselves to divulge something should at least SAY if they no longer can.
11208	Or maybe some teams just tilt	I am very disapointed of fnatic... Perfect split, top 100 kor challenger, serioussness... and still they lose so I'm not sure what to think about it.

11212	it'd have to be an amazing contrast level to make up for color shift and borderline bad response time.	Nah, VA is great. It's a little worse on the viewing angles and color accuracy but still much closer to IPS than it is to TN. Response time is between TN and IPS as well. It's got way better contrast than either, which is much more important than a slight color shift. It killed me a little inside to leave behind the VA Eizo Foris for the IPS g-sync predator. The VA panel simply looked better.

11219	I haven't played Adept in 2 but it's amazing in 3.	I do enjoy playing "mages" typically, although for some reason or another I don't think I've ever actually tried the adept in ME1. How do they hold up in ME2 and 3?

11227	I feel like you have an impressive amount of self awareness about this kind of thing.	I don't have an answer for your question, but I will give you a flip perspective. I'm the "better at everything" younger sister and the amount of things I stole from my older sister is ridiculous - taste in music, films, art, things that are cool and important, lessons in dating, career direction, desire to study abroad, ideas about things that are interesting and worthwhile. All of these were HIGHLY influenced by my sister and they're a response to her own tastes/ideas about these things. Also teachers and family friends had a lot of good-will towards me due to my sister. It's a lot easier to be better than your older sibling, if your sibling's doing all the hard work before you. I just built on top of what my sister had already made. It also made me mature faster because I was trying to keep up with my sister (rather than my friends). Your brother probably owes you a similar debt (even though he/you may not recognise that now).
11228	I'm super duper sorry that the dogs play area is not up to your standards	Can't look past the dirty floors to see the aww.
11229	Yeah but deacon vouched for you so you're legit.	I did the same. Full Brotherhood T-60e set. "Know that the brotherhood are our enemy and we must fight them in our top secret operation red glare" or something. I was just confused like, guys, should you really be telling this to someone who just walked down here? Nevermind the fact that I'm wearing fucking power armour.
11230	Shhhhh let me have my moment.	The Jets do not have one win against a team with a winning record this year. We did play the Pats close and it may be a different story during the week 16 rematch, but in hindsight, we had a very easy schedule for the 2015 season, and this makes our 8-5 record not as great as it sounds.

11232	Well these 4.5 billion dollars ain't gonna collect itself you know, gotta use what you have	Disney needs to calm the fuck down.
11233	Have you tried the CF doctor list in the sidebar?	I hate this I can't stand the fact that I can't get my freaking tubes tied if I'm 23 and single, even though it would be dangerous for me to have children. I haven't used a form of bc that didn't make me feel like crap with nonstop stomach pains, nausea, or exacerbated my emotional issues, and I don't want to have children because they aren't a thing I ever saw myself having. I hate the fact that married women HAVE to get CONSENT from their husbands to get their tubes tied, while a MAN can get a vasectomy whenever they please, no consent needed. A woman's body is HER OWN, nobody should have a freaking say in what we do with them!

11238	If the task can take advantage of the multiple cores (editing usually can do this) then the FX6300 should be superior.	Hey guys I dig all the feed back. It is much appreciated! I will have to throw in an Intel build for sure! Do you think the FX6300 might be a better over all CPU for everyday tasks/work/editing/gaming then the G3258? I had that in mind. Let me know what you think. Not arguing with your points just curious. Thanks!
11239	When I was 13 I got a 3rd birthday card form my grandparents.	One year, I got a card from my Grandma. It was just the front torn half of a birthday card. A $20 was taped to it, and all it said was: "Eric. -Grandma" I'm assuming she couldn't get a ride to the store, found a card someone had given her in a rush, tore off the part with her name and put it in the mail. Best card ever ha-ha

11252	If you still lived there for two years (primary residence) and all you did was rent out a room, I don't see why you can't take the full exclusion.	While Owner Occupied Rent a room out - Does this still count as principal residence? While Owner Occupied Rent a room out - Does this still count as principal residence? **I could not find anything on the IRS that explains this scenario. So if I live in a house and rent a room for 2 years, does occupying while renting out still count the house as a principal residence?** This is for the $250,000/$500,000 exclusion. I know the rule has change so that you have to occupy it for 2 years first before fulling renting it out to get the complete exclusion. I also know any depreciation taken/allowed has to be added also. The IRS phone number seems to be all out =/ They say they provide phone service until April 15 (but no when they resume) :(

11272	Damned liberals regulating construction sites... slowing down production and making them safe and all that.	I've seen footage of this from all over, and this has got to be the most mind-boggling negligent bullshit I have ever seen in my life. That construction sight had over a dozen cranes all over it and thousands of people were constantly on foot directly underneath them. Of course dozens of people were killed when one of them falls. In America there are at least 20 construction crane collapses every year and none of them have taken out several dozen people in a single collapse. Why? Because you don't let thousands of pedestrians mill through a construction zone all hours of the day, that's why.

11274	why does a playing space need to be 12 square meters?	So if the Hearthstone tavern was real, just how big would the inn be? "Ha, find a seat if you can!" * So I was wondering how big the inn would be if Hearthstone was IRL, I did some maths and this is what I found! * Let's assume all 'playing spaces' (two chairs and a table) are 2m across and 3m in length. Then add 1m to each for space around the table. This is a total of 3m in width, 4m in length (12m^2). * As this is an inn, where we play Hearthstone all night and want a beer or five, the Innkeeper has decided to split the tavern into sections of 50 tables, with one side of the section hosting a bar. This bar space is 8m across and 6m in length, **a total area of 48m^2.** Between each section is a walkway of width 4m, meaning we add 2m to the total width of each section. Therefore, the dimensions of each section are 152m across, and 206m long. **The total area of each section is 31,312m^2.** * Here's the juicy bit - The most recent statistics published said there are 30 million Hearthstone accounts. Of course, millions of these will be inactive, bots, or several belonging to a single user. So let's put the figure of active accounts to half the total number - 15 million. Of course, the Innkeeper is taking no chances. When there's a big event on, such as the release of TGT, he's going to try and accommodate as many patrons as he can. Let's put this figure at 8 million spaces. The Innkeeper does have a revenue of millions of pounds, but refuses to spend it on expanding his tavern, so 8m is the figure we'll use. **8,000,000 players means 4,000,000 tables. This means 4,000,000 tables divided by 50 tables per section - 80,000 sections.** The total area of these sections including bars and walkways, thus the total area of the Hearthstone tavern is: **80,000 x 31,312m^2 = 2,504,960,000m^2, or 2.5 million square metres, or 2,505km^2.** * *So how big is 2,505km^2?* The Hearthstone tavern is larger than the total landmass of the state of Rhode Island, and only 400km^2 smaller than the total size of Rhode Island and Delaware **combined**. **It is also larger than many countries, most notably; Vatican City, Monaco, Gibraltar, Macau, Barbados, Singapore, Bahrain, the land mass of Hong Kong, and roughly the same size as Luxembourg.** The tavern is pretty big! I apologise for any mathematical errors, it's been a while since high school. Busy night... but there's always room for another! EDIT - formatting.
11275	Nah, you're a sucker for paying more instead of supporting the cartel with your money.	Or those of use who are more mature actually support legalization and are happy to pay the tax. It's like $47 for an 8th of great quality stuff. That's the same price we paid when I was in college if you got a single eighth. That's just me, though, crazy enough to actually vote with my wallet.
11276	I wonder if she confused an aborted fetus with a newborn infant?	Carly Fiorina: "I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, it's heart beating, it's legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain." The only problem? Nothing like that happens in the Planned Parenthood tapes.
11277	I agree.	I put a blanket statement on it but really I respect certain aspects of theology and trying to figure out what people thought of the texts in the time. However I don't like the religious presuppositions inserted into my academia and something that's accepted by many scholars as legitimate claims or study. Self authenticating holy spirit is a silly thing to bring into academia, regilious or not.

11279	but it has a 8.4 on imdb so it can't be bad you h8r	So I'm a troll for having an opinion? The first 2 are in my top 5 films of all time, the third felt rushed and the humour was lacking. I personally feel Pixar has dropped a bit of personality and soul since the days of Bugs Life and Toy Story. I tend to form my own opinions not look at a critics review to see if a film is good. I didn't enjoy it and found it mediocre compared to the original film, the OP was not asking for the most highly rated film of RT.

People tend to overestimate the calamity that a few degrees total warming brings us, and they criminally underestimate our advancing resourcefulness over even the next century. Though this article was click bait trash the research being done is exactly what we should be doing now. Even a short term pause as shown here likely bridges the gap between our desire to decarbonize and our ability to provide base load energy generation at comparable prices. That is, unless the world wants to get serious about nuclear...

11305	But you only get calories from fat!	When people see me binge, I always get "good genes" comments. It's understandable, I am sedentary as fuck and I do things like order 18 inch pizzas for myself. On my birthday I buy an entire cake for dinner and wash it down with a six pack. My favorite fast food meal is a Wendy's triple quarter pounder combo, add bacon, a spicy chicken fillet, and a side of cheese sauce to dunk it in. The truth of my genes, however, is that although I *can* pack almost anything away in a garbage truck of a stomach, I usually don't. I consume very little and am rarely hungry. Contrary to popular belief, parole like me don't just poop undigested food. The ones that really gets me are the "bad genes" people who unknowingly believe in perpetual motion machines. Genes might make you hungry or depressed, but you can't just claim "I only eat 800 calories a day" and gain 100 lbs, the laws of thermodynamics don't allow it.
11306	I don't know, but his name is obviously Vincent.	When did we start naming Purple Man Purple Guy? Around the time when FNAF 2 was already out, everyone called the mysterious murderer which 12 year old girls love Purple Man. Then, from nowhere came the name Purple Guy, time passed and everyone calls him Purple Guy now. I think that Purple Man is a better name, as you can make an acronym from it (PM) and not have it be mistaken for Phone Guy. Why did most people start to call him Purple Guy?

11313	Women can't be sexist.	Am I sexist, anachronistic, or absurd? I'm a woman in my 20s, living in a city. I recently met a man from okc and we spent many hours together talking, walking, cuddling. Towards the end of the date he invited me to come over, but I said I needed to go home. I asked if he'd walk me home (I live about 20 minutes away and it was after midnight) but he refused. It made me feel not optimistic about our potential as a couple together. He's certainly a feminist (we talked about some of his ideas). Am I in the wrong for expecting to be walked home by a potential partner? He's been sending me many messages since we met so it seems he's interested in me, but I am conflicted. Should this be a deal breaker?
11314	Yeah, His Holiness has never mentioned the plights of the Syrian Christians!	Don't You guys thing that bishop of Rome should have other priorities? Syrian christians needs weapons, ammunition, medical help and food, and pope's negligence in that case is in my opinion insulting, and incompetible with the idea of ecumenism (pope should defend christians no matter if they are catholic). I don't want to start a discussion if he is right or wrong about the global warming (personally I think he is wrong). Just want to say there are more important problems for christianity and Francis doesn't care about that. For me it's both reckless and insulting.

11318	The refs are an inside job and only want my team to lose	What is your NHL conspiracy theory? I'll give my favorite one, I have always found it strange how many southern expansion teams had early success. We all remember the controversies when the NHL started expanding in the south and people were confused as to how many hockey fans were in Florida. And to be honest they were valid points to me. Look at the Panthers, how do you make millions of football obsessed Florida natives love hockey? How about giving them Stanley Cup hockey 3 years after their inception. Heck I'm an Avs fan and I would hate to believe that either Cup win was tainted, and they are different because the Nordiques had serious talent before they moved. But do we really believe that it is *impossible* that the NHL may have pulled some strings to ensure that Roy was traded to a new market where they wanted to build a strong fan base? Let me make clear that I am not trying to belittle any teams here and I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said before. This is one of those things that I would kill to be wrong about. But at the end of the day the NHL is a business first, and to win fans the best thing to do is give them wins. Anyway this is my thought, feel free to comment on it and post other conspiracy theories.

My toons are on Cenarion Circle (Alliance), and while I'd probably want to stay in my guild (it's all work-buddies in there), I'd love to have more people to play with and talk to! Anyone in the same boat? Kinda-casual, we have jobs and maybe kids or pets but sometimes just want to kill some orcs/demons (no offence to Orcs here)?

11332	I can relate lol xD girls always tell me I'm cute and my neighbor said I'm hot (but she's not interested in me because she's an adult you know busy of course) but anyways when a girl calls me cute I'm like /.\ because just SO CUTE YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP IT xDD sucks I was born this way sometimes because :PP it's a bit awks but whatever it's okay lol one time I even WENT TO SCHOOL WITH BREAD IN MY MOUTH XDDD I didn't even notice it happen but it was in my mouth and it was SO KAWAII I was all like :3[]	anime irl

11335	Cause the moon landings were obviously faked to try and bankrupt the soviet union, duh.	Why is it we could land a man on the moon fifty years ago, and yet we still can't grow boobs in a lab. Where did society go wrong? hehe

11338	When did I miss the Xbox 369?	Which totally sucks. I understand they donot want a bijillion gamer pictures like the 369 had, so they're trying to keep a set amount. But damnit I was a way to show off another 10,000 kills!
11339	Dan Snyder is the smartest owner in football and has no history of being at odds with his coaching staff I have no idea why reporters would think that	So are Redskins fans going to keep saying "Don't believe (insert journalist name)"?

11341	I don't know that staubach is a pretty big bust	I really want his Jersey but I stay away from rookies because the last one I got was Morris Claiborne and that hasn't worked out. I think I'm gonna go throw back and grab a Roger Staubach this Off-season.

11346	Ah yes... brb	Masturbation
11347	Why not, Cena isn't done burying Ryder I guess.	Wouldn't it be cool if Zack Ryder answered the U.S. Championship Open Challenge? This could maybe turn into a storyline where Ryder accuses Cena of stifling his push, turning him heel/tweener in the process. This could give Ryder's character more dimension than the "woo woo woo guy" and give us all a break from Rusev/Cena.
11348	Stop taking the name of lord Ram in vain	Don't care about MSG, but Maggi is just shitty noodles. Top Ramen anyday.
11349	Dude that's shitty of your sisters.	Thank you. I love my mom but she was a very difficult woman when I was growing up. She was a hard woman who was very opinionated, mean like her father and controlling. I wasn't very close to her because she never changed her ways. My four sisters bailed on me when my mom got sick six years ago and we haven't spoken since. Yes. Call your parents.

Our nation has gotten so stupid I doubt we can recover. We're regressing so fast that I bet we will shatter when we hit bottom. At least we will have learned our lesson and hopefully won't make the same mistakes regarding sexuality again. There will be no doubt about the immorality of contraceptives.
11360	But... You're inside the movie studio are you not?	Found a rainbow if you stand at the right angle between light and rain. The little details are great.
11361	Maybe, but your ears are nearly invisible...	I think the distortion you're talking about is a minor deviation in the straightness of my nose due to having it broken playing sports as a kid.

11366	Yeah, in The Marine potato salad jumps out everything seconds before it exploded.	When the hero always has to save the girl at exactly the last second. Jupiter Ascending was particularly egregious about this in a number of scenes, and I think Channing Tatum saved her at the absolute last moment at least 3 times over the entire movie.
11367	Why?	Not to mention can we ensure that the TS admins all have the rcons?

11373	Don't ever do a "blind experiment" on your parents or siblings, they'll just dismiss it immediately.	Don't tell em. If you do, ask if it's been better, THEN ask about recent performance, *THEN* reveal. They'll just say it worked for a bit and stopped again.

11403	2 faerie charms, 3 mana pots and 3 health pots IIRC	League of Legends Early Build I have been playing League for ~5 years now. I'm sure there are many people on here that have enjoyed watching the game evolve from the beginning to present day. I am curious however to see if anyone would be interested in actually playing the earlier builds of the game from 2009-2011 or if it would even be possible to do so. I really loved the game at the time and I still do enjoy it but I would flip at the chance to play League again from that time period. What does /r LeagueofLegends think?
11404	holy shit thats hilarious and sad at the same time	Goldenglue earning a salary comparable to Gorilla's. Top3 native NA Mid vs arguably the best Support in S5.
11405	Why don't you just put their dicks in your mouth while you're at it?	You guys are doing great work. It is disheartening to read, in this very thread, such a variety of bad-faith defenses of bigotry and bullying. "You are VIOLATING my RIGHTS!" or whatever; you guys must be overjoyed there's only one more month of summer vacation.

11411	aura can reflect dust bullets really well but i don't think a dust propelled speed semblance accelerated blade big enough to cut a person in half would be blocked by someone's aura unless they're as strong as a giant nevermore and even then you saw what happened to it.	You could say the same about Yang's shotgun-gauntlets. Yet, look! Junior's goons have heads in one piece despite being punched in the face. Aura's pretty durable.
11412	Okay then, thanks for looking anyways	Sorry, I don't really want to trade that for Wind Waker.
11413	*flash* Well folks just some swamp gas.	Nice try MIB. You ain't fooling anyone with that username.
11414	Yeah, as a long-time Halo canon fan I also enjoyed the way a couple of S4s were literally facerolling an entire covenant army like it was nothing.	Holy shit. As a long-time Halo canon fan, I'm so happy that they're finally showing what Spartans are capable of. Plus these aren't even the best Spartans.

11422	She'll use her hamster to rationalize it as being best for the baby when all she really wants to do is cuck the beta bucks who's got the most bucks to beta for her.	I concur, or rather: I think they *do* feel remorse, but have a powerful ability to rationalize their behavior to such an extent that it overrides any doubts. "oooh I got pregnant by another guy.... but my SO always wanted a child, and it'll make him happy... yadda yadda yadda" This is the conscious act, but subconsciously she followed two powerful drives: conceiving children from the best guy available and carrying them to herm.
11423	If I was green I would die	Also turn blue.
11424	Was his fedora appropiately tipped, as is tradition?	Someone in one of my classes in uni proudly told the class that he got all his news from Reddit and I wanted to die.
11425	Actually, the death penalty historically costs more than life sentences due to time on death row and mounds of red tape.	He should spend the rest of his life in jail and nothing less. Agreed, it will be a burden on the tax payers but the death penalty is probably too easy a way out for a person like this.
11426	You know you liked it	You should really have NSFW tagged that one. I regret clicking that.
11427	Wow, it has been so long that I forgot the manga back then, while still looking brilliant, just doesn't compare to the art now.	Almost every manga I've read has changed it's artstyle somewhere in the series. Usually it's a culmination of many small changes the mangaka makes as he both adjust and improves his art. Just look at the first chapter of any long series and compare it to the latest chapter, some are monumentally different, others subtly, but there are always differences.
11428	He should have complied with the officer's orders.	Even in such a clear case a jury doesn't agree. So one bootlicker can rob justice away from this man.
11429	I'm sure the backups are just as good as Dez	Losing Romo you will lose effectiveness in the team, bur losing Dez ans Gregory? Their backups will pick up the slack with no noticeable reduction in efficiency.

11432	Hey, but at least we're not North Korea!	Does it matter if it is the most corrupt? The second most corrupt? It's very corrupt. That's all that matters. I've noticed this so much whenever I criticize the Philippines. A lot of people will say "at least hindi parang sa [insert another developing coubtry]." Why does it matter that the Philippines is slightly better than another poorly run country?

11434	With that guy from mainland China we signed, we can dominate both of the Chinas!	Chen might be a good idea to keep around if only to take advantage of the growing Chinese market. Purely from a financial side of things having Chen is a good idea. If the infielder from China we signed turns into anything than we can sell Chen.
11435	It's particularly funny to me that you can express the sentiment "act your skin color," call it fighting against cultural appropriation, and large numbers of racists who are too stupid to even realize they're racist will jump in on your side.	For the best view of Katy Perry dressed as a geisha in front of an atomic bomb blast, please put on your "whiteness goggles"
11436	Oh but that's not an acceptable form of *scientific* observation.	Well the Buddhist "belief" concerning self-hood isn't so much a belief but an observation, one possibly reproduced by anyone.
11437	Yeah that'll help.	I try to cheat once a week to help with those cravings.
11438	I mean as long as the first born is a boy who cares	I'd trade my second born for McAfee.
11439	Obviously was his ar performance on parliament	Royalty off of Epsilon!
11440	Cause then they would have to make the stage wheelchair accessible	Why can't they get bands like AC/DC, it would make me enjoy pre race conecrts.
11441	Nigel Good	Who do you think will be the next MC artist to release an LP? I dunno but for some odd reason I feel like either Stephen or Fiji could be the artist to release their debut albums. I'd like to say 7MD as well but eh, that's highly unlikely :c
11442	TIL "fuck her right in the pussy" makes the ladies fawn if your hair is done just right.	The big difference between harassment and flirting is the cuteness of the guy.

11444	didn't you hear racism is over because obama was elected and policy brutality is a thing of the past and you are just trying to start a war on cops	And, of course, if black people go into white communities to get ID, then they'll be harassed by the police.
11445	You guys are just jealous cuz you can't "create your own imagination"	MineDig: $4,200 AUD for a Minecraft ripoff set on Mars. Just one reward tier, and it's a thank you note.

11450	cant upvote this enough	You might think you are sober after 30 mins, but if you quit for a few days, you would feel totally different. You have just gotten used to it so being stoned feels normal, even though it's not.

11452	They had Fox, Captain Falcon, Little Mac, and Marth	What did they have?
11453	Smooth as eggs.	I bet they're soft as a babies bottom after.
11454	And let's face it, all these car wrecks are more than likely eliminating some of the less intelligent population...	While no one would wish for this to happen to anyone, the silver lining is that the deaths in the city (in this context) are not increasing as a result of violence.
11455	The Lions aren't comfortable playing with a lead.	meh we needed a challenge. HAVE THE BALL BACK AND SCORE WE DARE YOU
11456	florida has more freedom than the rest of america apparently Florida #1 state?	Not in Florida.
11457	It would seem the better questions isn't why snakes *still* exist, but whether snakes had legs or not before this curse.	It implies that the snake had not crawled on his belly before the punishment was inflicted.
11458	Yeah but then you'll have to drop your resolution to 640X480 to make it work.	I noticed in the demo where he walks up to the workbench the shadows in the left corner flicker and look blocky. Hopefully the PC shadows can be better.
11459	met the October quota, that means no more goals the rest of the month	Urgh. Sucks that the let in another six goa--wait, what? They SCORED six?! WHO IS THIS TEAM?
11460	Right, because there's no way my point is valid.	If that is the case, how do you not understand this?

11466	Yeah you're the person I've heard talk about him getting a mf.	Atlanta Falcons RB Devonte Freeman Most Feared Am I the only one who thinks Devonte Freeman should be the one player who gets an absolute beast card? The guy's an animal.
11467	Either that or consumes them and gains health from the remaining orbs.	Perhaps on Golgoroth, he will consume unpopped orbs after his gaze is lost and add that to the charge on the rune? This way teams are forced to do a full rotation with gaze grabbers and if they mess up early, it's pretty much a wipe.
11468	Defense	sorry , what did u say ??! Def[end] of the Ancient

11476	I can't agree with him being superb, he is only the third best player on Fnatic after all.	Agreed. No ban, no proof. What is proven for sure since, is that he's a superb player and won 2 majors for a reason. &lt;And without fishy gifs

11489	thanks for responding!	What? All I said was that you know how you've felt for over a month, so at this point you have a responsibility to cut it off. You're making it about gender. And "friend" because she's not just a friend, even if you think she is. You're sleeping with her and she caught feelings. She thinks she is more to you and you're encouraging her because you're not doing anything to discourage her, like break up.

11498	That means she doesn't have to exercise, right?	Even with X-ray vision, it's hard to see joint damage... But it's there, and debilitating, regardless if FA's refuse to admit it. 4 miles running with her knee joints, and she'd likely be immobile(r) for 3-4 weeks.
11499	Careful, I hear buschwhackers bite!	Woot woot
11500	100% positive feedback...seems legit	Was looking to buy a new jersey on Ebay a while ago and something looked a little bit off about this one.
11501	Thats why we are currently genociding all the Germans.	South Africa is allowed to attack whites
11502	What site is that so I can avoid it?	sounds like ANOTHER SITE I KNOW just kidding
11503	I oppose blacks having equal rights, but that doesn't make me racist	Disagreeing with something does not make someone a bigot. If you think it does, then you're also classifying yourself as a bigot. Opposing homosexual practise does not make someone a homophobe either.
11504	Yeah how dare CLG fans want to celebrate winning a very competitive LCS split, don't they know TSM is better because they won in the past?	CLG wins one time, and fans act like they've suddenly reached Heaven. The point of a rivalry is to observe not only the most recent game, but also everything in the past as well. This is like the two teams are climbing up a cliff, and TSM was way up there, CLG closer to the bottom, and TSM just slipped and fell a bit closer to CLG. It's all well and good to compare current situations, but history matters just as much.
11505	Maybe he's Just a fan of Ramsay Snow/Bolton.	I like your skin - rate it for me on a scale of 1-10!
11506	Machida is a can	Are you kidding me? mma fans are so fickle, you start to lose and suddenly you're a bum.
11507	Leave it to the Ruskies to build only approximately two tenths of an airport and call it a day.	1.2 Airports doesn't seem like enough for a large country like Russia.
11508	Why Tiny lil Heart :( I thought i had big heart Explain Like Im 5 Pls	Whatever your tiny lil' heart desires, young man.
11509	Amazing how many people who film police brutality end up getting arrested soon after by complete coincidence	The man who filmed the Freddie Gray video has been arrested at gunpoint
11510	of course not, rank is all that matters	never give up in matchmaking
11511	The commercials on BBC annoy you ?	As a French watching UK tv when i must be in this country for my work, i feel the same way.
11512	"I tried autism once, but wasn't strong enough"	If we believe Tumblr, half the human population are trans and have PTSD/Autism
11513	Vegans should be forced to eat meat	Whatever the brain needs to function this Vegan is lacking it.
11514	Didnt think they knew that word	What the Russians have been chanting is GOOOLLLDD.... in Russian.
11515	Glad to see you date quality men.	My British boyfriend uses that term and he knows it's offensive. He uses it to bunch up everyone from the middle east and South Asia into one word. Kind of like using nigger for all black people. I hate it when he uses it.
11516	Aches	Most teams and most top pros have internet good enough to be considered warriors really; you can count the people on the t8 teams with bad internet on one hand.
11517	I believe hyperv has a guest extensions type thing that can be installed.	Resolution I need help i have created a virtual machine running linux mint (on Hyper-v) and i cant change my resolution from x 1152x864. How can i change it in the terminal. Thanks in advance :)
11518	You might cut someone with that edge!	Shakespeare's work was not even very good in the first place, imo.
11519	and its certainly not for yandere archetypes.	It's definitely not for everyone. I don't think it's offensive to say it's not for you. It's not for most people.
11520	that's because Catholics are unwashed liberals	Yeah, you know I find it to be quite revealing that the southern portion of Louisiana, which is predominantly catholic, *is also generally more progressive* than the northern part, which is heavily protestant.
11521	Well you're gonna need help for the last bounty step too so try to find people in similar situation and plan a day to bang it out Or hunker down and change your crucible strategy to grind it out in a few hours Fireteams subreddit probably best bet although I don't see 360 posts very often 360 subreddit or bug your online friends?	Need advice for getting a team together to get the void kills for the Thorn. I hate crucible. Nuff said. I am trying to get a group together so we can take turns killing each other so we can all get the Thorn. What mode of crucible should I run? Where could I find more people? I have posted to the 100, and r/fireteams, and plan on both Destiny lfg groups. To clarify, I'm not trying to get people with this post, just looking for advice how to do this...
11522	I cannot believe how low the bar has been set in this sub.	My local pizza &amp; grill's webpage is great
11523	Don't forget the zombie monsters in the sewers.	You thought Taris, which had gang wars, a dueling arena, swoop races for the fate of Bastila, a motherfucking Rancor, and stealing the fastest ship in the galaxy from a crime lord, was BORING? You're crazy man, Taris was the best planet in that game.
11524	Typical American, obsessed with stats, as if that tells the whole story.	US Federal Government has like a 99% conviction rate
11525	I wish every tweak requester was at least 1/10 as generous as you are!	Hey guys, I'm blind - I hope this post is visible to enough people. Can someone please please make a Siri RSS reader? $1000 reward! I want to be able to add feeds and say "hey Siri reed my feeds / news" And she should say "1. Blah blah blah, 2. Blah blah blah." Where she adds a digit to each feed's post as it is read, so I can then say "hey Siri, read RSS 1 / read RSS 16" Or "read feeds starting at 10" so I don't need to hear them from beginning. I will pay 1000$ for this, and then you can sell it on Cydia.
11526	But we can't have proto-RNAs and proteins bouncing up against each other, that's commie science!	Even abiogenesis is not incompatible with God
11527	To be fair, you're comparing a polished set with something that was cut from a podcast.	Loved this delivery. It's like one hit in the middle of a long joke. Norm's didn't do anything for me. It's like this train wreck that is all ugly and you have to try to find the humor. His older stories were just a parade of humor that kept it going, like this Louis example. Norm's was more cringe than funny even though it could be re-written to kill.
11528	AoT, WA2, Clannad, all get more praise than its worth from the fanbase	What are some extremely overrated anime? My personal thoughts are Angel Beats. But since I haven't watched it yet I have no right to judge. Not really sure of anything else but I'd like to hear your opinion because I'd like to keep in mind what's overrated when I choose a new series to watch.
11529	FUUUUUUUCK THAAAAAAAAAT	Biggest human puppet in the world turns out to be a little disturbing.
11530	Yep, done :)	Can I be 'Jon Jones's Driving Instructor' please?
11531	But that has no implications about his future fitness.	Well that's all besides the point. The fact of the matter is that he's been out the majority of the season ie so far hasn't been worth his purchase.
11532	and dat kanye cameo	I know, right? Like 1 or 2 is possible but 6? That almost sounds comical. Like when Ron Burgundy and his crew fought the rest of the competing news casters.
11533	So....everyday treatment then?	I was hoping for like a mini bottle of Jameson a pillow and a free pass to browse reddit all day.
11534	As if I would stop muah ha ha	If you are arrested at any point, for the rest of the game the police can randomly pull you over and if you have a gun or a knife, you get arrested again.
11535	Okay, I think a lot of people interpreted 'earn' as 'deserved from their hard work' in the context of what you were saying.	They own the store.......people come into the store and buy things....they earned the profit. I'm not saying they weren't incredibly fucking lucky to be Sam's kinsmen...I'm saying they own the company that generates the profits, therefore the profits are theirs.
11536	I'm..Ron..Burgandy?	People break up with their parents?
11537	Thank god you pointed that out, phew, I totally couldn't read that sentence...	Anime's means "anime is", in this case you only need to write animes without the " ' " :)
11538	so charming, how were you able to resist	"I believe all nigger cunts should be owned by white men"
11539	Running KDE, ah that explains why the programmers built a sentient AI to wipe out humanity then... ;)	They run KDE too, it's truly a distopian future. Why are all the files 0 bytes?
11540	No it doesn't, you're just stupid.	of course I can it just takes longer

11544	Exactly, just being able to produce more means very little if you can't do it at a competitive price.	The reason oil is falling is just because of this. Oil is falling because OPEC is trying to curve of competition (which higher prices attract). North America is becoming a huge oil suppliers. Almost big enough to surpress OPEC. Oil production in north America is expensive. Cheaper oil discourage north American oil production. That's the reason oil is falling.
11545	You should wear a Pressiah button pin on your shirt so that Redditors might recognize your position IRL.	Well I have put off studying because this is so much more entertaining. So maybe? We'll see!
11546	I'm gonna ask her on Tuesday, ill let you know.	I would be interested to know what she would say if you asked. "What exactly would I need to change to make this a 5".
11547	Thank you doctor for your outstanding analysis of the situation	[](/chasercat)nerp. not bee
11548	As opposed to male cheaters, who are always forth right about infidelity.	"Rarely has a woman ever come clean about infidelity," So true.
11549	Oh wow, my uncle always tells me stories about Mr Reggie Iwata Miyamoto and how they started the company.	Probably. My uncle is Reggie Iwata Miyamoto. He's kind of a big deal
11550	Excellent piece of art!	Staying still all day
11551	Empty, and become wind.	Enter the Void
11552	Those four players are good riflers, ptr is bad with rifles and I'm not sure about fl0m.	2 awpers on a team = not optimal at all jw/olof device/cajunb
11553	Well my office is always losing spoons, maybe they're teleporting to your house.	A sudden influx of spoons? When my husband and I moved into our new house, we had to purchase a lot of things because it was our first time living on our own, and one of these things was silverware. We bought a set that came with the organizer, four big forks, four little forks, four big spoons, four little spoons, and four knives. Well, as I was doing the dishes, I noticed we had an alarming number of little spoons, at least 14. I thought maybe my husband's best friend had given us his little spoons, as he had the same set. But when I asked him, he said that he hadn't. Where could these extra spoons have come from?
11554	[](#Lewd)	[](#Lewd)
11555	That's 50k properties, not people.	Keep in mind almost 900,000 people live in San Francisco.
11556	Which, obviously, makes them less human and more prone to violence, like animals, right?	There's actually very strong scientific data that shows Africans have less volume to their brains than Caucasians.
11557	PRAISE THE VOID!	Nah man. Void Burn plus Energy Drain augmented with Soul Rip means that Nova Bomb is on an effective 2 minute CD with max intellect.
11558	Happens to me all the time, I think it's actually adrenaline that makes your hands tremble like that!	After a long binge of playing one night, I went to go wash my hands and they were trembling, I made the decision to play without it and hadn't looked back since this was about six or seven years ago, and now it's just weird for me whenever the controller vibration is on.
11559	mods are bad mhkay	I'd like mods tho
11560	Boy there's a hefty spoiler right there	He should have been around longer but then tatsumi would not have gotten incursio and become super badass
11561	They aged Ned and other characters, why would it be a surprise if they aged Dayne?	If it's a flashback, why "30s or 40s"? This has been bothering me since the casting was announced. It seems to be neither here nor there. I pictured Arty as being Rhaegar's age, mid-20s tops. Am I alone? This would put him in his early 40s at present time (assuming he walked away alive from TOJ), so, hmmm.... Unless they decided to combine Arthur Dayne with Gerald Hightower, in which case they could age him up for the flashback.
11562	More like 0.5%	Sex atio of India is 943 females for every 1,000 males, does that mean 57 male per 1000 male remain single? What happens to 5.7% percent of male population? I know of some people who are single by choice but they don't form 5.7 percent of my acquaintances. Where do they go, what do they do?
11563	Think Russell Crowe But with an S at the end	Toni Kroos is it pronouned like cruise as in Tom Cruise or like crow with a soft 's' an the end?
11564	mediatek to the rescue!	That's BAD for a new chip... We need Intel...
11565	I sexted and exchanged pics with the girl I lost my virginity to before getting laid.	Dickpic senders of reddit, have you ever gotten laid after sending pics ? Just wondering yo
11566	GET OUT	I think that Conformists should be allowed to live
11567	Hopefully hanging out with this guy I'm seeing but I have a feeling his interest is waning :/	Single people of Reddit, what is your plans for this weekend?
11568	Good beer does not have to be expensive, and that $27 bomber may taste like shit.	Beer. I'd rather drink water than shitty beer. Good beer is worth it!
11569	I wish Heroics dropped 645 gear and LFR dropped 630.	Yeah, I wondered why you needed proving grounds for dungeons and not raids when it was announced. I don't wonder anymore.
11570	Never made that connection before but it definitely fits the M.O.	Entitled fat women often have a princess complex. Same way fat guys often have jedi complexes. They love the idea of being born into worth instead of earning it.
11571	Right, because classrooms are so big and have so many empty desks it is possible to sit by yourself.	Loner success
11572	Fuck pollard	Today's Draw Play: "The Patriots go back to the Super Bowl"
11573	Two Become One.	What is your favorite keyblade, and why? Just wanted to know what keyblades are your guys favorite keyblades. Mine has always been the Oblivion keyblade, I don't know why it is my favorite it just has ever since i first got it back in kh1. Something about it's simple yet elegant design.
11574	Does that mean it can fix your hearing?	probably not. There are anechoic chambers that actually have negative decibel ratings. Most people cant stand to be in them for more than 30-45 minutes.
11575	So much for being secretive.	Smoking is trashy and bad for you, so thank your kids for that. As for the rest of it, you'll get what's worthwhile back.
11576	That poor child will be traumatized for life after seeing these disgusting, perverted women expose their BREASTS in public!	Rain cheque on those sandcastles dad.
11577	He is a keeper, so lets hope he never wears blue	Even in the face of hardship, proves why he's starting over the legend that is Cech. Here's hoping Courtois spends the next 10+ years in blue.
11578	The same reason white lawyers do, duh!	Also why do black lawyers need their own society ?
11579	How very Christian.	MRW One of my oldest friends says that we cannot see each other anymore as he is now born again, and I will not "Come to Jesus"
11580	They should add the hexcrest and focus sight to wyverns!	Instead of just an overdone "imbue" option, anybody else think the full slayer helmet along with the hexcrest and focus sight should have been introduced into some slayer monsters drop tables?
11581	Implying that this whole game isn't just going to be promlg sniping.	It seems to me this is the counter-weapon to the sniper weapon. I mean, whoever uses the rifle usually gets on top of a high perch, right? With getting up there made magnitudes easier, the first *real* nemesis of the rifle is here.
11582	It's like it's impossible for someone to have forgotten to charge their phone over night, or impossible for people to get up at different times of day.	People are charging the iShits in 2nd period!! 2 people are charging there icraps in 2nd period already. I'm at 94% what the hell
11583	Yeah, some of the nicest people I've ever met hated gay people	Being prejudiced isn't the same as being an asshole. It's possible to both be biased and kind at the same time.
11584	yes, but shittin' in the woods is a freaken art.	This picture just reminded me: Very recently I realized that not every man knows the joy of peeing outside. I grew up in the country, and in those parts we pretty regularly would elect to take our leaks outside. The joy of the breeze on your parts, the freedom to aim anywhere or rather *not aim at all*, or to know the stars are looking upon your junk...I thought that was all men's birthright. But I recently moved to the city, and I have been told that many cityslickers have never experienced this. I almost cried when I learned this terrible truth. Ye men reading this who have not yet peed like the free men who are your ancestors, take a lesson from OP's son's book: whip it out outside and embrace your urinating destiny.

11588	C'mon dude, the feminazis made life hard for everyone!	Why is basic life so difficult for them??
11589	Well there's another glitch In this game!	Had anyone else noticed this?
11590	Because putting your energies into your own family and advancing your own agenda is not selfish.	"It takes a selfless person to have and rear kids"
11591	Yeah, because doing things in a way what they want, how they want, when they want, just like a console, it's 100x better!	Some Windows fanboys may disagree, but OS X is 100x better than Windows when talking about NON-GAMING things. OS X is the best option for a Mac hardware. Windows will just ruin it. Good thing we are MASTER RACE and we can even install Linux on a Mac if we want.
11592	Eu timezone is not more scary than Eu servers.	you scared me with your weird timezone
11593	but socialists wear red clothes, and our army is clad in greens and browns, the colors of money.	Ironically the military and the DOD are the by far the biggest socialist program we have in the U.S. And the only one the GOP loves and considered a success.
11594	You know someone takes their shit seriously when their subs are bigger than their wheels.	Probably the best looking basscar ever built

11596	Are you part of le Reddit army?	Are you le redditor?? xD
11597	No it's people who want to preserve their strong historic European traditions.	This place has become a hot bed for racists and neo-nazis
11598	4 consecutive wins by 18+ is pretty marginal	they got marginally better by releasing josh smith and people are making a bid deal about there 4 game win streak where they beat 4 bad teams.
11599	It's genetics you cis scum!	i don't think so OP... they happen to look alike because they were both shaped by the food industry.
11600	And Benghazi; don't forget Benghazi!	New questions raised about U.S.-Saudi relationship. The 28 pages. U.S. legislators pushing to know more about alleged Saudi role in 9/11

11606	PENIS!	SEX
11607	Well to be more accurate they just decided that putting effort into the chain for a couple more years before it paid off wasn't worth it and pulled out.	And they went bankrupt.
11608	A bunch of people have it, but no one likes the attention of "world first" so they just keep it in their vault and don't tell anyone.	Has anyone gotten their hands in the Crux of Crota ? Anyone ? Ran it 3 times yesterday and didn't see anyone get it and nobody has posted about it on here.
11609	Goku or megaman other gtfo	Smash flash 2 is worth playing just because of lloyd. He's never been the same since version .4b though

11611	But isn't China ultra-capitalist and communist in name only?	How communists from communist countries feel about western capitalists
11612	Good advice but username makes me question your credibility since Jesus was obvi dyel	I was a hockey player with a similar issue, I personally would suggest you switch to some sort of ppl routine, run it twice per week but skip the second leg day, so you do push-pull-legs-push-pull-rest, that way your legs don't just atrophy, you maintain your strength, and build that upper body
11613	Common core	I'm not convinced math was used at all. I'm very confused how he came to that answer..
11614	I'm glad we were able to have intelligent discourse, thank you for your contribution.	The only question of mine that you answered is that your a smug prick. Thanks
11615	How'd you get the Charizard amiibo early?	So you want to copy my neutral B, huh?
11616	Looks like we're done here.	60 fps. That's my answer to every question.

11621	Im sure they are doing it to make the Israelis look bad.	I hate how this has to be in r/consipiracy My dad tells me this has been going on for decades, since his family *used* to have an olive farm.
11622	I broke a rib laughing	I remember a time when hilarious meant extremely amusing.
11623	Oh Cheney, never change	we just put our 4th string QB in to throw to the endzone
11624	This film dedicated to the memory of Waggleton P. Tallylicker.	I respect all the people choosing games with good stories, but I want something else. I want the most ridiculous over the top action movie possible. I want to laugh at how fucking awesome that kill was on the screen. I want it to just be the best action movie of all time with crazy scenes one right after another. Give me Bulletstorm. The best part is it was short and the story would be easy enough to convert to the big screen. Oddly the games with weak stories or short campaigns probably are best suited for a single movie experience.
11625	Get off so I can download it!	Google Maps 9.0 APK with Material Design!
11626	Thanks for pointing that out, I had no clue what he was trying to say.	I think you mean dying.

11628	The cleaning lady, duh.	Who cleans your toilet?
11629	Because dota does,and we don`t want anything to do with dota.	Why do I have to visit a LoL wiki to see damage values and scaling of abilities? Why are they not on the official League of Legends site? I mean.. c'mon Riot it's pretty sad the official site for your game doesn't have all this stuff on it. And while your at it, this info should also be added in-client.
11630	Wow that was hilarious!	the jews took it.
11631	yeah and if we balanced that with a progressive income tax on the wealthy they would all leave the state	The state is flat out broke. Cuts have to come somewhere. It sucks, but if we have to pick and choose, it's probably a better idea to fully fund pre-k and elementary education than higher ed.
11632	I can be a ninja if I want to goddammit!	Doubtful, but whatever.
11633	Yeah, but in the movie we are laughing at Charlie cause what guy wouldn't want Jennifer Anniston trying to rape them right?	To be fair, the movie takes it pretty seriously, the characters just don't.
11634	Yeah journalists are notoriously well payed.	On wads of cash that Murdoch gives them probably.
11635	Lol probably because 3n1 is so damn awesome...	So Viscus left with no words saying why?.... I mean it's okay to leave, but step down as a mod of this subreddit, and at least tell us something.
11636	DAE think Manning is being carried by CJ Anderson and is just a game manager?	Last week, Peyton Manning had his lowest completion % in 5 years. This week, he has his lowest QB rating in 6 years.
11637	Damn aimbot users...	... *Hax* ...
11638	It is the perfect addition to your 3 Thunderbolt-9s dropdeck.	So the Panther is going to be the second coming of PPC spider? But slower, no ECM, and probably a bit larger.
11639	3DPD	A real man of his waifu would recognize that 2D is the only way, and for someone to force her to become part of the 3D world is nothing short of blasphemous. Be ashamed of yourself.

11643	Ya even just another 15 minutes would be nice.	I'd also really like if HBO extended the show to an hour, so he could do 2 main stories in a week. It always feels like the half hour goes too quickly.

11647	Bro its against the law for a man to hit a woman	I've said it before, I'll say it again, regardless of race or gender, don't hit unless you're prepared to get hit. Simple. Fuck a pussy pass.

11668	Not that great.	If you had three words to describe how your life was, what would they be?
11669	Maybe you shouldnt stand in front of the group of guys in highly visible red coats, big hats, and guns then...	Sucks you're getting down voted. I agree with you. Shouting to move whilst ploughing through someone is not really a solution. Maybe before you get to them would be preferable. I'm embarrassed that I'm from the UK and have to put up with people that defend the tramplers.
11670	But now how will we ever move Dion?	Thank god, now these trade talks with the leafs can stop.
11671	I don't believe you for a second	I've seen a new Browns jersey. I've only seen one, I don't know if it's the primary home or the alternate home. I haven't seen pants or the helmet, just a jersey. It's orange. It's got Brown numbers with silver and white trim. There are two silver slivers that start at the shoulders and meet below the collar. Above those silver marks there is brown. Like Tampa Bay's shoulders but the brown stops at the sleeves. The collar is like Oregon's and is orange and brown.
11672	But le FeelS!	Wow, what a complete pile of garbage. Amazing.
11673	I'm sure he won't be corrupt at all.	And not just any state, but one of the richest states in the country. He will govern 4.6 million citizens that earn a rather decent income, and a state with a very large industry and tradition. I just hope he doesn't fuck up.

11677	Yeah, because Pao is directly censoring everybody, oh my guh	....well, it is true isnt it? Pao is pulling the strings of reddit, controls it like a marionette. or did you think they were trying to say they were like the godfather?

11683	Yeah, except for the fact that making a realistic CGI animal costs several tens of thousand dollars.	Well there it is

11688	Oh cause obviously babies fix everything	What the hell is wrong with people? I'm a member of a TTC group on Facebook. It's huge and there are always women posting absolutely ridiculous things on there that literally make me say WTF. Today though, today literally just made me face palm. One woman was talking about how her and her husband have had 5 children but sadly one died. So they currently have 4. The gist of it is she wants to trick him into a pregnancy even though he has vocally told her he is done (plus she has a multitude of health concerns combined with them both being in their 40's). She justified it though by saying she told him to get a vasectomy if he was really done, and since he hasn't yet that basically means he wants a baby - also she said he says no now, but the good news of a baby is sure to make him happy. (The fuck?) One woman said she was in the same situation, where she wants a baby and husband doesn't, but she is desperate to have another. She said "it's basically our (the woman's) decision anyway since we are the one's who mostly take care of our children" Okay. What the fuck is wrong with people. Why and how would anyone think it was okay to trick their SO into having a baby they clearly do not want? Christ. Some people should just not have children.

Anyway, most of Green Day's album titles are one word (Kerplunk, Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, Uno, Dos, Tre) so I think it could be a good idea if we used a one word title for this album. Just a thought...

11720	Yeah man, the addition of one of the best centers in the league wouldn't mean much for our team	Dwight's been out half the year and your record is almost identical without him. If he was playing you wouldn't be 19-22 from the line.

Hello, I am a swedish citizen who has high hopes of going to Australia and work/live for a longer period. Altought I have a DUI in Sweden. I got caught Drinking under Influence and was (by judge) sentenced to 50 hours of community service. No more, no less. In the criminal records is says that my drivers certificate was withdrawed for 2 years, (which has expired now). I am allowed to retake my driveres licence if I'd like in Sweden. Altough I am curious how this will affect me If I'd like to go to Australia and work/holiday. I have no intentions of driving in Australia. Just visit and maybe work for a couple of months. Thanks in advace, and sorry for any grammatical errors.
11728	Nah dude if we don't all have omega speedy pros and rolex subs you're doing something wrong	Can't say I'm a fan of the aesthetics in the slightest, but thats the point sometimes. If we all liked the same watches, itd be a boring ass world.

11736	Man how dumb would that be!	I give it a year before the next DBZ live action attempt is announced.
11737	Yeah because that will really take away all the options for weapons..	You know there been too many school shooting lately. I'm starting to think this is getting out of hand.

11745	Ofc your all toxic so need like 15 accounts each to be able to constantly have one account unbanned	NA summoners divided by EUW+EUNE+Turkey+Russia gives you a number of .36... NA/EUW+EUNE is still .45 so actualy you confuse more players with the NA date system than you favour by using it just saying
11746	No one else in the world actually works for their money, yanno!	I think if I reworded it to focus less on the kids aspect, I could definitely post it there. I wasn't sure what Etsy's rules were regarding posting private conversation excerpts. I really wish I could just post the conversations. The entitled, bitter attitude that came seething through the messages was unbelievable. She called me an asshole. Told me **she** works for her money. Threatened my feedback and said enough reports could get my shop closed down. And she even told me she paid for the shipping, so me refunding it wouldn't cost me anything (I had to math for her, and explain that the post office has her money). Luckily, I have an overwhelming amount of positive feedback so her negative didn't put a dent in anything. Her one-star review was pushed to the second page quickly, and then it was removed anyway.

11763	and that's why the banks don't have to either :)	Right. And that is the only argument that makes any sense for them to be forced to honor it. And you can't "define" mistake fare. Is $500 RT first class ok? What about $2,000 RT? At what point is an airline just cancelling bookings because the profit margins aren't quite as high as they originally thought? But I also understand it's tough to force a company to pay out a 25 million dollar mistake as well....

11769	No, it helps...	Does having a reputation for being late on deadlines hurt? First sem of grad school. I'd like to know what professors think in general of students who seem to be late for deadlines and things - does that factor into their considerations for TAs and RAs? I'm really trying to destroy those old habits and instill newer ones, but it may take until next semester to really replace my habits for better ones.

11775	What a shit roster UOL are definitely better candidates for IEM	SK Gaming announce 2015 LCS roster
11776	But why take away the fun of race-baiting and 24 hour MSM coverage?	The Ferguson case, and what I think should be taken away from it all. In my own opinion, I believe that the take-away from this whole Ferguson thing is that it needs to become mandatory that officers wear cameras. Everyone, especially the MSM, wants to make this a race issue. Facebook, twitter, and even Reddit are absolutely toxic right now with race-related comments and just complete ignorance really. When I have tried to share my thoughts about police cams though, I've been attacked (and seemingly brigaded) for thinking so. Is there any valid argument against cams? They would protect us and the officers. Not to mention that places that have implemented police cams have seen a dramatic decrease in police complaints and excessive force being used. So what's the deal with people getting worked up about cams needing to become mandatory?
11777	Any time the facts don't hurt *muh feelz*.	Since when have facts gotten in the way of social justice warriors?
11778	An asshole on reddit....don't see one of those everyday	Sometimes they rethink their actions if you call them out, sometimes they don't. Worth a try.
11779	You're a nice person, from your post history I'm glad you take so much time out of your day to post such delightful things.	No one ever goes into the military because they have a lot of options and are tops in their class.
11780	Yeah, net neutrality, piracy and bittorrent are all related.	Honestly it's probably just some idiots crusading for bittorrents or net neutrality or piracy shit. Like not that I disagree with those causes but people with actual demands that will be met don't write cartoon ransom notes.
11781	yeah but doing so on reddit is SO COOL.	I think that wearing a shirt that announces your political/religious opinions in public is an asshole thing to do. It doesn't even matter if I agree with it or not.

11790	Yes, it would.	Not trying to be an ass, but in your analogy wouldn't the "announcement" be defensible "free speech," even if a lie? I guess what I mean is, unless a contract of some kind is involved, unrestricted free speech would also protect false claims made by owners of "discussion spaces." Or maybe not... just something to consider.

11798	New Day, since they won more matches against than they lost, but still got passed over for the titles anyway	Since the Usos have already had multiple shots at the tag titles, who should face the champs at Wrestlemania? After seeing Kidd and Cesaro's Smackdown promo, could a new tag team be formed by singles wrestlers to take them on? If they decide not to throw Rusev to Cena, would they put Cena and Daniel Bryan together so that they would be for sure included at Wrestlemania? They'd be able to form Monday and have a few matches with the tag division to actually earn the shot. Not that I want to see that tag team but it'd be something different and out of the blue...

11812	My god, your verbiage is infuriating.	Social Tradecraft, better known as the Thespian Society. From the beginning of my formal education, I was aware of the subtle differences between my cohorts and myself. In my youth, I was reserved, awkward, and profane. I was however extremely resourceful. At best, I floated through social interactions, never able to blend adequately without raising suspicions. As I grew up, I slowly learned social mirroring, and subversion. Up until my junior year of high school, I was treading water. My junior year I had my eyes set on a particular female classmate. Inexperienced, I struggled to close the deal. She was a senior, and heavily involved in the Theatre at our school. I played baseball so I did not normally associate with the *artsy* crowd too often. Long story short, I ~~traded~~ settled for a date, in exchange I had to audition in the school's next production. Over the next few years, I learned Social Tradecraft through exhaustive immersion. I define **Social Tradecraft** vary broadly, including both natural and contrived methods. Theatre was a cornucopia of information, and I partook with glutinous impulse. *Acting styles, verbal cadence, no verbal cues, costume design, lighting temperatures,* everything I needed to disguise myself like a social chameleon. Improvisation had the most profound influence on my social machinations. It is a pure symbiotic relationship with those on stage, and those in the crowd. Many believe instinct is what drives you, on the contrary, preparation guides your decisions, and motions. At first all the new information was cumbersome, but I was able to hone everything at the **Forensic Competitions**. The events hosted once a month at a local high school. A single event, with multiple categories that judges scored based on formalized rules. *Humorous Interpretation, Impromptu Speaking, After Dinner Speech, Duet, Solo Improvisation, etc.* Theatre offered a turnkey experience, with hands on instruction, and third-party evaluation. In the end, those tools allowed me adapt efficiently among those I had avoided for so long. I urge anyone here struggling with *Social Norm*, find a community theatre, or acting lessons. If you thought getting what you wanted was easy, you have no idea what you can truly achieve. Anyone have a similar epiphany in high school, or in general?
11813	So after playing it, when they get out of prison.. they'll always stand up when asked 'will the..'	TIL the Eminem song "The Real Slim Shady" was used as a form of torture by the U.S. at a secret prison.
11814	I've found a house I want to buy, but my flat isn't really ready to sell yet.	Reddit, what is your 'First World Problem'?
11815	That is a sweet wedding look.	Mila Kunis Wedding Look From Jupiter Ascending
11816	I mean honestly, looking back at the picture that's just ridiculous.	Are you attempting every victory condition simultaneously? Because I see three city states that love you and no indication of any hating you, you're researching spaceship parts in 1806, you have a metric fuck-ton of culture and you clearly have the largest domain and army. I'm not questioning your skill by any means, but this is on a lower difficulty, right? I mean, I can't imagine the bots being so laughably far behind you if this is above, say, King difficulty.
11817	Yeah that's the problem, because it was a paradise before that.	And it's illegal to opt out.
11818	If I took a shot for every time I heard that excuse I'd be drunk as a motherfucker	Dude that wasn't me that time I let my cousin use reddit she wrote that not me lol
11819	Clearly the devs' bias is showing.	Which makes sense, because in vanilla the upper class is on the bottom.
11820	OP pls save ur mom	At a solid asking for munchies from my parENTs
11821	You're disgusting.	So on day 2 of GP Vegas I opened a foil Tarmogoyf in the second pod. Does the stamp make it worth anything more or less?
11822	You may just be unique in the mulitverse.	I've survived falling off a building, a car crash and a motorcycle crash.
11823	This is fucking outstanding	I took a Sunny pic for my Xmas card this year
11824	Well obviously American lives are worth 1:50 compared to other people	I'm actually tempted to post grainy early 2000s pics of 9/11 and see how Americans react. And for those saying it's not comparable, I totally agree! Total dead in 9/11: 2,996 Total Injured: 6,000 + Total casualties of the Troubles: 50,000+
11825	Good.	Apparently, you can get 3 day banned, for this.
11826	But then she woulda had $100,000 worth of zits on her face or something.	The hair and gown were amazing, she couldve done an effort and wear a beard
11827	It was	That's it. Jump with your weight shifted to the back so that your feet hit but the impact goes on you're arse/back when you land. Sure this exact question was asked a few weeks ago.
11828	I like the linesman in the background closely analyzing the goal to ascertain whether or not it's a goal, after its bulged the side netting and the back of the net... but did it cross the line?	Antonio Candreva vs Palermo

11834	its intentional and happens to everyone.	Cloaker mouse bug? Whenever a cloaker does the running jumpy ninja thing to attack me and I'm not facing it my aim gets pulled sort of kinda towards where the cloaker is. There's three problems however: 1. It doesn't always rotate in the right direction, sometimes it rotates the long way around. 2. If I try to manually aim at all it fights me. 3. IT IS ANNOYING AS FUCK. Is there a way to disable this? Is this intentional? Does anyone else actually like that this happens?

11837	oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please, etc., etc, etc...	Scott Walker Says Supporters Have Suggested Walker-Rubio 2016 Ticket
11838	Because supporting free speech means supporting the speech being spoken.	You're obsessed with fat people, that's it. I've figured it out, kinda like when someone picks on someone they like. It's weird to see someone saying, "I hate something," then posting pictures of this thing. Constantly talking about this thing, and share photos of this thing. I don't run across these sort of photos, so that probably means you're actively looking for these photos... Which only furthers my point of your obsession with fat people. Weird shit man.
11839	When summer starts, open it.	Yeah...this feels really off...I'm leaving now
11840	sounds good	Mail me a check and I'll send you some stocks. If it takes a while, just keep waiting.
11841	sooo....Hardy?	Even if Hardy was guilty and convicted of DV, it's not even in the same league as Carruth murdering a woman because she was pregnant with his child.
11842	Are you Emilia Clarke?	This one chick told me about how she was fascinated by my eyebrows. They weren't good looking just fascinating how they moved apparently. I'll take it.

11852	While we are at it let's try diablo 3 and torchlight.	LoL/Dota items youd like to be put in smite Smite has grabbed a few items from LoL and Dota respectfully but are there personal favorites from those two you'd like to see in Smite in the future? Explain the abilities and passive if any.
11853	Nothing, it was a 467 mi deadhead.	How much weight were you hauling? That's nice.
11854	It's a bit hard to get into, but games like Meridian ease the transition.	Discussion: Real-Time Strategy genre It seems to me that the only notable RTS these days is Starcraft. What do you think of the genre as a whole, and what is there to like about it? Having been a big C&amp;C3 fan myself, I'd also be keen on any opinions you have of it.
11855	Thank you I love you	For your sense of humor and anti troll, you deserve a upvote. Well played.

11858	Seriously, I'd loooove to see this thing do a quick pull.	Videos?
11859	And clearly you've watched the livestreams with the most unbiased of minds.	I've watched the livestreams. When it's not rioting/looting it's a group of lowlives talking shit to officers and then having meltdowns when the cops smirk at them.

11867	Why not give the jackdaw an ECM bonus while we're at it?	T3 Destroyer Hecate and drones? I've been thinking a bit and find it sad that we have no T3 destroyer or any high tier ship that is specifically build for drones. From what I can see in the stats page of the Hecate this could be solved fairly easy by changing the Small Hybrid turrets bonuses to Light Drones. Also, as there will be drones, we could probably reduce the High Slot count a bit and maybe put some Low? Not sure, already has 4 lows. Could be nice to have 5 of them for drone damage bonuses...

11869	I think it means it's 12:34.	It was weird to me for a while. I thought it meant something. Now it's just a common occurrence.

11874	Yea, Russia is doing great!	Let's not kid ourselves. Ranking organizations are purely political. Even the "economic" ones. I'll give you an example. S&amp;P had a AAA+/BUY rating on Lehman up until the day it collapsed. Same agency said Russia is in trouble. Polls and rankings are to form opinions, not relay them.

11883	Yeah, also don't forget that one is a grown adult and the other is a group of immature, emotion-filled kids.	I get your point, but I don't think that's an apt comparison: an explicit comedian standing on a performance stage is very different from a college student-athlete standing on the Rose Bowl trophy presentation stage wearing his school uniform. Different situations call for different degrees of due respect and class.

11898	No, tell us how you really feel.	* You guys can seem and can be "cold" to the point that it actually comes across as cruel even though I know it isn't intended that way. I usually had to hold the two INTPs close to me at an arm's length because of this. But I think it's a type compatibility thing. * You don't understand feelings really. It can be really hard for even the most mature feelers to handle. I have to explain a lot, or just resolve to "not let it bother me". It can be hard. * Extremely stubborn, which stems from said perceived intellectual superiority, which isn't always the case, people. * Can be reclusive to the point it is detrimental to your well being * Usually not a ton of motivation or direction despite the potential I should mention I do really like you guys quite a bit.
11899	Yeah, it's best if we just never believe any rape victim because they're all just lying.	It's the court of public opinion.. If someone is accused of rape their life is pretty much over no matter if they committed a crime

11902	Because everyone knows that Rainbow Road will beat songs like Blossom VIPs, because that's the only thing Au5 makes	Rainbow Road got more votes than Blossom? Interesting... Also I think that having to decide whether I liked What I've Waited For or Toothless Hawkins better was the hardest decision I've made today.

11906	But if smash DI were strong again then multi- jab combos would be useless!	This is one reason why sdi and di need to be a bit more effective. You can easily balance that out with reduced blast zones on the stage so people don't survive until 160% again.

11909	The mud is the lotus, as a Buddhist might say.	I get that. The sentiment actually came out of a heartwrenching sad kind of love more than pure unadulterated love. After an oversaturation of sad news, I felt the overwhelming desire to obliterate evil with rays of light. As my heart pumped and tears ran down my face, this was what I imagined.
11910	You do have to look out for other people, they're out to get you.	I've been there. No one helped me, even though I really needed it. You have to look out for other people.

His friends are now one friend short. Wear your fucking seat belt, people. It takes 5 seconds, literally, to possibly prevent destroying the worlds of the people who love you.

11942	Nice!	I've always been a good Santa on these. And I really hope I get a good match. My first Reddit Gifts was the Arbitrary day last year. I got Movie Theater posters of Godzilla, X-men, and two others. These are the ones that are only sent to theaters, so they're made of plastic and can be back-lit.
11943	The cheaper version has a batman themed wallpaper.	Does it have an image of Batman's face on the back?
11944	Amazing what happens when you actually change your policy in accordance with public opinion.	For Reddit, Tom Wheeler.

Was that Milwaukee game due to something happening at Lambeau, or was it one of those "special event" kind of deals?

11959	I wasn't impressed by Fingolfin challenging Morgoth so much as Fonglofin wounding Morgoth.	Well, I suppose we measure bravery by the danger involved, the disparity between someone's abilities and the challenge they're undertaking, and their mindset going into the situation. But however you measure it, it's pretty hard to top Sam, particularly from the entrance to Shelob's Lair until he finds Frodo again atop Cirith Ungol. Yes, Fingolfin fights Morgoth 1 v 1, and no doubt that's very brave, Morgoth being a Vala. But Fingolfin is an Elven King trained to battle, and more importantly he acts in a blind, suicidal rage. He challenges Morgoth with no real intent of surviving, he simply does not wish to be alive to see the final defeat of the Noldor. I think that reduces his "brave points", so to speak. Sam has no training and limited experience for adventuring or combat, and in Shelob I think he faces a foe perhaps farther beyond his might even than Morgoth was to Fingolfin. Then, when he's finished, he's all alone with no guidance and no hope, and *he goes on anyways.* He's going to try to take the ring into the very heart of Mordor, alone, without knowing they way, up against Nazgul, orcs, starvation, thirst, and exhaustion, to say nothing of the weight of the ring itself and the will of Sauron beating on him. All this for a gardener from the Shire. And then, when he realizes that Frodo is still alive, he takes on an entire orc tower, by himself, on purpose (fortunately most of them were dead, but he didn't know that going in). So considering how little he has to work with in terms of strength and how much he dares despite that, I'm going to have to vote for Sam as the bravest character.
11960	There's been a lot of discussion about how the announce team will have to, at some point, establish that he created it.	Showerthought: Casual WWE fans who are not familiar with Itami will think he took the GTS from Punk. When I was a casual fan, I didn't realize that any wrestling besides WWE Existed.. so I know for a matter of fact that not only did the GTS tease not do anything for a lot of viewers.. but when he debuts on Raw or Smackdown a chunk of the audience will actually think he took the GTS from Punk.
11961	I can work the computer, radio and soon I'm taking a report writing class with the department so I'll be able to type up the minor reports	You guys get to work the computers? Damn. I'm jealous.
11962	There were many game changing updates, the video couldn't be short	over 12 minutes = not a nutshell
11963	I half expected Japanese Zero pr0n (never thought I would use *that* word here)	I was disappointed.
11964	Geologist here, can confirm that Japan and Nepal are very far apart.	Japan is far from Nepal. These fault lines are not related.
11965	To be honest, I'd probably fuck it up	If you could have full editorial control of both of the Big Two for 5 years, what would you do? More experimental stuff? More classic crimefighting stuff? More mature, more family friendly, or more varied in tone? More or less crossovers? More or less events? I'm just interested to know how it would look if the inmates were running the asylum.
11966	If I were you, I'd worry more about buildings that had bedbugs.	Disheartened by looking at countless LA apartments I've been recently looking at apartments around the Westside. I've driven around and enjoy mid-Wilshire and West Hollywood and would like to possibly stay around the area. I've found and visited great looking apartments but after doing regular Google searches, they often return horrible reviews with horrendous stories. Most often, reviewers report COCKROACHES. I can tolerate many things but infestations is not one of them. I understand the people who have bad experiences are the ones who review the most but after more than one reviewer comments about cockroaches and other insect infestations, I think it's a viable concern. Do all LA apartments have this issue or is it just bad luck?
11967	"in thy mercy"	And the Lord spake saying.... "bless this thy AK47,and that it may blow thine infidels to tiny bits"
11968	It really feels like an attempt to flush all the unsold chips.	The aggressive prices on the fury x and fury totally makes up for the 300-series rebadge-a-thon, Pretty happy that AMD now has a very good chance of going toe-to-toe with Nvidia.
11969	I guess it was just too much truth for dem libtards to handle	I love how the first one got removed.
11970	Saying we should just l2parry and give up our havelynn is classic ableism, Shitva of the East	Disney presents: *shh do you hear it; the sound of; git gud*.
11971	OUTRAGEOUS	This is game breaking. They need to disable Kalista ASAP.
11972	I was always enjoy watching his matches, but it just kills me when he wins his matches as "Super Cena"	ADR has NO reason to bullshit and kiss Cena's ass here. Which is why I think he's being completely truthful. Even Michaels summed it up, "people chant you can't wrestle, which john obviously can." I think the issue is not with Cena's lack of ability or awkwardness in the ring. It's simply how he's booked. We've all seen Cena wrestle some incredible matches with incredible flow and chemistry. We just can't see past our own hatred of his stale, boring gimmick and booking. Fuck it, I like Cena. There. I said it.
11973	OP here, can confirm	Bad reasoning?
11974	Damn, I know the M's organization is frugal but that's pretty disappointing.	When did the Mariners stop printing and mailing tickets to season ticket holders? I got an email today saying I was welcome to print my tickets from the Ticketmaster website. Kinda disappointing, especially in the context of the cool packages other teams send to their holders.
11975	Looks realistic.	Well This is what happens when I get bored (photoshop)
11976	Steven and the Black Knight	Knights armour
11977	Thank you for the kind words and wanting to talk about this like adults	Have a nice night, dummy.
11978	When your wheel logos are on ball bearings, such that they are upright at all times, you pay no mind to the limitations placed on the peasants.	... and parked in a no parking zone
11979	Your not supposed to mention that.	If Caitlyn's DNA was mapped out, would it read XY or XX?
11980	Oreos	What is the most addictive legal substance?
11981	Dunno, man, I always have bluetooth headphones put on if I go somewhere.	Nobody watches videos except when they decide that "Now I'm going to watch a video". I didn't like loud websites in 1995, and to this day I don't. There's Spotify and Netflix for that.
11982	People cursing and yelling at me in chat about how I suck and should delete the game really helped me to refine my skills, focus, and learn.	What are some of the best resources that helped improve your gameplay? Looking for guides, videos, streams, websites that you found the most helpful in getting better at the game. Feel free to even share tips in the thread. Can be anything from general gameplay tips, map specific strategy, optimal hotkeys, etc. I was a pretty competitive LoL player and am looking to ramp up my gameplay. Thanks!
11983	Some people really need that	it was a joke...
11984	The chowke looks like a modern interpretation of 80's design.	Wharnie Wednesday
11985	tits or gtfo	I'm a she
11986	But if he did that, he'd have to admit to being human and not a robotic killing machine.	I think no matter what the circumstance, punching a kid in the face should probably trigger you to break character and make sure they're ok.
11987	So bad	"Silver noobs get good at the game" ~Gold Novas
11988	Ah, forgot to mention, i've seen patches, downloaaded them, but idk how much they helped or not really, i never had that many problems with the game to begin with	For me, on ps3, i've had the game running anywhere from 24 to at least 72 hours without a crash. GOTY edition was only problematic for me at later levels with bigger save files, but at that point it's nigh unplayable. I can do a 20 minute session, save (hopefully) and then quit or risk it freezing. But thats only at level 30, and in the areas added through DLC. i'd still suggest getting it, because when it works, it's wonderful. And still not as laggy and crash-prone as fallout NV
11989	EXPAND	My Pokemon glitch experience via chromebook:
11990	does that mean we get a road to the winter classic as well?	Hell Yea. The Wings at Coors Field!
11991	You forgot this	What would they mean? They haven't ever really blatantly lied to us.
11992	kill all the mexicans ^^^^^^^^	Trickle down effect
11993	Yea, but...we're the greatest country in the world.	After seeing all the posts about Obama's comment regarding advanced countries and mass shootings...
11994	Or OP's sis is getting a lot of dick pics...	What an odd origin story.
11995	So what we need is more families like the duggars?	My point is a significant elderly population is a burden and not a boon for Japan today and the US will experience something similar but more crippling in 20 years
11996	Found the fatty!	The only thing farcical about the term "SJW" is how much it gets casually thrown around as a replacement for "person who disagrees with me," especially on reddit.
11997	Hey, I can bench 400 lbs, so I can totally take him	None, I have no fighting skills at all. Anyone who thinks they can even beat Rorschach, go punch a wall and look yourself in the mirror.
11998	Eww :) The doctor said it was bigger than usual, so I guess I'm very potent	Your vas deferens look like the "aborted baby" "arms". Side note: I'm a total medical geek, so stuff like that doesn't gross me out at all. My favorite clinical in paramedic school was OR. It was soooooooo cool. I got to see them re-start someone's heart off of bypass on a huge plasma screen in the OR.
11999	Yea, that centos phone will be coming any day now...	Right now apple is considered the most secure. It has its flaws, but apple is pretty good about keeping shit patched. That's why it's so expensive, they stay on top of it. Android is notoriously insecure. Until we get a straight up Linux phone, with like centos (None of this ubuntu shit), apple seems to be the way to go.
12000	GOG is working on implementing that if they can just get some studios impressed with their numbers of indies sold	Movies, mostly. I'd rent them on Amazon or what have you, if only the prices were more reasonable. I can rent DVDs from Redbox for $1.50. Why not digitally? And that's when rentals are even available. I'd buy a lot more movies if I could get a DRM-free HD digital copy for $5 or even $10.
12001	Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.	So, what you are saying is no government in Canada since 1867 has been legitimate.
12002	BUT THE INDUSTRY HAS JUST STARTED GROWING UP THIS YEAR!	A comparison between the number of female characters at E3 2014 vs 2015
12003	"lest we forget" can also be interpreted as "don't let those bastard politicians drag us into another war"	Whilst we simultaneously have the politicians subtly going on about the need for war, right before signing us up to someone else's conflict. I take greater issue with the politicalisation than commercialisation tbh.
12004	OK then.	If I am going to use somebodies product I am not going to cheat them out of the benifits my page view brings.
12005	#somelivesdontmatter ....luv it	sorry to say it, but some lives don't matter, and this fuckhead was one of those
12006	NATO prefers land based options, the ones slowly creeping in on russia.	Genuinely curious if NATO or any other countries do this to Russia. Because if they don't they really should give them a dose of their own medicine. It feels like they're testing reaction times for all NATO countries and compiling the data for future use. Like a war for example.
12007	That's not a glitch, you're just that unlikable.	I got on last night for the first time in like a week, there were a ton of people, but at one point, that whole "everyone leaves the game at once" thing did happen.

12011	She doooo	Emma Watson
12012	You forgot	I understand it was sarcasm. That's why I exaggerated and made a statement that should be outrageous. The fact that we think it's reasonable probably should be a joke unto itself.
12013	Anarchy is so much more peaceful.	Police officers enforce the will of the state. Sometimes that looks peaceful.
12014	There's more than a title?	This is reddit. No one reads the article.
12015	You'd probably feel refreshed and born anew after executing him.	Life? I'd shoot him myself if it was my kid.
12016	Sounds like the avs, but they never slowed down either!	In October it was unsustainable. It's March now, one of our best players is out, and it's still going.
12017	don't see when people will stop being annoyed though It'll probably take a front page post for an employee to say "yo, lets just change this"	Valve will probably let it ride for a while longer before they make any changes. Usually they like the experiment a bit, and they make sure to give enough time for tempers to cool down if (or rather, when) people are annoyed.
12018	Why when you have that cat you can custom.	got an extra Mega Man to paint.

12021	If the things I laugh at by myself are the things I find actually funny and not just social nicety I'm not sure if I'm ok with my sense of humor.	I read that something like 90% of our laughter is done only as social nicety, without true mirth. But that this insincere laughter is still good for your psyche! Tl;dr - you should be positively insincere more often.

12032	Just put Jo at the 1...	Point guard options for the Bulls? Kirk Hinrich went down last night and I couldn't resist the thought of signing another point guard while he recovers. I know Nate Robinson is recovering from a knee injury and the Clippers may not resign him. As much as I love Nate, I think we should consider other 10 day contracts. Anyone out there we could pick up as insurance?
12033	What do you mean you don't remember every nuance to the rules in this game?	Oh right. I knew that. I need reminders sometime.
12034	M'lady doesn't like fedoras and neck beards?	To be fair that outfit looks better than what the stereotypical redditor would wear.

12036	Clearly you're in the wrong for not starting the game at lv 30.	"Get your jobs and improve or you are going to get a reputation... And not a good one." I was on my first run through a low level dungeon and was not level synced. I'd only been playing a week or two. Ass.
12037	Nailed it.	Asked for ice cream in a cup..
12038	Well, yeah; I mean, what kind of lady resists the temptation of a man who takes her to a romantic date at a McDonald's?	So do you think he actually thought that you would be like "This guy knows what a lady wants"? What a jackass.
12039	Very likely so.	Does this mean we'll be #4 in the Playoff Rankings?

12055	Well everyone will think you are a filthy casual and you will most likely be deleted from many peoples friends list for being some 31 scum	what are the cons of running as a 31 instead of a 32 in PVE when not in crota raid? All enemies not in crota will be 30 or below. What are the cons of running as a 31 with better armor perks than just running raid gear as a 32 in ROC strikes and such?

12073	You might enjoy a little known band called Limp Bizkit	They're vaslty different, but my two go-to genres are heavy metal and intense rap. I can easily go from Lamb of God, to Ludacris, to As I Lay Dying, to Eminem, to Killswitch Engage. I love the intensity and intricacy of the sound. On the flipside, if I'm looking to chill I'll hit up my soul collection. Also, satellite radio is AMAZING.

Greeen what a stud this guys is, holy shit can he play football 4. Antonio Brown, such a great consistent player, also very good on KR/PR 5. Julio Jones great reliable reciever who absolutely murdered Pat Pete 6. Jordy Nelson, he has shown his dominance in the league beating great corners such as Revis 7. Dez Bryant, still shining in an offense centered around getting Murray the ball 8. T.Y. Hilton he 2nd in yards but I ranked him at 8 because of some slight he is a little inconsistent he can have a 30yrd game and then have a 200 yard game 9. Jeremy Maclin, insane deep threat with great speed 10. Emmanuel Sanders, I hate to say it but some of his talent is because of Peyton but besides that this guy is a stud and is 4th on the receiving yards list.
12077	What does Los Angeles have anything to do with this?	Lol, okay if you live there you can say Naw-lins. I think Nu-Or-Lins is ok for people outside of LA.

12099	Fake	TIFU by losing my virginity, becoming a teenage father, and having my girlfriends father almost beat me into a coma Full disclosure: this fuckup is from about six weeks ago. Long enough to know for a fact how badly I fucked up. Anyway, my first time having sex was probably as bad as sex can be. I'm 17 (was 16 at the time) and my girlfriend is 16. We'd been going out for about three months at the time of the fuckup and we hadn't even done handjobs or fingering before. She lost her virginity very early (at 11 or 12 with her middle school boyfriend) but this was the first time it was with someone she loved, and my first time period. Anyway, about six weeks ago after school we went to my house, and she told me that her parents wouldn't be home until late. Score. We 'went for a walk' and went to her place, and started making out as soon as we got to the couch in her basement. Clothes started FLYING off- I didn't have any condoms because I wasn't expecting sex anytime soon and I really wasn't ready for what would happen. One thing lead to another and we were both completely naked, and she kind of grabbed me and moved me towards her- she looked me in the eyes and went "promise me you'll pull out, please?" Well at that point I wasn't going to say no, so I went "yes" and made my first mistake, going in unprotected. Without getting too graphic, we had fun... and she started moaning, and loudly making sex talk, and after a little while (probably about a minute, don't judge, at least I'm being honest) the basement door opened. For some reason, the shock that we were being discovered sent me over the edge. She screamed as the footsteps came down the stairs, but I was suddenly climaxing, and there was nothing I wanted more than to cum inside of her. I remember digging my nails right into her butt cheeks and finishing as deep inside her as I could. That's all I really remember until I regained consciousness. I woke up on the basement floor (with my pants up, thankfully) with my shirt being held to my face by my mom. I was super dizzy, soaked in water, and bleeding badly from my head- and my mom was above me with a horribly worried look on her face and eyes looking like she'd been crying. My dad and my girlfriends dad were looking at me from about 20 feet away, both silent with stern looks on their faces and their arms crossed. And I could hear my girlfriend upstairs in the shower, HOWLING in tears. I guess what happened was, my girlfriend's dad had a headache and didn't go out to dinner with my GF's mother and their friends as they had planned. He was upstairs in his bed when he heard his daughter's screaming sex talk, and went down to the basement. For some reason learning that we were discovered sent me over the edge and as he was coming down the stairs I ejaculated. He saw this and grabbed a piece of lumber and beat me until I was unconscious. At some point, he realized that I wasn't actually raping his daughter and he called my parents. I was out cold for about 45 minutes before them pouring water on me woke me up. I was so confused I couldn't even answer their questions, but my GF answered for me- I don't remember anything she said because she was crying so hard, but eventually I remember getting into my mom's car, still bleeding badly, with my parents absolutely livid at me. On the short drive back home, my mom, in the passenger seat, reached back and smacked me again when I managed to muster out the answer that no, my GF hadn't used birth control. That was when it all started to come together for me. And I felt the worst feeling I've ever felt in my life when I realized how badly I'd fucked up. My girlfriend later told me that as her father was coming down the stairs and I started cumming, she realized what was happening and started yelling at me to pull out. I guess I was in animal mode at that moment and I started cumming in her, and as her dad rounded the stairs and saw what was going on (after hearing his daughter screaming 'PULL OUT')- I finally did pull out- just in time for him to see my last squirt of cum go right into his daughters bellybutton. I tried to run away from him. I wasn't successful. Epilogue: I knocked her up. It could definitely be worse, but it's a pretty major screwup, the biggest of my life. My family and hers have decided that we will place our child up for adoption. I've become almost like family with her parents, and I'm surprisingly on especially good terms with her dad. Me and her have also had sex several times more, and I don't have to worry about protection now. I love her, and even if she decides to keep our child, I will do everything I can to support our decision and our family.

Sure, the bathroom will stink, but that is what they are for. Light the candle if it is someone's house. They probably have a lighter or matches under the sink. Or maybe they have some febreeze.

The amount of backlash from the public would be massive, and it would set a clear message "if you keep cutting us down, this is what will happen". Of course knowing the government, this is exactly what they want, and they would somehow blame the company for "giving up" or "folding to pressure".

Everything looks pretty good, have actually gotten compliments and such on my arms, legs, shoulders, etc. The thing that bothers me though, is that I am still terrified to take off my shirt. I don't have any abs whatsoever. But I do have love handles... I'm 165 lbs, 5ft8, and 16% bodyfat. I'm following the Leangains where i'm 20% deficit on rest days, 20% surplus on gym days. I've been doing the lean gains diet for about a month now. I am really quite meticulous with my calorie intake and measuring of my food (I prep). With a TDEE of 2300 calories, my deficit is ~1700 calories, my surplus is ~2600. I have now gone ahead and assumed my TDEE is actually a lot less than 2300 (corporate desk job) so I'm going to go off of a 2100 TDEE starting this week. Sorry for the rant, but I'm feeling rather demotivated. Does anyone have any advice? Encouraging words for this skinnyfat asshole?

12143	Just to give you an idea OP, Credit Karma shows 0 credit inquiries on my transunion report and 8 on my equifax.	I seem to be somewhat immune to hard inquiries. In the year 2014 I applied for and received 4 credit cards: * May - Chase Freedom and CapOne Quicksilver. I received 1 hard inquiry according to Credit Karma, unclear which application incurred it. * September - Chase Sapphire Preferred. No hard inquiry. * December - Amex Delta Skymiles Gold. No hard inquiry. I'm now sitting pretty at 1 hard inquiry total. Anyone know what's going on? Just curious, because everyone seems to always be scared of them and there is so much stuff in the Wiki on managing your hard inquiries. Other background info: my CK was around 710-725 when I applied for those cards. I also have 2 older cards I applied to in 2011 and 2012 which DID incur hard inquiries, that have since dropped off.

I hand measure every load, last night I was 10 rounds in when I noticed that after dumping the powder and setting the pan back on the scale it would be -.1 grains. I picked it up and put it back down and then it was .3gn. Turned it on and off made it go to -.3gn again. I pulled a round and then it was .5 over. picked that charge up and put it back down and it was -.2 under. I took everything off and the scale with from -.1 to -.9, 8, 7, 5, etc. I checked to see if something was stuck in the edges and it was clean. My table is flat and level and I didn't even brethe on it without it just displaying random numbers. No fan on in that room either.

For example, on Mirage, if CT has a great AWPer and your AWPer is not as good, they can lock down mid, leaving you with A, B, or underpass to A (which is risky anyway). Do you just accept that you can't go mid (unless you can get them into eco) or are there other ways to handle this? Also, how the hell do you convince your AWPer to stop peeking their AWP when die every time they try it?

I want to do something like: 2.5 Pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs (1/2 pound per meal) Canned black beans (not drained) Salsa Frozen Corn Seasonings My big question (other than just basic suggestions) is how much salsa I should use. I want to keep sodium relatively low, but I know if you don't put enough liquid in slow cooker meals can spoil. Also, I want to avoid just grabbing a packet of taco seasoning and throwing it in.

12237	yeah sure,we are getting naruto after releasing the new goku champion and luffy meanwhile we are at it,why not also release every chinese cartoon character has an champion too?	Can we get a new Naruto champion? Naruto ended and riot must do another homage
12238	Yeah I definitely like passing up on Tre	But we've been hitting with the draft though. So we have that going for us
12239	Check your privilege shitlord!	Fat mothers.
12240	No it's coming to jp.	Tamadra Spotted tomorrow? On puzzledragonx, under tomorrow, there's an icon for the tamadra spotted dungeon. Is that coming to NA tomorrow or something?
12241	Willam	But who are y'all favorite drag racers of all time though...? The Queens that have stayed close to your heart through the years. The Queens whose seasons you've re-watched SOLELY because their mugs graced the screen. The Queens of seasons past who remain *unforgettable* to you. (With the ACTUAL premiere a day away I've been thinking about this A LOT) Mine are **Raven, JuJu, Willam, Latrice, and Courtney Act**.
12242	hearthstone, dota, and bass.	What it your favorite hobby/thing to do in your spare time? Anything besides reddit and masturbation.
12243	This helicopter crash happened last year or maybe earlier this year iirc, so it's entirely possible this is a repost.	This definitely either happened before (and not this year either) or I'm having a serious case of deja vu about someone showing someone's dick for some reason.
12244	Legendary status	Catch Huss. How the fuck was that wide not called? That's a fucking joke
12245	It's one of those days that you just say fuck it, and go back to bed.	I guess I'll never be good at War Thunder
12246	fat curvy white women you make the rockin' world go round!	Damn you, fat "curvy" white women!
12247	ageism?	Probably because you can think like an adult.
12248	It totally does man my friend got a gjallarhorn the first time we didn't open it	I'm in agreement, just trying to correct a partially incorrect statement. Everything that isn't a weapon continues to gain damage, for instance, a 34 does 7% more damage to HM Crota per sword smash than a 33. This rarely matters, but it means that the statement "you don't do any extra damage once at or above enemy level" isn't technically correct, and I try to correct these kind of errors whenever possible. I've had carried players insist I skip the Spirit Bloom chest because they "heard it kills your chance for exotics".
12249	You read bottom-to-top?	It took me a year to read it, so maybe not...
12250	They just need to pull their bootstraps harder!	As someone who has worked in mental health and counseling, I'm pretty sure a lot of people realize that their life could be different but that it is not as easy as one might think to just make "some changes".
12251	He won't really get much time to say anything else because the host and other guests will make sure he's quit and when he does speak he'll be interrupted after the first sentence.	its a fucking disgrace and the BBC is a complete pile of wank, if i was the J4MB blokes i would stear every answer to asking why is the audience entirely female? why have they banned men etc. just use the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the ridiculous sexism
12252	Not unless you had a ratty dog, play music, sing off-key, and demand handouts (otherwise known as gutter punks).	It appears he's from Boston. o.O I sure as *fuck* wouldn't move here without a job and a place to live already lined up.
12253	creepy eyes and an oversized alien head soooo adorbz	I think I'll pass.
12254	I'm all for using the information we have but that that does not mean it is a good idea to pretend the data we have is actually reliable.	That's true but we have go by the data we have though.
12255	Definitely letting the battery heat the weed too much	Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I just got my MFLB and every time I use it, the bud ends up actually catching fire.... Am I packing too much in, or leaving the battery "engaged" for too long?
12256	We would have heard about a LOT more players being banned then.	Conspiracy - What if the banned people were the ones chosen for Raid, but things went wrong? Well y'know... Except for the people that actually hacked.
12257	Could he be effectively beat up using "self defense" as an excuse?	Yea really. Justice would have been the guy getting hauled to jail for that shit. Hell get child protective services involved since he did it in front of the kids.
12258	This specific sterotype is racist only in north america and "recently" europe and australia too (as the idea that an innocent stereotype is somehow racist is exported from NA)	The name of this restaurant in Ecuador translates to "black people food."
12259	they're afraid of black people	I mean that the rifle is designed as a killing machine. Why would anyone need that?
12260	Mortal Kombat was and is one of the best video game movies.	Mortal Komb... Oh...
12261	No, this is more like the governor of alabama criticizing obama.	I might disagree with my superiors at work often. I am not often publicly highly critical of them and their policies. That, I think, would be the difference.
12262	#WACHRBI	Game 19: Philadelphia Phillies (8-12) @ St. Louis Cardinals (12-6) **Cardinals Lineup** 1) Jay, CF .233 2) Carpenter, 3B .373 3) Holliday, LF .364 4) Adams, 1B .232 5) Peralta, SS .338 6) Heyward, RF .205 7) Molina, C .273 8) Wong, 2B .279 9) Wacha, P 1.33 ERA **Phillies Lineup** 1) Revere, LF .200 2) Herrera, CF .300 3) Utley, 2B .113 4) Francoeur, RF .200 5) Howard, 1B .197 6) Asche, 3B .306 7) Ruiz, C .260 8) Galvis, SS .344 9) Gonzalez, P 0.00 ERA
12263	I've never seen a conversation about Kim Deal in the first place.	Depends on the talent level, how sexualized the performer has been made by the industry, and style of music being played. Never seen a conversation about Kim Deal's boobs, for example, because she's awesome, hasn't been sexualized, and doesn't trot out pop music.
12264	Because that is somehow against the rules.	Call the admins we got a furry!
12265	I never understood how Rockstar can pull delaying an update for more than a year and nobody cares, but with other devs they are literally Hitler.	GTAV Updates: Online Heists Coming March 10
12266	It's more dangerous than being a police officer, even.	They tend to get paid well because it's a pretty dangerous job.
12267	How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your crust?	I won't make friends with someone if they don't eat their crust.
12268	I think his joke went over your head too	Upgrade your wings bro, it'll help keep the jokes from going over your head
12269	Who should play Shelby?	This has the potential to be an absolutely fantastic role for DiNiro. Enzo Ferarri had an incredible and dramatic life, start to finish. I can only hope they touch on his rivalry with Shelby.
12270	Too much cake?	5 Reasons Why Bitcoin Is Big 1. Bitcoin is a game changer 2. Bitcoin is a game changer 3. Bitcoin is a game changer 4. Bitcoin is a game changer 5. Bitcoin is a game changer
12271	Nope TES doesn't have numbers just letters and a subtitle.	Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
12272	Steam is such a rip off, I pay $80 for online multiplayer and get old games for free!	Always buy the bundle!
12273	The leading cause of child fucking is sexy children	That's something that a lot of us have to work past. It gets easier after the first half dozen times.
12274	This is what firehouses and the ED are for.	People should also know that if you need assistance, don't go directly to an EMS base. Once upon a time a crew would normally be there, but now they are normally a ghost-town since the crews have to post on street corners.
12275	This is going to be amazing omg	Laszlo - Closer EP Tracklist
12276	no self respecting canadian would put the sweet nectar of the gods anywhere that's not down our throats.	Did they put Timmy's in the gas tank?
12277	Defective by design.	Depends, usually its still removable, but you have to dissasemble the laptop to get to it. And some ultra thin laptops the battery is glued in. *cough* Apple *cough*
12278	Roberto Luongo's Wild Ride?	This season feels like being dragged behind a truck that's run over every single speed bump from Vancouver to Florida.
12279	nah mate, that wasnt our open platoon, that was our DIGOTV farming one ;)	Did join, can recommend!
12280	Two too many.	There's literally like two cables in this picture
12281	If you catch my drift	Time to split
12282	Well thank god I only have ~1 1/4 years left.	High school? Yeah, that's always gonna suck. Says nothing about your progress dealing with social anxiety. High school is like the jungle or prison. Social rules in that environment don't apply once you're out.
12283	If Mexicans would stay in Mexico maybe they could fix Mexico.	A lot of moms and dads and brothers and sisters are dying in Mexico at the hands of pot-funded gangs. Let's fix both problems.
12284	But but.... She's sacrificing sex for LOVE!	The thing is, you're not asexual. You're just a young girl too scared to leave her high school relationship despite massive incompatibilities. It's okay, we get that. Don't pretend this is anything else though, despite whatever you and your therapist talked about. Nobody respects a self made martyr.
12285	I cannot second this enough.	A lot of people also don't seem to realize that in like 75% of combat situations the best option when you're boosted is to just boost straight up with one then a second in a direction to cover more distance Unless you're fighting a Kraken, the up boost puts you well and truly out of harms way
12286	No, I'm pretty sure he *gained* his victory card.	He lost his v card that day
12287	Took you long enough.	I found the soccer ball of the reef!
12288	i have a black/red h440, and im in love with it	NZXT H440 vs Phanteks Enthoo Pro vs Corsair Obsidian 450D Upon building my computer, I wasn't as smart about it as I am now. Looking back, I wish I was smarter about picking out my case because the one I have now has an intake, and outtake, and **that's it.** I've narrowed down my options to the Enthoo Pro, the H440, and the Obsidian 450D. I'd appreciate any advice and opinions you guys have to share!
12289	Let me just say this: The Gimp is involved.	SJW orgies must be super fucking gross. Like you can't have hot chicks and ripped dudes because that is "thin privilege" or some shit, so your Illuminati sex orgy is all land-whales and beta-nerds. All of whom are purple-haired whites of course.
12290	It's simple: The right was right, it's all a choice, which means that we can finally create LBGTQAIXYZLMNOP-reeducation-and-containment camps so that we can pray the gay away.	Wasn't sexuality and gender not a choice only a few short years ago?
12291	Get it in Japan	If only it were possible to remove the giant LG logo on the front of the phone I'd be pretty interested.
12292	Southern Wisconsin is with you on this one.	Southern Illinois will gladly join as long as we get to starve those Chicago bastards.
12293	I don't see why not, but if that is your decision, then we will respect it.	We are sorry to inform you that Syria is a member state of the Salarian Empire, so we won't be interested in making a Levantine Nation
12294	Get a different job.	If you do this, fuck you.
12295	How can you tell this?	Most of those channels look 90* out of phase. Be wary!
12296	It's also web scale.	But now it's using nodejs. That makes it better because asynchronous IO or whatever.
12297	Stop oppressing me!	Soviet pin-up is best pin-up.
12298	Man, if you use 'who' when you should've said 'whom', it's no big deal, but when it's the other way around, it sounds really pretentious and wrong.	No one had learned you can't erase history. What is done is done. You know there has been an black America whom raises a confederate flag every day. I find the link and post later.
12299	And here we are....the only intelligent life forms in the universe.	Just to give you all a sense of scale...
12300	Sneaky also said it wasn't happening on stream a few days ago.	To be honest, I really think that he isn't replacing hai. Meteos made a april fools joke about it, and that was more than enough for this rumor to not be true, in my eyes that is. If it was a serious choice, then he wouldn't have blatantly made that joke, on twitter, as soon as the rumor came into light. It would have been more believable if he had not make that post. Everyone is automatically assuming that incarnation is joining a NA team. Why? There's still a whole other region of choices, and teams he could join.
12301	Then all risks from sex should be a serious concern and nobody should be able to get married.	No, the risk of birth defects in incestuous relationships is a serious concern if it is an actual risk in the first place.
12302	and comes with Shoot to Loot...	Nooo... I wish. its a standard blue that maxes at 294... still does decent damage.
12303	And their economy is really suffering	Just consider this might also affect you electricity bill. As nice as going green is in Germany, it's also costing a shitload of money.
12304	Uhg that looks god awful.	Curtain from a smoker's apartment after being dunked in a bathtub.
12305	......wat?	The Network (1976)- "Them Arabs are taking over our precious American Media"
12306	You're kidding, right?	Can't see SP Symbol in Abu Azmi but BJP symbol Photoshopped in all remaining pictures. So this was always about defaming hindus, and bjp and nothing to do with preventing rapes.
12307	That's true as a 575 DK i changed my first item at lvl 98 cause one quest reward got upgraded to epic when I got it so it was like 590 with multistrike xD	Seems most of my gear is going to last me until 98, and I reckon the legendary and BOA will last until 100. Pretty awesome, means I don't have to spend a lot of time on gear switching and looking like a buffoon because I can't be arsed to transmog every hour.
12308	Pressure.	Which Steam Skin Do You Use?
12309	Why Obama we all know he is a Muslim	Jesus taking away NFL players left and right. Thanks a lot Obama.
12310	because they are biased against jews	You *do* seem to know a lot about Fallacies. May I ask why direct testimony from those who ran the ovens is insufficient for you?
12311	Yeah, and he mentioned her gender too, what a jerk!	is her being Korean somehow relevant to the story?
12312	Well sharing bodywarmth works for penguins, shouldn't be a problem for drunk football fans.	I remember drinking in the afternoon sun for euro 2012 at the Brandenburg Gate with 200,000 other people. Be a bit cold in December...
12313	probably shitty resonance in your playback system...sounds great	That high note in the looped vocal track just feels like it's piercing my brain every time it comes up. I keep trying to ignore it and pay attention to the rest of the song around it, but I can't. It's regrettable because the rest of the track, and even the rest of that vocal loop is interesting. For whatever reason, that one note is just killing it for me.
12314	Damn DoD, CIA, FEMA, Scientists and hippies for their damn conspiracy against the GOP!	FEMA to deny funds to warming deniers - "Starting next year, the agency will approve disaster-preparedness funds only for states whose governors approve hazard-mitigation plans that address climate change"
12315	ITT: A bunch of alliance ninnies who want the law to be upheld.	Saw this, cracked up &amp; thought I should share
12316	That was helpful.	the question should not be if it can be done, it should be why it would be done. The 7mge is not even that great an engine. I can't think of a logical reason to pursue it.
12317	what is this?	Eastside Hockey Manager is comming back!
12318	Converting it to a gif, really makes the joke shine.	I am the human now
12319	And to think it all started with Charles Barkley	I absolutely love the reaction this is causing. The businesses pulling out, and now this. Really showing what kind of country we are turning into overall. I'm really hoping in the next decade everyone can be accepted.
12320	Yeah because "British Colonialism" brings good images in mind.	Which later frustrated the British because they missed out on this incredible source of wealth, thereby launching a successful PR campaign leading to us talking about this and not, for example, the Boer Krijg in which the UK invented concentration camps and mass civilian abuse. End rant.
12321	How dare you try to have fun!	I personally play the game to have fun. I have been having the time of my life playing on the NC. People seem to forget this is a game. Inner-Drama destroys it from the inside, not the game itself. You are all still killing NC, TR, or VS. Outfits only bring friends/people together. Many have no wish on destroying a game, they just want to have more fun.
12322	No, everyone knows it's gay to be friends with a girl	Can a girl and a boy be "best friends"?
12323	yeah 10 new routes in next THREE years, that's huge noticeable improvement	China to open more airspace for commercial flights. Hopefully this means less flight delays.
12324	Ya, the freedom market will regulate itself!	Because "freedom". Freedom to get fucked in the arse.
12325	Sorry mate, sarcasm doesn't express well.	Thats not their sole purpose
12326	He hasn't mentioned his plan; ho do you know it's unconstitutional?	The Constitutional way?
12327	Yeah, I'd totally wear one of those.	Names of shirts? The Achiever, etc
12328	Nah, he added hundreds of pointless pages where nothing happens.	Whoever wrote the novelization of those movies did a really good job.
12329	So this is what tR does when they scrim...	Funnest Thing to do in Ranked Play
12330	Liverpool are dogshit gonna get relegated amirite	Nacer Chadli has scored three more Premier League goals this season than any Liverpool player. Today's goal was his 10th in the Premier League, Raheem Sterling has 7, Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson have six. Stat tweeted by F365.
12331	More pot-stirring from AznGirlThrowaway93, who is definitely an Asian American woman and not a troll	Is sexism an Asian value?
12332	GameStop can sell you the game.	Not sure? With seeing the revel trailer im not sure how i feel about this game. I know its just 2 minuets but still. I really didn't like ghosts and AW was ok but iv'e always loved treyarch. When i saw BO2 i thought it would be crap and was completely wrong. So with what we know so far can someone sell me this game?(have played all from CoD4 onward on 360)
12333	Genetics	how do they even manage to eat this sort of stuff..
12334	And it's working out great!	Omg bio plastics actually in practice? :D It's happening?!
12335	i can't imagine all that lady tentacle rape and the boys endlessly cumming into demons is helping with people wanting to find someone to start a family with	Japan suffers lowest number of births on record as population shrinks
12336	ugh.	Creepy IRL PM. This guy chased me a block up Hollywood Boulevard to hand me this.
12337	Yes, because other forms of messaging privately has died out.	No, it isn't oxymoronic, it's a Twitter feature.
12338	Yeah, because when you have nuclear subs carrying intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads the "strength in numbers" argument is still relevant.	That is assuming when something happens in the world, all the countries that have small defense spending would come together to have one large army. Good luck with that.
12339	Look at those chemtrails	A pilot's perspective of head-on traffic
12340	Well what if you guys were secretly faze clan scouts	erh, in my old clan we gave permissions to so e younger guys and rarely had problems, mostly just a few overreactions to bad language. (Ban instead of kick)
12341	Yeah, she sure is.	Lucina is treated like a pretty pretty princess, still
12342	Read the z as "zed" Joke ruined	What's a jew's favorite letter? I don't know, but it's definitely not z!
12343	Zionists are definitely not bigots	I just think Israel might as well have all that land since they will do something more that copulate with goats and sing abu abu abu all day.
12344	There aren't even any quotes in this comment, I call bullshit	This comment is verified
12345	I hope this happens.	-cbble +cs_office
12346	we can't get enough space in the vault, but this should be easy...	Considering we can swap weapons between different characters Just make your weapons available at lvl 20 across all characters as a drop down on the character screen to save having to swap everything at the tower between character changes.
12347	How dare you question his 10" dick, high six figures salary, and brand new Maserati!	sure you are, buddy.
12348	You should become their financial advisor	They probably have only a few years left before they'll retire, makes no sense to fritter away what they may be need to live off of on a team, when getting a sponsor makes so much more financial sense.
12349	He did offer to give me all his money, so you know, I'm contemplating dating him regardless of my SO.	MRW a random guy starts hitting on me as I'm entering my apartment building and says, "I bet your boyfriend loooooves you," in a really creepy, sexual voice.
12350	But Alabama could *totally* take the Jags!	Definitely worth reading. I enjoyed his point about "Get Ready to Suck" and the huge leap in talent from college to the NFL.
12351	But...but....the Tea Party wasn't about Obama, it's about policy!	Even Republicans Love Obama's Immigration Policies: GOP voters support the executive actions in principal, but oppose them once they're linked to the president
12352	Are you sure you're not just a computer literate sea cucumber?	It's true. As an asexual male, I have never once engaged in any form of communication with a member of the opposite gender, be that through verbal or physical communication. In fact, I refuse to even make eye contact, and will thoroughly sort through someone's posting history on reddit to verify that I'm not actually responding to a woman.
12353	wrong picture [](#ksal)	Honestly, all I care about is best unit [](/#twil)
12354	No, you have to stay silent and only in the missionary position, that is the only way	Well, I don't think the OP is an asshole for laughing. I can't say that I wouldn't laugh if my partner was making weird noises during sex. At least he was open minded enough to date someone with a disability.
12355	That's cause all brown people look the same...	Different red shirt guys.
12356	yeah pretending he's actually a super hero seems like a way better idea than actually telling the kid he can be hurt by bullets because superheroes aren't real.	But the way he dealt with the situation was goddamn smart. I want to believe smart is timeless too.
12357	Pffft clearly another sockpuppet.	Now we have a big porn star on our side as well..
12358	But it's such an easy way to band together and circle-jerk a rumour so we can all have more comment karma!	Right? People are getting so upset over some rumours and speculation, lol. Even if some of this might be true, people are getting way too upset over something that hasn't even happened yet.
12359	Because Worms is such a clinically designed and graphically dependent game that it's just not even worth watching below 1080p.	Why do people care or notice about this?
12360	AdAway does need root, because it has to change a system file (the hosts file).	I prefer chrome beta and using adaway from fdroid. Not sure if you need root.
12361	It's funny, with how much reddit loves Louis CK, I wonder why I don't see this quote around more.	*"White people are always like 'Come on! It wasn't us!' Like they want black people to forget everything. Like every year, white people add 100 years to how long ago slavery was. I've heard educated white people say 'Slavery was 400 years ago!' No it very wasn't.* **It was 140 years ago. That's two 70 year old ladies living and dying back to back. That's how recently you could buy a guy.** *And it's not like slavery ended and then everything has been amazing. Like it just ended like a clean shit where you don't even have to wipe... just boom. And it's just been parades and presents ever since. [...] And by the way, white people have our own thing; stuff we went though that hurt us that we have to cope with--like when they took our slaves away! That was really hard for us... so it's pretty even."* - Louis CK
12362	Kind of like how the english word for crisis is made up of the roots "cry" and "sis", indicating how you can't count on female family members when things go wrong?	In Arabic, the word for travel (safar) is derived from the root letters, sa, fa and ra, which linguistically mean 'to expose, reveal'. The idea being when you travel with someone, you get to know them for who they really are as they will eventually reveal themselves.
12363	So... Missouri?	If Bama makes it to the SEC-CG and then we win, we get a portion of the state of Missouri of our choosing to be known as West Alabama.
12364	But don't forget to teach them that homosexuality and colored people are terrifying and the government is evil.	I believe the children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be.
12365	Do you have time to explain why you dont have time to explain why you do have time to explain why dont have pants on?	Even though I am getting tired of these jokes... I am also **not** getting tired of these jokes. I can't explain these conflicting feelings. =(
12366	Put some clothes on, kid!	You Guys Need More Fursuits In Here. :D
12367	Wonder where they got the aimpoints	Iraqi Commandos (Golden Brigade) with face masks.
12368	The employee has obviously been brainwashed by whites	I was at subway yesterday and there was a black lady standing at the door to the restroom telling the line of people there that they had to have a receipt to use the restroom. It was for customers only. (There was a large event and a lot of people wanted to use the bathroom, but paying customers couldn't get to it.) Another black woman was saying she wanted to use the bathroom and didn't care that she wasn't a paying customer. The employee told her that it wasn't happening so the woman called her a racist. They were both black.
12369	Oh isn't it wonderful living with that awkwardness?	that's how it was with my last roommates. now i'm under the impression i'm the roommate that should move, however as i said they won't tell me what their issue is so i can fix it.
12370	Yup.... clearly he died as a warrior for peace	He was extradited from the US to Israel and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Released in prisoner exchange and became minister.
12371	Seems very useful.	You can do this jump on inferno
12372	Yeah what kind of cunt single-handedly takes care of her ailing parents and begs her sibling to come have Christmas with the family because it's their father's last?	Maybe his sister shouldn't be such a cunt? Is she doing the party for herself or her father?
12373	And here I am thinking the unmarked cars are for the cop's safety so people don't mark them down on Waze and make them a target...	Despite what you may have heard, they are totally for your $afety.
12374	no I don't but they've been a better team without Love, and so far, haven't lost without Kyrie	What are the Cavs defensive rating without Kyrie and Love versus with them in the lineup? Anyone have these numbers?
12375	It's a beautiful score, even if whole sections were lifted intact from Prokofiev.	James Horner's Star Trek III score, which I think gets less attention than it deserves
12376	David Cockburn - despite facing fierce competition - must surely be the thickest ever representative elected to political office in Scotland.	Humza Yousaf MSP vs David Coburn MEP on Twitter
12377	All men must DOHVAKIIN	I hear this response in the television show all the time. What does it mean? All Men Must... Do.. Doh... Do homework?
12378	This is just the best novelty account ever.	Just jog by the hall wearing yoga pants. We will get rid of you real quick.
12379	Oh ur jelly	Jealous of what? your arrogant attitude? Or perhaps your strong, long lasting relationships? Your petty worldview maybe? Your money? Maybe, if it was yours. Maybe if you earned it. No I think I can safely say I'm not jelly, nigga.
12380	Go to youtube, type "Desert Treasure guide 2007", watch it, expect exactly that.	Starting Desert Treasure, what should I expect? ^
12381	Batman Begins	Is that from a movie? If not I want it to be.
12382	Lawrence (child) Fucking Taylor	Which former NFL player is lucky Twitter didn't exist during their playing days?
12383	...	Should Arab Spring have been condemned and people in the Middle East/North Africa not have had a right to self-determination because the spark that started it was a man who lit himself on fire because a woman insulted him?
12384	That's the happiest looking picture I've ever seen in front of the court house.	The day has come. Matt Pitt, evangelist of teenagers in a basement, goes on trial.
12385	where does one acquire this magical technology so I don't have to break my F5 key?	oh please, the pros are using a auto-refresher with an alert triggered by keyword presence or hash-value change....
12386	I had a friend like her, it really doesn't get better.	I told her to call me when she was free and less busy. Still waiting. The last line in my title is slightly misleading I now realize...
12387	Hey, don't insult the pigs :p	team parents* You...know you suck, right? I mean you MUST intrinsically have this knowledge. Leaving the lobby a fucking disaster with your massive amount of liquor cans and bottles, despite signs stating that's not allowed (they were packing up when I got there, but 2nd said they'd been partyin' it up since 7 pm and "Oh gosh, there were soooo many of them and I was soooooo busy, I just didn't know what to dooooooo!" (eyeroll) You know this is the same area where people will be eating breakfast in a few hours, not to mention maybe want to come sit down and relax beforehand? Thanks a TON for never making the first fucking effort to clean up any of your shit. Assholes. Of course, you'll all be down the second breakfast opens, destroying the lobby ONCE again because my God...are you people, or pigs? Actual pigs!? NOM NOM NOM HAVE NOT EATEN IN DAAAAYS NOM NOMSIES!!!!!!! Jesus Christ. *not referring to ALL team parents, of course. (Most! But not all.)
12388	There must be a lot of good guys with guns keeping themselves safe.	TIL If you live in Europe, you are living in the safest place at the safest time in human history. You are far more likely to kill yourself, than be harmed by someone else.
12389	I've haven't seen people go crazy over it.... Yet.	Why are yellow pikmin so important? Just curious, people are going crazy for it in relation to the Olimar amiibo and I dont get it. Im one of the uninitiated, please inform me on what this is about. Thanks.
12390	You are in a Nintendo board, and don't know what a Famicom is?	Looks good. Don't know what Famicom is though.
12391	The d looks like that Icelandic letter edh/eth	Sorry about your dyslexia, but great work. I was thinking someone should have attempted this, and here you are.
12392	Put your hands up for Detroit?	Good Job Detroit
12393	Can you imagine if that actually aired on Fathers Day?	Stannis the Daddis unconfirmed.
12394	Can we stop being douchebags and let people post things obviously geared at the sub?	Can we stop posting things that have absolutely nothing to do with the show, or its characters?
12395	The owner of the store who is also her ex manager	Who is she taking to? Her ex manager? Payroll? HR? Legal? A service like TALX?
12396	I think you just described the Mormon vision of the afterlife.	Simply put I wish to create my own utopia. I want a world unto myself where I can live in omnipitence and freedom. I dont want to be absorbed into a collective Hive mind where I am merely a cog in the machine. Im interested in iccult because it seems to be the best way to achieve my ends.

12399	Sounds good, we got a few princes that should be ready in a decade or so.	We seal it with a marige pact a couple heirs down the line.
12400	I can help you sometime.	I'm on xb1 otherwise I'd say let's do this
12401	Hummels absolutely did not have a better year than Terry.	Because Silva, Pique, Godin, and Boateng were all better than Terry. Maybe even Bonucci and Hummels tbh
12402	You don't have to be a direct victim to be aware.	I am not so sure. contrary to popular belief and reddit/youtube posting as "rampant" as these police abuses are in the world of "total population numbers" of the USA they are Miniscule in the bigger picture. IE the vast majority and I mean extreme vast majority of people have not only not had a bad encounter with police but they have had NO encounter with police in a negative light short of maybe a speeding ticket. I am not even sure if multiple generations is enough to change that false worldview of "police" sure if your black and live in the projects you know. but in our legal system. you do not count. sad but true.
12403	HAHA you got me.	I'd say north Vietnam put up a pretty good fight, the US had almost 60,000 fatal casualties, I get what you mean though, I was being a bit checky though lol
12404	Wow, that's a total coincidence given that this just became a new meme.	Mom and Dad are splitting up... Both claim the family computer is rightfully theirs and that they paid for it themselves.
12405	Work at reddit.	Wait remind us again, you do what now?
12406	My aunt lived in the DOA house for quite some time, so I was surrounded by that kind of thing when I was growing up.	My uncle got me into old punk, that was more of his scene. My mom was more like the guys in Detroit Rock City, and my uncle is like... Iggy Pop lol
12407	And your explaining the joke that he is explaining the joke about a guy who explains jokes!	You're explaining your joke about a guy who explains jokes--how very appropriate.
12408	So now the pilot has a camera in her home...	Private Drone follows, crashes into woman's car in downtown Tampa - cops let them keep it
12409	Gluten free water, though?	Something that is marked as being gluten free (like juice) means that there is no risk it was cross contaminated during processing/packaging, making it safe for people who have gluten sensitivity to eat. It's like the opposite of when you see gummy worms that have the warning label that they were made in the same factory that processes peanuts and tree nuts.
12410	Yes because Clinton administration was definitely on par with the Bush administration.	As a lifelong Democrat, I wish I could agree, but this shit went on throughout the Clinton administration, and nothing was done about it.
12411	Prison rape is just part of the punishment though, everyone knows how hilarious rape is when it happens to men!	Not counting all the rape you would receive if you go to prison... imagine getting serial raped for years while being caged for something you didnt do
12412	Saw one of these in Orleans one winter shortly before it took out someone's cat.	Snowy Owl - south of Kanata - 28 Feb 2015
12413	That doesn't work so well with the "innocent until proven guilty" concept.	Make the penalty for hit and run equal to that of causing an accident while under the influence. If you run from an accident scene, and cannot prove you had cause (in fear for your life, for example) then you are presumed to be intoxicated at the time of the accident.
12414	Fake moustaches	Guys of Reddit. What is something that girls do that they think is sexy, but really isn't?

12420	Probably not.	Contact a gm and they can help you out
12421	Gotta remind the Russians every now and then	Great video. This has been posted at least 3 times in this sub tho. Well, quality video :D
12422	Daryl and his brother have never appeared in the comics.	Ugh....this sounds bad but I've totally forgot of him and his brother in the comics. I think I'm current with comics...isn't he dead?
12423	Cool, I'm totally going to trust a report funded by the **"Friends of Israel Initiative"** over every human rights group on earth including Amnesty and Human rights Watch.	Ex-generals, diplomats absolve Israel of Gaza war crimes - Preliminary findings were released by the High Level International Military Group
12424	Yep, exactly like that, because obviously us fans would have wanted to tune in to see if the heel would get his win back.	Like when we were going to have Seth vs Roman last year, so we had Roman beat him 100% clean on the Raw before.
12425	Yep and we started planning the Grey Cup victory parade the second he beat the lowly Ottawa REDBLACKS.	Exactly! after his win last year you would have thought they were building a statue for him out front of the new stadium
12426	Is your company contractually limited to government work?	So exclusivity is what makes them a co employer? I'm a contractor for the air force, the company I work for only does work for the military, does that make me a government worker?
12427	That's my life story too	I'm a competitive CoD enthusiast who bought a PS4 to play with my friends. Needless to say I'm pretty hyped.
12428	not really, more like neogaf being neogaf... what a cesspool	so people were over reacting
12429	And he was a terrible route runner and couldny run after the catch either!	People still argue Moss couldn't run block...
12430	Ah, there it is!	AeroMobil: Flying car
12431	I think the assumption is that he's being hired to develop a new Spider-Man theme that is reminiscent of his original.	Everybody's misunderstanding the Danny Elfman thing. Danny Elfman is VERY likely composing new music for Age of Ultron. If a track was being used from a previous film, say a Spider-Man or Hulk film, he would not get a poster credit for it. The song would appear in the licensed music credits at the end. Its why you don't see "Additional Music by Ennio Morricone" on every Quentin Tarantino Poster ever. The Captain America March by Alan Silvestri was used in Winter Soldier. But only Henry Jackman is poster credited. HOWEVER It may be that Danny Elfman has composed a theme for a character we haven't seen yet. A character who will appear in a future film (Say Black Panther or Captain Marvel). It would be more likely that he would get a credit for that, because it wouldn't be licensing a pre-existing theme. Note that Doctor Strange and Ant-Man have composers that aren't Danny Elfman, so it most likely isn't them. TL,DR: If Danny Elfman's Spider-Man theme was being used, he wouldn't get a "additonal music" poster credit for Age of Ultron.

12444	not at the moment, but I will take some tonight when I throw on some warframe.	WOW. I couldn't handle that. Any pics?
12445	Nova Launcher and reddit sync for me.	Favorite launcher and favorite reddit app? I know it's a weird combination of questions, but I'm curious to know. Right now I'm using the Google Now Launcher because of the simplicity and Google Now, and I'm using Reddit News because I like the UI more than Bacon Reader, which is the only other reddit app I've really used. How about you all?
12446	Yeah, why would a *BLACK* woman want to tear down a flag that represent a group that killed americans to keep black people in slavery.	How *DARE* she stand up against a sign of an ideology that stood up against the federal government!
12447	Its a BitTorrent Sync key.	Is that an Encryption Key on The Pirate Bay Homepage?
12448	I quit cage fighting, partly because I didn't want brain damage, but mainly because most of my fans looked like the guy in the middle.	Berdoo! Reppin the I.E.

12456	You can do as Canetop mentioned and call 1-877-RB-Soccer *or* on match day you can go to the Season Ticket window and purchase extra tickets.	Quick question from new STH I bought season tickets for this season. And I have never owned any season tickets for anything before so I don't exactly know what to do. I have two tickets for me and my dad, section 126. But for the home opener I would like to bring 4 of my friends with me to the match. How do I get extra tickets? I have called the ticket rep person and they have not answered me and I'm a bit confused. Sorry if this is a dumb question. Just need a quick answer
12457	Bullshit	I was able to get it doing mlm from 30-62 mining, took 30 hours tops even with my relatively slow mining at the early levels
12458	Yes, if I ever got a downvote I'd probably kill myself.	Considering you were complaining about downvotes, you do seem to care.
12459	Wow	I am apparently in the very, very small minority who honestly prefers Grease 2 to Grease. By that, I mean I have never met anyone who agreed with me :( I wanna cool rider, dammit!
12460	What the weird looking thing under the CPU?	I have finally joined the master race my brothers!

12464	Xb1 masterrace	I think only PS4 received a patch so far.
12465	you are missing	Listen man, we need to take a multicultural look at this incident. A person's(or a group of) beliefs and most fundamental morality must be taken into consideration. And let's not forget straight Hindu male privilege and misogyny. That is the real evil we must focus on. These multicultural differences are bound to arise, we must focus on the need of the hour and not try to oppress the minority community.
12466	GTA:O has a match making system?	It would be nice if there was a better match making system where you as the host could set what you are willing to pay, and then randoms can choose whether or not they want to accept that before joining. I had one jamoke refuse to start the game unless I gave him 25%, which meant we had to quit and re-invite (20 minute process)
12467	Oh it's not mine, but I'll find more!	ITS A RPDR YOUTUBE POOP Please make more!
12468	Yeah any card shop owner would totally leave *that* binder behind.	This seems legit right guys? =P
12469	What's a fax number?	I was told to call a sales rep at work to get pricing on some units we were looking to install. I looked up the number, called, and got some weird noises and no voicemail. Told the senior engineer the number didn't work and set us back an entire day before he realized I called the fax number -_- I even had the correct number written down, but second guessed myself and glanced at the computer, saw the different number (fax number) and called it instead for some reason.
12470	She must've cut calories and her body went into starvation mode.	Good Lard that is heartbreaking. how long did this metamorphosis take? and the greater question is WHY would anyone do this to themselves?
12471	Shut up Alex you are dropped	Killa's Haters No one should hate on Killa. People say he is bad and spread rumors about roster changes about him. All he does is watch his lanes while his teammates rape people with subs. He never hurt us so why should we hurt him?
12472	Yeah our carbines suck... Buff GD-7F!	NC's Carbines So why are all of the NC's carbines horrible? Like they are awful compared to the VS and TR's. I jumped onto an alt the other day and was using the pulsar c and it is amazing. so does anyone know exactly why the NC carbines are awful? I would also like to use this post as a way for everyone to express ideas for change to the NC carbines Thanks!

12476	Capital Steeze was awesome till the CIA murdered him.	Not every rap artist is Lil Wayne. Not every rock band is pink floyd. You can't use one artists music as a basis for the genre. Did AC/DC make music as conscious as Pink Floyd? No. Does Lil Wayne make music as conscious as Kenrick Lamar? No. There's a time and place for all music. You want to party? Throw on some AC/DC or Lil Wayne. You want to vibe out and think? Spin some Pink Floyd or Kendrick Lamar. Genre's classify the sound of the music, not its message.
12477	Yea, imagine if we invented some sort of way to cover the switch... I might be crazy right now but I'm thinking something like these floating keycaps **BUT** with walls around it to create a cube'like shape that covers the switch.	While I'm not personally a fan of it (having the switch visible kills it for me), it looks really neat!
12478	Sush now, you're talking sense and that doesn't belong in an anti-politics circlejerk.	They care about getting re-elected. And attack ads saying "Sen. So-and-so voted to kick your [mother, father, grandma, college-age brother, poor family down the street] off their insurance plan" would be a *huge* bullet for the other side to fire.
12479	Your friends are surprisingly muscular.	My japanese friends came over, this is pretty much them
12480	Yes, Riot is actually tracking your account and making sure that your promos are as miserable as possible.	Promo's I Have promo's like 3 times in a row now, and always when i play promo's my team has lower rated players vs their team higher rated. their team always has hardcore mains en my team is on a losing streak i have like 43% change to win, then always but i mean always bot lane fails hard. i have a question does riot this on purpose?
12481	More like "Cheesus Christ", amirite?	CHEESE GOD DAMN IT
12482	Stay tuned!	Honestly after all the trouble with GTA 5, it'd be hard for me to buy another R* game. Especially with how slowly they are fixing these numerous problems. (If they are attempting to at all)
12483	SEC SEC SEC	Gotta account for that big 12 point inflation though. 37 big 12 PPG converts to like 14 SEC PPG.
12484	Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying	So it's OK occasionally if it's by your side then?

12495	Everyone knows every time a male to female relationship doesn't lead to sex means that she's simply leading you on, putting you in the friend-zone and only fucks aggressive meat-heads and not the kind sir you are.

12500	I believe I wrote from the beginning that I assigned these keyword to the hydra itself (body).	That would mean that `"l"` inherits `:exit all`. I think `:exit t` makes more sense for a single head than `:exit all`. There already is a `:bind` property that's inherited from the body and overridable in each head. I might add more such inheritable properties in the future, since this approach reduces the boilerplate.
12501	Maybe they should have marked the lane more clearly	Guy backs up off an on-ramp into a live lane

12503	ha this cats memes are so good hopefully 9gag reviews this movie!	Grumpy Cat got a movie - it's just as bad as you'd think
12504	Just like they deserved the low intelligence you attribute it to.	The intelligent people without wealth will ascend as far as they want to. The truly plebian who can't deserve their position. Legal egalitarianism is destructive and diluted leftism. This 'Enlightenment' principle gave birth to modern democracy and its anti-economics.
12505	I bet you believe in god too...	Saying that it didn't happen because you haven't seen any evidence us just as bad as saying it did happen without seeing any evidence.
12506	Yeah, it needs more of a GBA vibe.	Looks fake
12507	Yeah, let's keep shipping that fuel by train and truck, that's much more green and safe.	They have more power in this situation than the average American citizen. Good for them in taking a stand!
12508	Do those Wal Marts also carry larger amounts of pressure cookers?	I can't stand FB "news articles" like this. They cap out my 'dumb allowance' for the day.
12509	Who knew Bourque slowed us down?	We got to first place earlier in the season by playing like crap during the first two periods and coming back, or by asking Price to just stop every fucking shot coming our way. Now, we're actually winning games by 3-goal margins by having a great effort from start to finish. This feels a lot better. ^(And we started playing well the minute we got rid of Bourque...)

12526	Lets send this one to the Mythbusters, they can wrangle up a few hundred stray cats, and throw em in that dry dock they're always at.	It's hard to get accurate data on this kind of thing, since it's only based off of cats that are brought to a medical center. Cats that die outright or are completely uninjured/run away are unlikely to be brought to a vet.

12531	4k pacman	I think Yusuf Mehdi is full of shit
12532	Pero si lo paga el gobierno es gratis, porque ellos hacen la plata!	El gobierno nacional gasta plata en promocionar un hashtag
12533	Yeah it was pretty disturbing that someone would do that in the first place.	Damn dude, I don't know how I would react if I saw any dog with chains choking it, on my property.
12534	So do you.	Editing and grammar are not your enemies. They are tools. You need to learn to use them properly.
12535	Whales are fat people too!	Reddit bans r/whalewatching thinking its a clone of r/fatpeoplehate. It was actually a real attempt at a whale watching community and has existed for +2 years.

12537	No that's Finland, Belgium is the capital of the European Union...	What are you on about? Belgium doesn't even exist.
12538	While this is sad, and it is tragic, it should surprise nobody.	An 11-year-old Canadian Aboriginal girl with leukaemia, who stopped chemotherapy after "seeing a vision of Jesus," has died.
12539	That's a wonderful picture - the emotions, timing **and** the quality :)	My 7 month old son was sitting playing when my wife's Great Pyreneese walked up and sat beside him. One of the greatest moments that I'm thankful to have captured!

12541	Lol, it's not Russia dude, the tags were taken off...	Russia's army is massing troops and hundreds of pieces of weaponry including mobile rocket launchers, tanks and artillery at a makeshift base near the border with Ukraine, a Reuters reporter saw this week. Many of the vehicles have number plates and identifying marks removed
12542	You just weren't with the riiiiiiiiiight man	Next time Lisa starts up (because God-botherers and baby-bothering bitches like that *never* let it go), blow her mind and tell her about all the many women who have left men because the men DID want children. Tell her about the women like me who wouldn't have a baby if you paid them. Watch the smoke pour out of her ears as her smug, stupid little mind tries to compute that.
12543	Wow that's a great description	Watching them squirm reminds me of Reek from Game of Thrones. It's not easy to fight against brainwashing...
12544	I wanted someone to play minecraft with me	Porn commenters of reddit, why do you do it?
12545	Oh, I'm 90% certain they were gunning for you then or jealous of that particular girl.	I have no idea but I have gotten a lot of criticism from black and hispanic girls for going after white girls.
12546	Maybe he just unloaded his gun	Living on the edge
12547	Yup better chemtrail the shit out of his neighborhood to make sure all this publicly available information doesn't get to the public.	Perfectly summarized. That's the bit that gets me with all of these videos. 'we have all the resources in the world and can outsmart and brainwash all... Except YouTuber mcpeepants420, he's got us pegged for certain! Quick, don't take down the videos or take any sort of evasive action, that will just raise suspicion!'
12548	The movie comes out on Friday, that's why.	Anybody else noticing a sudden influx of Jurassic world stuff on Reddit?
12549	okay	Singing in the comments of Splitbreed's photo
12550	Except the Iraqi federation has Shia and Sunni tribes working together, and persecution of Sunnis has stopped in Persia.	Right - and that's what I said. Can't really divorce the political date from the religion - see IRL Iraq. :p
12551	no, they just sneak them in from Laos to sell to gangbangers	No, they just build their own GHOST GUNS
12552	Huh?	*Albit.
12553	so what do u like laugh at the guys with small dicks just cause u know their out cold and u can	"Doctor are sadists who like to play god and make lesser people scream" Yeah, that sums it up neatly. /E : Oh and : Yes, we do talk about you once you're asleep in the OR. If you going to have an operation, you will be made fun of, I guarantee it.
12554	Gotta love that clickbait.	Was there no better source than Raw Story?
12555	I thought the same thing.	Thumbnail looks like Killa
12556	That is going to take a minute to digest.	That blind people don't see black, and that they just see nothing.
12557	I would say the most privileged drive their cars to school.	Didn't you know that only the most privileged university students take public transit? The common rabble live in the sewers below the university, so they don't need transportation.
12558	No, you dirty 60s presser.	Can I join in?
12559	Yes, because I was just about to convert those people who don't recognize racism...	Now you're stereotyping white Americans in an equally offensive manner. Let's not give the opposition any ammunition.
12560	yeah make her beg you to fuck her	This is probably going to get downvoted, but just be careful because I'm not sure if its our culture now a days but RAPE gets thrown around a lot pretty easily now, so just make sure she really wants it before pushing to far.
12561	D&amp;D	What are some games you can play with just a piece of paper and a pencil? Im bored at work and can't always be on my phone. Any suggestions?
12562	I wonder if they'll ever make Miles Morales Spiderman	Well like the article said, people like to be represented. I know I was excited when I heard War Machine was going to be in Iron Man. I was Excited to see Falcon in Captain America 2. I sure as hell will be excited to see Black Panther when it comes out also. The characters themselves are great but when you can relate to them, its just a sense of happiness. I don't know how to explain it. But its just every other race is so underrepresented, its nice to see people that aren't there as just extras, first person to die, or mugger/ Criminal.
12563	Communism in motion.	Venezuelan 14 year old teen killed during San Cristobal protest
12564	Yes and not wearing protective gear would make sports safer... No airbags or abs would make the roads safer... It encourages safer driving!	That a single error causes a crash (aka Guru Meditation :) ) could be seen as a feature. It encourages good coding. In the Amiga days, you had to keep resource use down, you had to deallocate memory, and make sure you knew how pointers work. Nowadays any script kiddie can allocate a gig of ram and forget about, or go crazy and poke everywhere and he will only bring his own program down. So we have a lot of shitty software... I'm not sure that is progress...
12565	Fuck off Julian you liar.	Zack here Thanks man
12566	You could also say she has some sort of... "entitlement" to men's labor.	She deserves money, cis white men don't. It's almost like she has some sort of... you might call it "privilege?"
12567	Sperrys in particular show a lot more of the foot than other boat shoes, when you wear them with socks and trousers it shows a lot of sock, looks quite unusual.	Is that uncommon where you're from? I see that combo everyday pretty much where I'm from...
12568	IMO the PIII was one of the best chips the world has ever seen.	P4 was never a 'good' chip. The entire netburst platform was thrown out and the Core line of processors is derived from P3. P4 was an unmitigated failure. And most of the enthusiasts (myself included) jumped ship to AMD processors as the ones of that era rocked. Now the reverse has happened - Intel went back to P3 and derived from there to make Core and succeeded in making good silicon and started gaining ground again, then AMD made bulldozer which shot themselves in the foot (its good in server market - massive multitasking, but bad in enthusiast market - per core perf is poor) and so Intel has most of the high end market back.

12578	no no, it should be done like footpatrol x saucony 'Only in Soho' - because who doesn't like a $900 price tag on eBay after the release?	Every Sneaker collab should work like BAIT imo I'm just ranting for how I and I alone would like to see but hear me out. I'm just trying to show mad love to BAIT , but seriously every Boutique doing Collabs should follow suit. The fact that not only did one restock with older models and the recent Bay Pack but then a second restock of the Bay Pack and they're still available for anyone who wants some solid ASICS collab work. I just feel like shops would do so much better not just financially but attain more of a fan base too. I get that "limited" is what most sneakerheads want but again this is just a rant that I would like to see in my "perfect world". I guess this is bc I've never really finished an actual Pack let alone getting 1 shoe from a collab pack and bc of BAIT I've actually been able to do that.
12579	It's not OK to threaten rape and murder, unless it's a "feminist nutcase" then it's totally OK.	He is a feminist nutcase just like sarkeesian and her ilk. Its all about deflecting the criticism against their worldview through the victimhod card.

Are you really so butthurt about someone being in favor of the ACA that you went and scoured their post history for stuff to use against them? Well, good job, you proved that OP has a sense of humor. Got eem!

12588	$100 for a precursor orb made of....polystyrene..... Sony needs to put the crack pipe down.	PlayStation just launched an Official Gear Store with plenty of officially licensed PlayStation merchandise!
12589	Why would there be negative fees?	Hey. Its Michael from the article. On average the fees are from as low as negative 3% to +12-15%, and we are talking about btc-e exchange price. The cheapest option is always the one without a bank in the middle (cash). The most expensive would be fully automated service at the ATM. Commission also depends on the currency that you trade in. Hryvna would be more expensive, cash USD the cheapest. But trading in cash is not exactly legal, so you have to be careful. In terms of liquidity - i can get you almost any amount. I personally know a few local bitcoin millioners (in usd terms of course). And forget AML/KYC crap :)
12590	Can you download ringtones?	No. You can get pretty much the same features, definitely not more (because any "more" that is possible with jailbreak is also possible with root)

12603	Yeah, if they were sayinf "fuck the police with a rake," thats not cool.	It doesn't really rise to the level of threat unless it's specific. It's more just a vague declaration of anger.

12608	Wait, there are people who rage in coop mode?	Seriously, a week before beta came out I ran no less than 20 games and hit 2 people I'd describe as "ragers." Last night was the first time I've played since Beta. 3 games, 8 people yelling at everyone for doing anything wrong. And one of those games was in Cooperative, with the subject of their yelling admitting it was his first time playing since he got the invite.
12609	Short answer is that it results in similar amounts for slaughter and often worse conditions than the meat industry.	Quick question. You're a vegan because of environment, cruelty issues, and taste, and that's all reasonable. But consuming dairy products doesn't really fit into any of those categories. So why don't you drink milk and eat dairy products?

12621	I think the level cap 60, am I wrong?	No. Wilhelm is an enforcer, right?
12622	Oh, I was going to say the answer was that it's exactly the same as not catering a KKK meeting.	If a white person was getting married to a black person and they asked a pizza place to cater their wedding (Ignoring why anyone would have pizza at their wedding), would it be OK for them to do that? (The answer is no.)
12623	The MEA knows best, I am sure they will ride to the rescue any second now!	Fair enough, Without diving too deep into the numbers the 1/3 estimate is pretty close and often used around the district when discussing demographics. Does it generalize? Of course, but it gives you a decent idea. Immigrant is not just code for Somali. Ethiopian, Hmong and Nigerian communities exist in this district. to refine my point a bit further Teachers have kids come into the classroom with zero English and have been in country for no exaggeration weeks. I just get heated about this because no seems to want to publicly acknowledge the inherent issue about these schools. They are filled with good kids who only want an education.
12624	With all of tmartn's videos about him being 'SUPER PUMPED' about the game I'm sure a lot of the younger YouTube demographic that play call of duty will be squealing with excitement for another 7 days.	4/17 could indeed be the release date but do you think they could keep up the hype for another 7 days?
12625	but we gotta respect radical islam because it's the PC thing to do right?	'I saw ISIS playing with a severed head as if it was a football. They killed children in front of their parents': Refugees in Yarmouk reveal atrocities they have seen since Islamic State took over the camp
12626	it isn't like they can't do it, just that they're lazy, that or they just simply don't want to, it's going to keep making money no matter what so why bother putting money into it	The amount Valve has done in a year really does leave Riot with zero excuses. League will be strangled to death under the incompetence of its own creators.

12628	Generally, fewer, better-quality LEDs will leave you happier with the result.	LED Lights, does the number of LED's make a difference? Looking at LED lights there appear to be 2 main types , lots of little led's or fewer big ones. Does anyone know if one is better that the other or does it not matter? Thanks
12629	Yeah, we really should remove people's rights based on what they post on online forums.	Only because you're the kind of idiot that anecdotal evidence works on. I wish I could take away your right to vote.

12636	Cool, thanks!	I'll post a picture when I get home
12637	With a designated GPU?	Heck yea
12638	Go to reddit and post about it apparently.	What are we supposed to do about trolls in champion select? I just dodged a champ select because last pick called "top/mid or throw" and other players had already called top and mid, so he said he was going mid to throw. I didn't want to deal with it, so I dodged. Now I have a 15 minute dodge timer and the other player gets off scratch free because you cant report in champ select. Even if you did choose to play the game then you'd be stuck in a game for **at least** 20 minutes having no fun while this guy intent feeds, only until after you have the ability to report them.
12639	That is pretty funny.	For people who aren't getting the joke, tens of millions of people starved to death under Mao's poorly administered agricultural policies.

12665	Won't anyone think of the children!	Sigh. I really don't want to get into a drawn out thing about this, but going PC isn't for everyone. Cheaper? To build your own PC absolutely. For the price of an Xbox you can build a machine that blows it out of the water, no question. But for a prebuilt system including the OS, it's gets to be pretty close. Cheapest premade desktops usually start around $300, and probably would not be able to run a AAA game at that price. The bottom line is that for the *vast majority* of consumers, a console is just easier. It's simple. You buy it for the family, plug it in, and you can start gaming/watching netflix/watching TV/etc. The PC certainly has a **huge** amount of advantages for anyone who is even remotely tech-oriented. But for ease of use and simplicity? The Xbox/PS4/Wii is just simpler, easier, and more affordable for your average person who uses computers for Facebook, email, and MS word. Redditors tend to forget that we're the outliers. We're *much* more informed and tech-oriented than your average consumer. Dan, a father of four working a 9-5 job, doesn't want to buy the parts for a PC, wait for shipping, put them together, buy an OS, install the OS, install steam, hook it up to a television, find a controller, install controller drivers, find a 3rd party chat client, buy a headset, check if Civ 7 meets his system requirements, it doesn't. Upgrade his video card, wait for shipping, install the vid card, install the drivers, etc. He just wants to buy a console, plug it in, and play Halo with his kids. His Xbox One is going to last the entire console generation, and probably be fine for a couple years after. That's 10 years of gaming without any upgrades. I doubt a 10 year old PC bought at minimum specs in 2004 could support a AAA game released this year. If you disagree, *I completely understand*. PC offers a myriad of benefits that are too numerous to list. But people should also understand why others might like a console.

12670	support kunkka is great , gank value	Kunkka advice. I find it a difficult exercise to gain insight on why players get the items they do. Specifically on Kunkka because I like him alot. I have tried many builds and tried a few different styles of play, but the only one I relatively understand is Attackers glass cannon, and is the one I've had the most success with. I am interested in broadening my horizons so I would like to see if there was anyone with insightful looks into other builds. I am at work so I can't quite format well from my phone. Here's hoping it looks okay. Also I'm busy at work so if anyone has questions I can't answer often until I get home in 4ish hours. Llamaton were here

12686	How do you respond to them?	Some context: It was after a game, and I left my phone at my locker with text from my agent talking about other teams to sign with next year. Thaddeus and the other guys did not like that.
12687	He apparently told that OP a completely different story about how the boy was adopted, totally removing any of his involvement in it.	The thing is, it's not actually a lie. The kid in question is legally and emotionally his sister's son, i.e. his nephew. Some families with adopted children are extremely open about the situation. In some cases it's because it's obvious (e.g. my friend who is of Korean descent and was adopted by Norwegian parents), in other cases it's because they chose to have an open adoption. But in other families, it's a much more private thing, something that kids are told about when they're old enough to understand, but something which isn't a regular topic of discussion. I definitely wouldn't break up an otherwise great relationship over this. It's certainly fair to express that you're hurt he hid this from you, but personally I don't see it as being a lie or even as doing anything wrong.

12690	IN THIS THREAD: People who have only been playing since New Phyrexia, and people who forgot the reserve list existed.	What if Wizards made "From the Vault: Creatures" If Wizards made a creature based From the Vault, what creatures would you want to be included? Me personally I think Tarmogoyf would be a great include. As we saw with the "From the Vault: 20" the including of Jace, The Mind Sculptor helped maintain if not lower his price over time. There is no denying that many creatures need a reprint, which ones would you LOVE to see included in a product like this?
12691	It says its the final installment on the IndieDB page.	theory about "the final chapter" so as we know, FNaF 4's subtitle is "the final chapter" but is it REALLY the final game? First let's not look in-game, but in real life. Scott Cawthon has made thousands of hundreds of dollars off of the FNaF series, would he really put it down? Now, I know what you might be thinking, "but FNaF 4 might be the answer to everything we need to know" but what if it isn't? What if we're left without answers after FNaF 4? I think that there is a slim chance of a 5th game. FNaF has had one prequel so far, that being FNaF 2. And now FNaF 4, the final chapter. The last in the timeline. I might even say, "the end of the book" but in a book, you can jump around, it's confusing. seriously. I tried it once. Don't. It's as confusing as the game's lore can be. so could there be another prequel after FNaF 4? What do you think?
12692	Wow, so helpful	Advice? Stop doing it up the ass.

12709	Plus, if you don't like someone, you can insist you were catcalled and take someone to court.	Cat-calling should stop, but a law prohibiting it won't help. You need to sway the way the public views the issue. Many people don't care so much about possible legal repercussions, but care quite a bit about their public image.
12710	It depends where I'll be working after graduation (if I am working...)	Games to look Forward to this season??? I was just wondering what games you are looking forward to watching or going to in the next season for any reason. For me playing big clubs like Leeds and Boro aside from the obvious Burnley and Blackburn!
12711	I'm sorry to see your middle-high school perception of how sports are played are muddled by the real world of professional sports where you're totally fucking wrong.	That doesn't make it more classy.

12719	As a fellow reddit is fun user, I endorse this statement	I like how, at least on the reddit is fun app, this block of text falls from disorder to order, and eventually reaches some constant alignment where each line starts and ends on the same word.

12732	how dare valve takes part of the money for mods that were created with their tools and hosted on their servers	They got really low percent from sales, most was going to Bethesda/Valve. Also, mod stealing and flooding workshop with low quality mods.

12736	But...but that would take valuable screentime away from Goku!	I kinda want DBSuper to gauge the relationship between Vegeta and the other Z fighters, mainly Krillin, Piccolo and Tien. After Buu, Goku and Vegeta are friends, and I actually like that. Great character development for Vegeta. But what about the rest of the Z fighters? I know it was made clear in the cell saga that they didn't like him, and in buu it felt more "Kinda glad he's good I think" and they only put up with him because he's strong and with Bulma. But now things are so much different with him. He rushed Cell after his son was killed, blew himself up to save his Son and the rest of the Earth, helped Goku kill Kid Buu, and did the whole Bingo dance to save the Earth. Sure Vegeta isn't exactly a social person, but I feel like he deserves respect from the Z fighters. I mean, Piccolo was a bad sure to.
12737	Who knows, maybe Danielle really did need all that protection	They really were the Scarface-iest! All those guns made me side eye so hard. You live in a rich white gated neighborhood. What.
12738	Yeah, writing "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" made absolutely no impact on American literary (and later cinematic) history.	How does it feel to have wasted your lives on nothing of substance?
12739	That Oma Desala is one irresponsible bitch.	TIL that Benjamin Kyle, a man found unconscious behind the dumpster of a Burger King in 2004, is the only American citizen officially listed as missing despite his whereabouts being known. He has amnesia and doesn't remember who he is.
12740	You need to remember your	I know. I was only joking. That fact is thrown around a lot but it really just looks like a river or something from that high up.

12743	It's irony, gawd!	You complain about quality, yet the framerate of this gif is appalling.

12746	"I mean Wilson is 3-0 against Rodgers he must be better."	Wilson is a better QB than Rodgers and he doesn't get enough credit because he doesn't "fit the mold".

12748	"Crongiest" made me laugh more than anything in this thread.	My college had free HIV testing a few weeks ago. The first 100 students to come back negative received a free shirt that said "Keep Calm and Condom On," an instead of where the crown usually is, it was our mascot logo. Crongiest cringes of all things cringey.

12752	Clearly you're not allowed to have your own opinion on what is gross or creepy.	Delusional creep is convinced he isn't one. I told him to not message me anymore, didn't take it well. Started bad, then he just made it worse
12753	But but but the FCC doesn't regulate content and will never regulated content on the internet	TIL that. in the US, the "we'll be back after these messages" often seen during kid shows of the '70s, '80s, and '90s were mandated by the FCC to help children differentiate between the TV show and commercials.

Reddit I need your help - my SO just finished training with AAA and got her own office and is indescribably nervous about selling, and I want to help support her so I'm turning to you all!

12761	you must not have seen much	I still haven't found a sexier look in a woman's eyes than this
12762	Funny, I didn't realize you couldn't use the Internet to spread awareness, and that you definately can't accomplish anything through that.	Okay, speak out then, go and make a change, because at the moment you're not doing anything in this so called golden hour
12763	Fish are really yum, I am sorry this happens to you :(	I have something similar with fish. Its a sensitivity in the throat that makes it hard to swallow. Never causes breathing issues, but it's super uncomfortable. A pity, as I like fish. And before anyone says OMG THAT'S AN ALLERGY, I've been tested. Skin test was 100% negative.
12764	It clearly says optional......	This is the problem with these southern evangelical types. It's all about proselytizing and recruitment. They just can't keep the bullshit to themselves.
12765	Clearly YES, as that would make you a huge Boeing shill who shills Boeing everywhere you go.	What a fucking stupid concept. So if I become a moderator for this subreddit, but I have an NDA signed for my job with lets say Boeing, does that mean Boeing has influence on this subreddit?

12769	Its for comments like these that i avoid the	No you aren't. Know why? No one who isn't rich as fuck pays to go to Harvard. Their endowment covers costs. So STFU.
12770	Right, and your camo'd iphone is *SO* much less gay.	I ment gay as in you must be a flamboyant gay bar loiterer to have this thing in your pocket. And my day IS great (so far, BBQ and beer in 15minutes), but thanks for the wishes.
12771	That would mean some people are tiny and and petty, and that could never happen here.	I did a typo, maybe that's why. I'll fix it.

12775	They get the experience and something to put in their portfolio, really they should be paying the Eastern Market	e-mkt is a non profit so they probably did it free. keeps your employees working during slow times and you can write it off.
12776	As a thought experiment, how does your idea hold up at the bottom of the ocean?	We don't get crushed by it because we don't actually have to stand up to it. We experience the same pressure from all sides and they all cancel each other out.
12777	but it's the teacher's job to potty train muh chyld!	Food is fine, but these ham parents give them "food" i.e. twinkies and hohos because most of them are terrible parents and only know food as a reward for being "good". These are probably the same parents that think the TV is a caretaker and so are their children's teachers (to more of an extent than what is actually supposed to be).
12778	Gotta love those one-sided relationships.	No... no. I don't even think she's trying anymore. Those lyrics are the worst. 'Expect nothing from me, but give me everything and treat me like a queen. Put all my wants and needs before yours and just put up with my crazy bitch behavior. Oh but please act 100% sane yourself all the time though.' Actually the only sane line in that song is: "You got that 9 to 5, but baby so do I" - The rest is utter crap. See: "Know we'll never see your family more than mine" or what about "Just apologize; Even if I was wrong; You know I'm never wrong" and the kicker "Just apologize and maybe then I'll let you try and rock my body right" - What the actual fuck?
12779	The abunai sisters	Who has the best rack in all of fiction? I need to know for... scientific purposes
12780	Yes, let's damn some nameless consumer with more money than us rather than appreciate this lovely spectacle of engineering and cleverness.	How damned lazy and rich do you have to be before you need to take a plane to go fishing for the afternoon, rather than a boat?
12781	Sure, like who wants those useless internet points anyway, pssh...	Not for the free karma, it just looks nice
12782	Shit happens, just drive around and learn the geography if he doesn't want to teach.	FTO Okay so here's the deal. FTO kinda SUCKS. Here is your chance to ask questions and give your input without being judged. Remember that every single one of us has been the FNG. We get it, you feel like a "dumb ass" and have thoughts, questions, bitches, gripes, and concerns. Why not throw them at us cops across the world?!?
12783	Then you remember that he set torturers, including people who ordered the torture of children, free from any consequences.	I find myself liking this man more and more.
12784	One person talks shit and you blame all of us	Alright we get it, the Lakers are terrible and the Lakers fans are salty.
12785	that I can feel comfortable in public without fearing that someone will try to harass me, that I did awesome things as a person and not "that's cool that a woman could do that", that if I ever have a daughter I won't have to worry about someone treating her as if she isn't her own person, and that women will finally be taken seriously as *people* and not seen less than.	What feminism means to me. What does it mean to you?
12786	I am still really interested in this	Antelope isn't too far from me, so that probably wouldn't end up too difficult.
12787	"This is the Internet, not English class!"	Impressive SAT scores for such awful writing.
12788	No, tf2 isn't funny in the slightest	Is there anyone else who finds this game innately hilarious? I'm basically just talking about the standard gameplay. I've been watching back a few demos from today, and none of them had any 'funny' moments that you'd see uploaded to youtube, but had me in stitches half of the time. Whether it's a heavy being gibbed while eating a sandvich, or a spy butterknifing someone to death, I find myself just giggling at this game on a daily basis. I don't really play any other games, and only picked up TF2 last year, so this is probably old hat to most of you. But yeah, top lulz Valve, well done.
12789	It's a lot more than that, especially what happened in the days and years leading up to it.	People dont want to talk about those points. There will always be the "jet fuel" debate, and "bulding 7 had a tower fall on it". while all the oddities that happened leading up to the events aren't even touched. No jets in the Air, "Whats-his-face" not using his secure in the building 7 house, the terrorist drill about a plane hitting skyscrapers in new york. The highly difficult path the pentagon plane took that hit the newly renovated wing that (if i got it right) wasn't even at 100% work load. Oh well.. One can believe... Oh and hello NSA! :D
12790	But oil is organic, it's natural so is good for the environment	Just want to remind everyone this is the river Exxon Mobil spilled 50,000 gallons of oil into yesterday.
12791	Nice try, Reddit marketing team.	How old are you and what is your job?
12792	Yeah, I pity TOAA a bit	Stephen Hawking vs TOAA, because everyone loves an underdog
12793	But invaders are eeevil	You sound like someone who would spam wrath of gods.
12794	Teacher didn't let thug run amok in classroom because was too busy reminiscing the cross burning the other night	The teacher is obviously racist.
12795	Just a really forced pun, *really rare* on reddit...	That's not even a dad joke, do you people just say that after anything silly like that these days?
12796	No but robots will do all that soon!	Let's see how well society works without Welders, mechanics, plumbers. Before she realises it she'd be swimming in her own feces. The sheer arrogance is fucking staggering and quite offensive to all the hard working people in the world.
12797	Buy them a kabar.	29 days to Boot. Recruiters have worked their butts off for me. How can I thank them? i will have been visiting my RS for 15 months by the time i ship, and will have been in the DEP for 5. there were a lot of factors at play and a few waivers, another time i was almost disqualified. through their good graces and my attendance to PT and the results i have shown, they invested a lot of time and effort into me getting me in. i understand the veterans will probably just advise me to say thanks, thats what their job is. i already have done that and want to go above and beyond as they have done for me. i know two of them dip the same brand tobacco i do. was thinking of getting them a few logs. maybe some food one day or whatever. doesnt have to be big. i tried searching for other posts asking this and came up with nothing. thanks for your input in advance.
12798	Well, Lubbock might as well be in New Mexico anyways.	Sooo is Briles no longer allowed to complain that Texas specifically isn't represented in the playoff committee anymore?

12800	that's what you get when you get the lefts brightest brainwashing them in school	These notes were the best when I was in lol. My work center(Navy carrier) would just crack up. I remember we got one that said something along the lines of "Dear soldier, how many people did you kill? My dad said killing people is bad, are you bad? I hope not, okay try not to die from all the bullets" ...then we had one that showed an aircraft crashing into a ship and it said "stay safe and try not to die in a plane crash" lol...they really are morale boosters.
12801	So what you're saying is you're a pussy.	You know what I wouldn't do? Attack Russia.
12802	*That is this sub in a nutshell?	I found when I try to make a decent/helpful post usually someone picks one minor factual error in my text and gets instant karma without adding much to the conversation. This is this sub in a nutshell. I gave up trying after that.
12803	Yes, I just wrote a wall of text and forgot the punch line.	Please be joking.
12804	Nooooo, the secret service is gonna buy him DJ Sona skin after they thwart this guy's clearly well thought out assassination plan...	He may need to go to jail in your eyes but in mine you need to get a life.
12805	I understand this reference	No but it is when Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
12806	So that's why he was behind	Overstim does that to a Terran. Parting played beautifully.
12807	Yeah, shame on OP for not knowing that everyone else doesn't know the things he doesn't know.	This is the wrong place for this. There is no loop, no-one but the OP of that thread knows what's going on there.
12808	Cause le Snowden and my privacy to torrent	And why in the fuck is it in uplifting news?

12815	How does that look in IVA view?	Please tell me I'm not the first person to think of this...
12816	Yeah the movie is going for realism not trying tell a story	Eve dooms the last remnants of the human race (as far as we know) to slow starvation and death just to save her boy-toy, Wall-E. That end credit sequence where they re-build civilization? Implausible, given the state of the world we see in the first half. Earth is still 99.7% sterile and inhospitable. The Axiom did not bring enough resources to re-build the ecosphere. They returned to the earth much too soon for any natural geological or biological processes to cleanse the oceans, soil or air. And, probably all the other ships did the same thing, one at a time, and all their passengers died as well. After 700 years, the Axiom is probably the last ship to return to earth. The others did probably previously, tried to resume life, and failed. Or, perhaps a few are still on their way to look for other planets to colonize. Either way, as far as the fates of the Axiom passengers are concerned, they have as long to live as their ship-board food stores wear out. This turns out to be a good thing for Wall-E and Eve. They can go off and live undisturbed by either the Axiom robots or passengers. Wall-E will last as long as he has spare parts, and Eve will last as long as her internal reactor has fuel.
12817	Why would she pick a bitchy name like Allison?	I knew a Peter in high school. Last I heard, he changed his name to Allison and was living as a woman in Houston.
12818	But if he's immovable why would he be forced back by the Hulk's macho-ness.	He isn't supposed to be unstoppable- he's supposed to be unmoveable. Just because Shuckle can't OHKO Mega Aggron doesn't mean Mega Aggron can OHKO it back, if you're into Pokemon.
12819	I'm sure everyone in this thread would happily take a 40% pay cut and be grateful!	Well, not really. What he is saying is that there is only so much decrease of standard of living he would take to be able to successfully do his job which involves lots of networking and fundraising etc. He didn't sign on for less than that, and he's okay for getting less than he signed on for. By your argument, everyone in the Western world should take less and get taxed so that everyone in the rest of the world can make the same. If you're advocating a communist system where everyone in the world works the same and lives the same that is a different story...

12828	Plex	How do I chromecast video from my hard drive? PS3 recently broke. Decided to check out chromecast (roommate bought it some long time ago). It blew me away. Now, I just have no idea how to chromecast video from my hard drive. I looked it up and there seems to be a perennial problem of vlc chromecast. Is there another program I can use to do this?

12839	I can only speak for myself, but I saw my words and arguments being contested *more* when I had the expert tag.	I've articulated this higher up in the thread repeatedly. I despise expert tags and I think they stifle opinions that are contrary to those of the flaired user. They also create divisions on every level of the community.
12840	Definitely a Katie.	Spork?
12841	I am pretty sure lowrads meant a sample of the water, not the fish.	I feel like people would think I was an insane person if I walked up to the local community college with a fucking dead fish in a jar and asking for "testing" to be done. More so if I asked for "the city chemist." Not even sure how to handle that situation at the reception desk..."yeah so I got this dead fish in a jar here. Can you direct me to the nearest scientist for...testing. Please and thank you."

12859	lol I have a smurf account in like silver 1 on oce and you can just run around river and win doing nothin	OCE Silver/Bronze Elo Hell - I know I know, it doesn't exist, but hear me out. Bit of preface: I am a Silver 2 Viktor main but am flexible and can play at least 1 or 2 champions in every position and do "well". Every ranked I go into I open with, "hey guys, mid Viktor preferred". This particular game I go into, i open the same and our 5th pick (the classic) says "jg or feed" everyone ignores the obvious troll and continues to go about what they are doing. Bans go out. First pick, picks Gnar top (we call him Gnar), so i lock Viktor mid. Third Pick goes graves and 4th pick goes Yi jg (here it starts). 5th pick "Ok fuck this Yi" locks Khazix with clarity and clairvoyance. (we call him Kha). Kha carries on about how he is going to feed because fuck this Yi and fuck me, because i stuck up for him (I said he is pick above you, its unfortunate sometimes but you have to respect pick order) so now kha hates me and yi. Gnar pipes up and says "this yi only has games against bots" Kha rages some more. Graves about 20 seconds before games starts. "please someone dodge" I contemplated it but due to just losing two games into my S1 promos I think I feel I can't really afford to keep losing LP so I hope someone else does it. Kha and Gnar continue to rage and insult Yi. 5.4.3.2.1 we are in. Shit. Nobody dodged. I cry a single tear. Get into game, Kha starts raging all chat telling them to report yi for trolling and me for sticking up for him. I jump in all chat "hey guys, sorry for this bg, there was some issue between gnar, yi and kha so all three are now feeding, please end quick" Most of the other team put two cents in saying stuff like unlucky, will try to end fast etc etc. Game goes on, Kha and Gnar are relentlessly feeding, I'm rotating between wherever they aren't just trying to get some CS to buy some item's to help preserve MMR, not sure if it works like that but w.e. Get to about 12 minutes in and Kha and Gnar are still all out raging at almost everyone now, full on swearing and abusing everyone. I block Yi, Gnar and Kha. Some peace and quiet at last. Game lasts 17 minutes and enemy team kills nexus. Me in all chat. Hey guys sorry about crappy game, please report them and gl in next games hopefully none of you get them". Fin. Lose 16lp, not sure if that's more or less than I would of lost if I dodged but cry a single tear again anyway. Write 2 essays on the reports for Gnar and Kha hoping that somehow somewhere it makes a difference and they get some sort of ban out of it. Honestly think only a life ban will help anyone for that Kha. Now onto Elo-hell. I know it doesn't exist and chances are as long as you aren't the troll or feeder you will go up. However. I try to never blame anyone but myself in games and never ever resort to feeding/afking or just trolling, always try to close out games with my best score and try every single ranked game. However say you get one troll or afk or feeder in your game. So it's now 4v5 basically. Chances are you are going to lose. But it gets worse, I dont know if it like this at higher elo (this is the highest I have been) but in silver and definitely in bronze (last season) the attitude of players creates even more issues. One person goes afk, two more people in your group ok better ff at 20 or well fuck this I am afk as well we lose anyway gg etc etc, or in the instance of my last game one guy decides to feed, so two more jump on the bandwagon. So instead of being 4v5 it ends up being 3v5 or 2v5! So while Elo-hell doesn't exist, I feel like at least the people in these lower Elo's are most susceptible to just giving up in games or thinking well one person is doing that I am going to do it to. I know there should still be that chance aspect that you have less chance of getting the feeder than the enemy team, but all you need is one of the other four to be slightly toxic or AFK or anything else and bam, all of a sudden you are the only person left in your team who isn't carrying on in all chat or swearing in team chat or afking/feeding. Just my two cents, hopefully my next few games are better luck and I get some teammates who actually care/want to play the game the same as I do. And I feel like I will still be gold at least this season, but it's very hard sometimes. A lot harder than I feel it should be, and I get where people are coming from when they rage about elo hell etc etc because it is hard, very hard especially if you like me try every ranked game, and give 100% then get games like these that seem to chain together it can be very demoralizing and ELO hell can start to seem very real. If you got this far, grats on reading my wall of text and thanks for your attention. :) Also if anybody knows is there actually any way to know if your reports even get read? Or if there is any point at all in doing them? I've heard mixed things that there isn't any point if you are in OCE because nobody reads them, there is no OCE tribunal etc etc. Cheers for reading gl in the rift and hf.

12875	another big issue here is what about the people who leave a tip anyway, does the restaurant just take it?	I tip 20% whenever I go out, because it is easy math-wise. Say I go out and grab a $50 meal, which means a $10 tip. Say my waitress has two other tables, both of which also have $50 meals and also tip $10 each. Say all three the meals take 50 minutes, with 10 minutes clean-up in between before the next three sit down.... and order $50 dollar meals and tip 20%. this happens every hour over her 8 hour shift. 10x3x8 = $240 per night in tips Without tips at $15/hour, though, she'll only make 15x8= $120 per night. I get that not everyone tips 20%...but I figure it is a wash considering I doubt wait staff only have 3 tables at a time.... So how is this shift to $15/hour good for waiters?

As per the title, I'm dating a man whose father just died. Like yesterday. We've been seeing each other for a few weeks, on the track towards a relationship. I have not met his family. We talk all day every day. However, I'm definitely not this person's "rock." I'm not sure what level of support is appropriate here. Is there anyone here that has been in his shoes--what would have made you happy? What would have been crossing the boundaries? I know from my own experience with loss, that anything is better than silence. Obviously, silence isn't an option. But I just don't want to intrude on such a personal time. So any guidance you guys could suggest would be stupendous. Lastly, I'd talk to him about it, but it's super fresh and it's really not about me--it's about him. "Hey I know you're going through the largest loss of your life, how do you want me to treat it?" Seems like a selfish route to take. TL;DR: I'm dating a guy who's father just died yesterday. How do I appropriately go about supporting him?

Any insight as to what he may mean by this?

12940	Get a mortar and pestle, crush it, insufflate for maximum effect.	Pre workout came in and most of it was hard. Still safe? Short story is ordered a bunch of stuff on clearance for cheap. Expires in about a month but heard it was still safe. Pre workout came in. Top was normal powder but after that its basically a brick. It honestly dosent bother me, I can scrape it and I get enough to fill the scoop. Only question I have is if its still safe to consume? Cant find anything only to answer.
12941	Are you saying females talk a lot?	She's 4 months! Good eye! She is the most verbal Dane we've ever had, she moans all the time in her sleep and can't play without barking or growling. We have only had males before, so maybe it's a female thing LOL
12942	Yay for appropriation of a medical condition so that teenagers can try and feel edgy.	You've got it right. Trans people who stick to the medical definition of what it takes to be trans (namely the dysphoria) get called truscum by tumblrites who claim to be trans, make up genders (like sadself) and say dysphoria isn't required to be trans. I'd rather be truscum than fucking stupid though, so I'll take what I can get.
12943	No, not at all.	So my friend who just got an Xbox One a few weeks ago asks me this question yesterday.
12944	Me Unity	Me four.
12945	If it has a messaging feature, it's clearly for dating and flirting!	So not what LinkedIn is for.
12946	This team sucks..	Guys don't be judging
12947	cool dude we care so much about your lost loot from CLing.	The irritating problem with combat logging. Trollers can just put a bullet in you just before you log, and you get shocked to see your stuff gone the next time you click play. So that's what happened to me today. I got full utilities, M1014 with 4 mags, Uzi with 5 mags, Survival pack, 3 blood bags, 2 painkillers, 2 MRE's, 1 coke and 1 susat scope. And what's really annoying is that I spent more that 3 hours getting that shit.
12948	Anything to bring down the Chinese	TIL In Japan, KFC fast food is a Christmas tradition
12949	Well, they have to all be converted to the metric system, which takes quite a bit of time.	I can literally not think of a single thing that has less reason to be tied to location than generating an equally-weighted random number between 1 and 6.
12950	Think of the magic seeds...hnggggg	Thats a fuck ton of nests
12951	Everyone knows that rail is safer.	Yay! Lets just continue to ship oil by rail. That's a lot better for the environment and infinity times safer, right?
12952	If they've already gone that far, I think they should add some LED backlight for the logo.	I hate that. Monoprice seems to do this with their iPhone cases. They're cheap but "good enough", yet most of them have *hideous* "windows" on the back that show off the Apple logo. Is it trying to make the phone some status symbol? In a $4 case? Strangely, despite having a gaping and unnecessary hole for the Apple logo, a lot of these cases have a hole that is *too small* for important things like the mute switch, charging cable, or headphone jack.
12953	Sounds more like today you fucked up by bathing in your own jizz.	TIFU by feeding my cat my semen. Not using a throwaway because whatever. I'll own up to it. Two mornings ago I woke up earlier than usual, and with that extra time came the simultaneous need to relax and to be stimulated. I figured that masturbating in a nice hot bath would take care of that. So, I'm sitting in the tub with images of boobies and booties floating around in my imagination, and before long the inevitable happens. Pop. For those who don't know, when semen meets water it turns into a really cool stringy substance that looks exactly like the stuff Spider Man shoots out of his wrists. I finished up the bath and pulled the plug, expecting my love-web to start gently floating down the drain like dandelion seeds on a spring breeze. As I opened the door, I was met by my cat, who often likes to hang out in the bathroom with me. "No problem," I thought, as I did other bathroom activities like brushing my teeth and getting changed. That's when I heard it. *lick lick lick* "What the hell?" **licklicklicklicklicklicklick** To my horror, I discovered that some of my love-web had not made its way down the drain, but came to rest at the bottom of the tub. And right before my eyes, my cat was also in the tub - licking it up with rabid intensity. I yelled something unintelligible and lifted her out of the tub. Within half an hour she was puking all over the house, which continued sporadically for the rest of the day. The past two mornings I've woken up with her in my bed. She looks at me and purrs. It makes me uncomfortable.
12954	Sweet I didn't know that.	So you just want all the audio guys at Bungie to sit on their thumbs until every single bug is fixed? Not everyone there is a programmer or tester.
12955	Yeah, because if you have money, who needs love or companionship?	I never get what she married in the first place, she had her own money!
12956	If made deep in china, all that extra fabric could have literally cost tens of dollars...	This, alone, probably made the whole thing cost some 5-10-k more. Weddings are crazy expensive.
12957	Is deoxys the person with that glorious sparkling hound pet?	He is active, although I think hes playing something else at the moment. He is actually the person I've known the longest in PoE. Hes a very cool understated guy, and I really hope someday he takes pity on me and gives me a code for his amazing pet. The first time I saw it in person I think I drooled a bit.
12958	Omg one person downvoted might as well delete the post	you can reverse your stupidity by removing this post. also, downvoted.
12959	They probably realized no one wanted to watch old gameplay of Ghosts anyway.	So... UMG Nashville VODS... anyone know what happened to them? It's been nearly two months now since they started uploading videos and they still aren't all up. They seem to have stopped uploading them 3 weeks ago, what gives? Anyone know?
12960	Because it's factory new duh	On an unrelated note you just made me realize after all those years why the FN Five-seveN has the capital N at the end. My mind is indeed blown.
12961	This thing is still bs at its br but hey it's the dev server and things will change!	But the Banshee's acceleration is absolutely terrible. Worse than a stock F-86F, but not as bad as the F-84B. And it should be using the Colt Mk 16's instead of the AN/M3.
12962	Well, maybe he posted it here first and then to the youtube comments	This was taken from the youtube comments word for word ;_;
12963	yes lets escalate the entire situation, thats not likely to make it worse or anything	Black people thought that they were being mistreated before. Good luck after this incident.
12964	Shhh... don't you know that a fat person is just "a fat" and not an actual person?	"YES I am FAT" This always irks me. No, you are not fat. You are not your fat. It is not even YOUR fat, it is the fat that has collected in your body. Stop making it your identity. You are a person who has extra fat in their body. STOP EQUATING YOURSELF AS THE FAT!! Then maybe you will see it for what it is, and not see it as you are losing parts of yourself.
12965	but just look at how many people are reporting the same thing!	Well, I just wasted 15 minutes or so, browsing some of those. All either message boards or other B4IN type shit sites. As expected.
12966	Nah man, jet fuel can melt steel beams!	Hahaha stop you're trying too hard
12967	STOP BEING SO LOGICAL!	Idk what your gender has to do with it or where you got that from my post, but why don't we both go ahead and drop this too. Agree 2 disagree. OP can take the advice that makes the most sense to her.

12973	Both teams are dirty guys, everyone diving for the ball	Eastern Conference Finals, Game 3 (DO IT FOR LOVE edition), Atlanta Hawks (0-2) @ Cleveland Cavaliers (2-0), 5/24/2015, 8:30 PM E.T. on TNT - Kyrie Irving will not be playing tonight. - Kevin Love is in the building, for those who are interested. - Kyle Korver is out for the rest of the playoffs with an ankle injury.
12974	Sometimes it gives doubting believers the courage to examine their beliefs more critically.	I'm not saying I don't find them funny in some cases, but I feel like very often they are made just to bring other people down. Why is that okay?

12980	Come on, that Lopez flip shot is unguardable	We are not anywhere near a top 10 defense when Al is in his current state. He was fine offensively, but just like Gasol the other night, Lopez found himself wide open if he was more than 5 feet from the basket. Al is depressingly terrible defensively when he plays hurt.
12981	You mean, "The History of the Yankees, Red Sox, and Dodgers"?	You guys are fooling yourself if you don't watch Ken Burns' Baseball
12982	N	U
12983	Hence the undeniable logic that you should do a chest week for every leg day.	Legs are probably the fastest thing to grow. Then I'd say back. So easy to target these muscle groups with high volume work. Before anyone says chest -- chest can do high volume but not nearly as high as back/legs. Your chest may grow quickly, but that's probably because you're only doing chest -.-
12984	Violence is okay only when I do it!	Yep. Hit a nerve with her mentally, so she had to do it physically :)

12994	Yes, this movie is exactly like transformers and expendables.	People were told to think that before they ever saw it. Producers paid the critics to talk it up, and seeing as how the general population are a bunch of spit drooling mouth breathers, it worked.
12995	My wife and I sent invitations to people we knew wouldn't come because they would have been offended if we didn't.	While I would never do what this person did, I have to admit to being annoyed at getting invitations to out-of-town weddings, graduations, etc., when they know we won't be coming. (I'm older than almost all of you, so the potential party aspect probably isn't as appealing to me either.) I look at these as "invitations to send an obligatory gift."
12996	Or just don't buy anything like that in the first place and live a normal life.	Yes, it's far better to buy things off the street. Because you always know exactly what you're getting.

13006	wait, i guess?	American super interested in the Ultimate Player Edition (1Tb model), what are my options? Okay so first and foremost, I'm not that interested in upgrading the hard drive because I prefer the stock hard drive speeds, and I kinda like that I don't have to pay extra for more storage. I'm MOSTLY curious in the region-locking aspect of PS4. If I got this European model, would I be okay with playing American discs? I think I read online that DVD and Blu-rays wouldn't be compatible... is this true? I didn't know movies were region locked. But I guess all of this would be avoided if the model was to come stateside. Is there a high possibility of this happening?

He was absolutely right. I never really realized this until I took an anthropology class and our professor outright made the claim that, throughout history, religions spring up as a support structure to keep social stratification from collapsing - i.e. the people on bottom rebelling against the people on the top.

13045	(Possible S1 spoilers) Especially with her seeing a doctor about fertility later in the season, even though it was just a feint to trap her pregnant employee in a catch-22, I though there was still some symbolism about how she really does want a child (including sleeping with that photographer guy, so she has somewhat of a wild side and another type of life she wishes she could have had), but sacrifices that dream because she wants her husband to succeed	Clair and the Graveyard So I was wondering while re-watching S1 what is the symbolism or significance of the graveyard that Claire gets yelled at for running through? It seems like something that deeply sends ripples through her, yet for the life of me I could not understand the significance. (For those wondering S1 E3) Does this have something to do with her firing all of those people and maybe her feeling guilt for the "death" of their careers? I dunno just grasping for straws here. Someone please help!!!
13046	Yeah, and we know women NEVER complain about that.	Which is fine as long as those folks don't ever complain about that nobody approaching them or the men they want to approach don't do it.
13047	The padding here should be at the edges of the signal - oversampling the Fourier response - not the time domain (at least based on how I read it).	Why does padding with zeroes in between samples in the time domain not change the frequency content of the signal?

13069	This is a very good way to look at it, OP.	It's not unnecessary, the amount of threads labeled *spoilers all*. Think of it as someone stamping their thread with just how far through the series they are. One who has read the entire series and related material isn't going to limit a discussion they're taking part in to appease another reader that probably can't add much to the discussion yet.

13072	Yeah it's pretty commonplace really!	Everyone is always screaming fake or not fake. I've seen and done plenty of strange things, and I don't see why most stories, this one included, simply must be fake. Any single part of this story is believable and the thing together is just moderately unfortunate luck stringing together. I don't know if it's y'all's life or Netflix or if everyone I know is just crazy, but besides the hyperbole of 1000 condoms, this story didn't even strike me as particularly odd.

13125	Yeah, shit like the Marine Corps War Memorial doesn't glorify war at all.	That really is not the purpose of war memorials. They provide closure and a place for mourners to connect with those they lost. It has more to do with the grieving process than any propaganda effort. To say something like that really just demonstrates a lot of ignorance, and clearly shows you've never lost someone close to you from war. It may seem that way to you, looking in from the outside, but to those of us who have lost people in war then visiting a memorial is similar to visiting a grave or such that allows you to feel close to that person one more time. It also serves as a reminder of the cost of war, and how people sometimes give everything they have so that others can sit behind a keyboard and misinterpret the purpose of war memorials.

I want to get vr3 before moving on but ive hit all the quest hubs, done all the delves even got all the lore books. The only thing i havent done is all the dolmens and group dungeons I'm guessing I need to grind out the rest of this level. Anyone offer any advice on how to go about it? I did try questing in cyrodil but it can be a bit painful running so far even with the pvp speed buff on. Should i just be finding a spot with quick spawning vr2 mobs and kill them all day?

13131	If you read the article you would see that things back then were not as bad as you are describing, and from a creators point of view, sometimes things were much better back then than they are now.	To be fair, I find it a bit hard to take indie devs complaining about steam seriously because it seems like they aren't thinking about life before steam. Before steam a market for indie games didn't exist outside of the occasional outlier; people just didn't really know about them. Now there is this big market for indie games (which steam helped create) and devs are complaining about competition, but without steam there would likely not be as much competition OR a big market for their games.

A girl wanted to take a picture with the car and walked over thinking the side exhaust was a platform thing ( like on trucks ) and rested her foot on it. The exhaust was so hot, it melted the sole of her shoe onto the exhaust. Cue my cousin looking like you just stabbed his family. Haha.

13187	Bro that 88mm anti-aircraft gun from the hip is the best	I'm a gun enthusiast and collector, I own about 30+ guns and I am a minor expert on them. I know guns at least as well as I know law, which is my day job. There are too many to count (unlimited bullets, perfect accuracy, etc.) but I don't mind many of them since they add to the fun. There are two in particular I can't stand: 1.) In *every* TV show and movie *ever*, when someone points a Glock or similar striker-fired pistol at a bad guy and you hear a cocking noise or a slide racking noise. First, every professional keeps a round chambered, including probably 99.9% of police and agents. If someone is racking their slide just then, they're either bad at their job or just ejected one of their rounds onto the ground. Second, Glocks do not have hammers! The striker is a little pin on a plunger, basically, inside the gun. It doesn't make a cocking noise, it cocks by the recoil action of the gun (and on partially cocked striker systems like the Glock, a little bit by the trigger upon firing). That cocking noise *cannot possibly happen*. 2.) When they use incorrect terminology that a Google search could clear up. News media is also really bad about that. Things like calling a .40 S&amp;W a "40mm", which would be a freaking anti-aircraft gun. Do your research.

13202	I concur...	TBH, I think its alot of practical effects enhanced with some 3D rather than the other way around. Sure, its tonnes of tracking and some siiiiick compositing, but the 3D stuff doesnt seem extra intense. Its really well lit, and textured, but cause its so heavily composited, a good compositor could probably blend in any 3D elements that looked off.... The only reason I think its more heavy compositing than 3d is because the figures never really move all that much. once you get the track down, manipulating the figures is *alot* easier, because they don't really move relative to the track. so a good AE/nuke artist I feel could really go to town on those figures with a little 3d... I mean some parts are clearly 3D, like around that 2:20 mark... but yeah. But hey... What do I know?! Im no professional. I dunno what the hell I'm talking about. XD

13205	but guys it was a conspiracy to help Duke win	From the view of a Replay Operator: Why the end of game blunder is on the TV broadcast, not the refs. Much of the outrage for how the referees made their decision was extremely unfortunate because they approached the announcers saying "there wasn't enough to tell" directly after the audience was shown the zoomed in shot of the finger touching the ball. I saw it, everyone saw it. But before the last 2 shots, where we finally saw middle fingertip touch the ball, nobody could have been sure. I can say with 99% certainty that the officials never saw this shot, and here's why: The refs have their own dedicated play back system for official reviews. Their machine can rewind and fast forward the "program" angle of the TV broadcast. This means that they cannot rewind and do not have control of individual cameras. It is basically like someone taping the show and then being able to rewind and play it back at any speed you want. So, when the refs took this under review, they were rewinding and looking at earlier replays. Sure, they were the same angles, but with such a close call it took seeing it dozens of times and playing it back at incredibly slow speeds and zooming in on 4K cameras to see it. There is almost zero chance that the refs were looking at the same thing the audience was when the decision was made. Now if you want to say that they should have looked at it longer, then yeah, you could blame it one the refs. But, they have a job to move the game along and not take forever reviewing. It is my opinion that they did their due diligence on looking at the replays that were shown at first, but it is on the producers and replay operators to find the definitive look as quickly as possible. It is obvious that it did not happen. I don't have an official count of it, but it felt like they showed it about 20 times on about 12 different angles. That is simply too long. Now, don't get me wrong, they were far from fucking up. That was a needle in a haystack and in the end, they found it, and the replay operator who was able to find it was probably thinking he just had the greatest moment in his career, helping to decide a Final Four game. But I just feel bad for the refs because they didn't get to see it in time. There is my rant. I feel bad for the refs because everybody thinks they made the decision directly after seeing the shot that was clearly showing that it was off Duke. Simply wasn't the case, because believe it or not, these guys know what they are doing and I know that as soon as they get shown that zoomed in view, they are going to be sick to their stomachs.

13222	So true, savings $10 on a tank of gas makes me want to just get out of the house and drive around the city for fun....	I predict low fuel prices will make congestion worse. Gas needs to be taxed more.

13227	We need more things to be thankful for the next year	Black Friday. I hate that it's been brought over to the UK. Why on Earth would you fight people over cheap rubbish right after you've just celebrated Thanksgiving?
13228	i think the Supreme Court will rule that to properly implement ACA, it needs to be single payer.	The shitshow that became Obamacare is the reason we're dealing with all this political backlash. Say what you will about the ACA being helpful and "putting consumers back in charge," but it's all hogwash. You don't give consumers power when you legally require them to buy something or face strict punishments. Obamacare went from the socialized care it should have been, to a health insurance company's wet dream of guaranteed and increased profits with absolutely no extra work required. Insurance companies should have been completely decommissioned and replaced with a governmental agency and a slight increase in everyone's taxes, and a sharp increase in tobacco and alcohol costs. Since that would have murdered about three different industries, we instead have mandatory health *insurance* (not actual healthcare), and it's going to end up costing more because you have forced a captive customer base in the insurance market.
13229	Yea but I'd rather save that one keypress and type bae instead of babe.	bae is supposed to stand for "before anything else". I hate myself for knowing that but I hope I helped you in some way
13230	Uuuuh, It's called "The Emperor's New Groove"	Wasn't that the moral of *The Emperor's New Clothes*? Do people even read stuff like that to their kids any more?
13231	You're not wrong, you're just an ass.	omg, are you like dense? Thanks for stating the obvious that dota is a team game. But that wasn't the point, grandpa If a player is inherently bad and only seemingly achieves good results every game because of his team pushing him up, does that make him a *good* player instead of an actual hidden liability? No. Does that mean the team would be better off with a better player? probably yes. There are good carries and there are bad carries, thats a fact whether you like it or not

13235	The Master System is already a console product though, under what alternative banner should we boast superiority over the console plebs.	I think the best way to put it, especially given the thread, is that the distribution of gamer-whininess is equivalent among all consoles without exception to pc gamers.
13236	Yeah, he definitely deserved decapitation via booby-trap.	Seems like if the kid rode his dirt bike on his own property all of this would've been avoided. I don't see this one way.

13260	Then they would bitch about us winning in such a cheap way	Wouldn't it be a technical if you call a timeout when you have none? It would be so funny if the refs awarded a technical free throw for that.
13261	Maybe it's his way of saying that he's not having a hard day.	I've posted a couple creepy pms today, didn't realise I'd be getting so many in such a short amount of time. But this... Just, why!? Although I'm surprised he didn't go with the 10inches.
13262	Valdez.	Where are you vacationing?
13263	Karma whoring for t-shirts will definitely get the s/n ratio up on the default subs.	Can easily happen as long as it has absolutely nothing to do with equity, which it apparently won't. Sounds a lot like it's going to be tradable karma that's redeemable in reddit store.

13267	I really like Water Balloon and the last one.	Apparently instead of sleeping, I also thought up new items. Passive Set of 3, do the same thing - Evil Up, Increase Black Hearts - Damage Effects from Necronomicon, Black Heart Popping, The Negative multiplied by 3 (Up to 3 times) Active: Sprinkler - Oscillate tears from the top of your head for 5 seconds Active - Water Balloon - Places a decoy that pops after 3 hits or 10 seconds, leaving damaging water creep and shoots a ring of tears. Attacking the balloon as isaac does not count as damage, instead increases the damage of those tears. Passive - Standing still and firing tears dramatically increases tears rate Passive - Killing a champion mob or monster permamently increases tears or damage by a small amount. Passive - Isaac can now kill rocks with tears. In addition, does damage to invincible enemies. Active - Converts one soul heart to a black heart. Passive - Speed Down. Contact Damage. Active - Place a contact tear on the ground that can be moved by walking into it. Tear grows in size and damage by absorbing Isaac's tears.

13269	*Vol'jin* not Zol'jin	Zol'Jin and Garrosh Just started working my way into the Troll campaign, Zol'Jin and Garrosh obviously don't get along, and basically *hate* each other. Does this mean Trolls/Orcs are two "seperate" factions? I get that they are all part of the Horde, but it seems to me as Zol'Jin is trying to isolate the Troll life to themselves in order to keep peace amongst themselves, and **KEEP** a place for them to call home? I understand once I hit Orgrimmar then Garrosh becomes my Warchief, but is there any other parts where Zol'Jin comes in? Sorry, I seemed to have overslept and skipped 1st hour Lore Class.
13270	If it makes you feel better, you didn't overpay him and he's going to Cooperstown in a Cards hat.	It's been nearly a decade and I'm still bitter he didn't win the MVP in 2006. Fucking Ryan Howard got it based solely on the fact that he hit 58 dingers and Albert "only" hit 49. Still an elite season by Howard, but Albert out produced him by two full WAR! I miss him so much sometimes.

13280	:D	D:
13281	How do you manage life?	I guess I'm never gonna see a movie again... Since when I joined the master race, I got used to the smooth 60 fps. When I went to cinema to see a movie, I just couldn't enjoy it, especially with action scenes. The 24 fps felt like a 2 hour hell... How can someone enjoy a movie when it's 24 fps? It literally hurts my eyes.
13282	I know it's a joke, but if there were ever a land invasion of the US a large portion of the population would be out there with their own guns shooting at anyone who came near.	Easy: to grab our guns.
13283	Hey, he didn't insult you when he could have given you a sick burn about how your knee is only kind of good enough and plus he wasn't a *total* asshole so he deserves to get what he wants from you as a reward!	Creep thinks he deserves to know what my body looks. Gets pissy when called out
13284	The definition of literally has literally not changed.	Every time something annoying is pointed out that something is always posted a hundred times over. This is the exact same process of using slang words ironically, then suddenly it's stuck in your vocabulary forever. It's why the definition of literally was changed to mean figuratively. Why the hell do you people find it so funny to do the thing that you're making fun of?
13285	Put some hash oil in that gerber shit you know'msayin.	I thought that. Im in no way endorsing smoking with a baby feeding
13286	Either they are the type of people that should not be targeted in these discussions, they're not anywhere near the problem.	technically theyll be in so much debt from student loans they wont be better off than anyone else.

13292	Their neighbor's salary literally comes out of their ridiculously-inflated taxes, might be the reason why.	I agree. The problem is that people in the private sector have been getting dicked around for the past 20 years and they would rather attack their neighbors salary than their CEOs salary. I dont know why people feel this way, but they do. I think its a bit of Stockholm syndrome.
13293	I like you.	You mean the scavengers as large as chickens? Not particularly worrisome. Now the Utahraptor on the other hand....

13298	That's skepticism, not pessimism.	The pessimist in me says that they showed us three weapons in the CG cutscene and those three weapons were used in combat so those are probably the only ones we'll get. Hopefully that's wrong, but we'll see.

13301	So if I wait until after my subscription expires before cashing out, I won't have to pay the transaction fees?	1. Yes 2. You will pay transaction fees as long as you are subscribed. 3. If you currently have items on sale and you upgrade to a subscription, your items will automatically be calculated to the new percentage when they are sold. Same rule applies if your subscription runs out. Free featured does not mean you get to pick any $1000 knife on the front page each month and get it for free. 'Featured' means the 300 OP surcharge is waived when you want to 'Feature' your item.

13326	Maybe where they come from being a grocery clerk is an esteemed position from which you can practically be your own boss.	I used to work in refugee resettlement and had a lot of clients who were new to the US that had complaints like this, ie. "I work in the bakery section, but my boss asked me to cover produce today instead- he's taking advantage of me! This must be illegal!" It was my job to calmly explain to them that there was nothing strange about their employers request. I never figured out where that mindset came from.

I've taught people who have told me they've tried and never succeeded but with me they did it the very first time. I can help with mindfulness, Zen, or transcendental. I also practice Raja Yoga and could help there too. Asana, pranayama etc. I'm no Buddha. I'm only partly budist. I'm modern age and down to earth. My goal is to teach meditation to the masses.

13346	Plenty of positions opening up at the local yacht dealership.	It doesn't matter, boats are *very* expensive to maintain, moor, especially salt water vessels. Even if they have their boat registered off-shore, maintaining them creates many jobs, even staffing them. A large yacht needs a captain, deck hands, and so forth. I don't understand which jobs are at risk by the boat being registered somewhere else.

13360	The fact he's buck ass naked shoveling snow as a joke really speaks to his great character and thoughtfullness.	The title is disingenuous. He wasn't advocating that people commit acts of violence against Walker. He was speaking directly to the people in the picture of an event that already happened. It was very clearly meant as a joke. That being said, it wasn't a funny at all. He should apologize to the public, if not to comedy itself.
13361	But guys...this doesn't line up with the Marvel/Netflix conspiracy theories!	Justice League, JLU, and Young Justice back on USA Netflix I just logged into Netflix to watch a few more episodes of Daredevil when i noticed JLU was back in my queue. Checked for Brave and the Bold and Green Lantern TAS and those searches came up empty, but i'm stoked at least some of these shows have been renewed! Either that or i caught a lucky glitch.
13362	Youre part of that forum, you are horrible horrible man child.	I feel like, as with most anonymous internet forums, the extremists rise to the top. Are there racists and assholes and bad people in law enforcement? Absolutely. I don't think anyone would dispute that. But I think these forums over represent those types of people. There is a Border Patrol forum that's only available for sworn Agents and it's completely full of mostly terrible people. Which is not my real life experience with my co workers at all.

13366	The conditioner analogy kind of proves my point - don't leave product in stuff that is in contact with your skin if you want to be on the safe side.	Proper wool washes like I've recommended aren't the same as "washing powder" and many are designed to be no-rinse. They're somewhat more comparable to washing hair with conditioner than a harsh washing detergent.

Would you rather then remove custom servers entirely just so there can't be a single pay to win? With how much bad publicity pay to win gets they would be idiots to put it in the game in the first place.

Last I checked shrapnel shouldn't go through concrete barriers, brick walls, or cars but they still do; making it so you can't take cover from grenades. You should be able to throw a grenade around a corner and wait for it to go off before running in but, instead you have to throw it around the corner and then run away because the grenades aren't designed correctly. It has happened too many times where people go down because grenades damage players through walls and it needs to stop happening.

Don't let this stuff fool you into trying to live a life like that so you can maybe qualify, without a athletic past or genetics like that. Don't throw all that money away or that quality of life.

I feel like it really is one of the most resilient sites on the internet. To allocate resources to taking it down is a waste of resources. Plus even if you could destroy it and wipe it off the internet, a replacement for it will quickly pop up. Hell there are already tons of alternatives to TPB. Taking it down is only going to spawn more file sharing sites
13415	So basically giving Canadians playing time is inversely related to on-field success?	The Whitecaps were last in playing time in MLS minutes and the only club to make the playoffs, we were also #1 in playing time for Canadian players in the Voyageur's Cup, and we finished last. It's idiotic to make player decisions based on citizenship.

Conflicting answers monitoring voltages, VID &amp; VIN4 in HWmonitor vs core voltage in cpu-z I've been trying to use adaptive voltage and I set the max turbo voltage and it never seems to listen to what I type. After a lot of searching people say with an Asus mobo, HWmonitor shows the cpu core voltage as VIN4...not VID. My issue with this is that the VID in HWmonitor mirrors the "Core voltage" in Asus CPU-Z. But here is the kicker...the VIN4 values match exactly what I type into adaptive voltage in my BIOS. But this would also mean my CPU drops to .016 volts at idle. I don't know what to think anymore. Which is my true CPU voltage? How else can I check? - Asus z97-A mobo - I7 4790k cpu

The difference is that it doesn't outstay its welcome. It can be all wrapped up in about half an hour, as long as you have a reasonable number of players (don't try playing it with more than 4, that's when it starts to drag).

13474	Definitely got Nutmeg confused with Nutella and got very confused reading that.	An old friend who unfortunately is no longer with us used to throw house parties all the time in high school. It would usually be 15-30 people getting wasted and doing hard drugs. This one particular time he hosted a massive high school party because his parents weren't home. So he had probably between 80-90 of us teenagers at his house partying like crazy. Ecstasy, Coke, Shrooms, and of course tons of pot and booze. About an hour and a half goes by and people are messed up and having a blast. I did about 4-5 grams of shrooms that night so I was toast. My buddy who hosted the party filled up capsules with nutmeg...yes nutmeg...and he was swallowing those all night. (Read up about a large consumption of nutmeg). So like I said, an hour and a half goes by and someone asks him where his parents went on vacation. His response... "They're not on vacation. They went out to watch a movie." Just then is when the car rolled up on the driveway filled with a bunch of drunk ad stoned punks. Everyone ran out of the house and to the park closest to his place. Every single person in that house took off. Everyone. Even the guy who hosted the party. I dunno if he was worried his parents would kill him or if the nutmeg fucked him up so much that he didn't know he was at his own house. Man I miss that guy.

13493	Of course it would never have anything to do with the resonance of his message.	Why exactly has the media begun to pay so much attention to the polls in New Hampshire? Sanders is from Vermont.

13505	Squash is pretty good, its an easy game to learn, but a hard game to get really good at, so there's people at all levels.	Learn to play sports as an adult for fitness? Hi Fitness, Just wanted to get everyone's opinion, I like going to the gym to workout regularly, however it gets old. My question is as follows: When we were in high school or below, it seems in the USA at least those were the prime formative years for learning to play sports. Once you get above a certain age threshold, a place to learn and play an organized sport goes away quite readily, even though the desire may still be there. Example: I play Ice Hockey, but haven't learned how to play basketball at all. I'm an adult who works, but would like to play organized basketball, in a learning environment with other people at my same skill level(super noob). I'd like to go to a series organized team practices, and then on the weekends play against other teams who have done the same. AFAIK, there really isn't a place to go to do such a thing is there? Same would go for other sports, baseball, Football, etc...year round. Pretty much would like the idea behind a scholastic level athletic training for adults. It just would seem like a great way to learn a sport, play it, and get a great workout in as well. I know there are amateur leagues, etc, but there doesn't seem to be a place to find "amateur/newb team practices with games included" if that makes any sense. If there is such a thing/gym that does this, I want to join.
13506	Agreed, you've been given a random assortment of meat chunks.	The grain of the meat doesnt look right, just some random pieces of stew meat.

13511	That's obviously because Microsoft made it so their tablet would recognize Chrome and make it run slower on purpose which in turn makes IE look better in comparison.	I bought a low-end Windows 7" tablet for $60. I tried Chrome and it was a resource hog. Surprisingly IE ran faster and smoother and played HD videos while Chrome couldn't and I'd run out of memory. The Metro app is even snappier. I added AdBlock Plus to it and so far am quite happy.
13512	I go to offline places, with nice environment * Second bonfire on Heide (to see the sea and the dusk) * The Place Unbeknownst, on FotFG (because the sound of the tree) * The Altar of Amana (when the brunette Milfanito is singing)	Favorite places to relax in?

13520	I hate high schoolers	I actually ordered something gross on purpose. Back in high school in the summers, my friends and I were out at all hours of the night. We sometimes congregated at Denny's just to hang out so we didn't wake our families up. Anyways, I came up with the stupid idea of a "Pan-Shake" instead of a pancake. We were regulars here, so we asked our waitress to make it and gave specifications. Basically, it was a milkshake with a blended up pancake and maple syrup in it. The grossest part was that, instead of whipped cream, we got butter. It was actually decent aside from the butter and soggy pancake bits. It was funny either way.
13521	Thank you.	Some really nice shots amongst them.
13522	We started out posting pictures of pigs, then moved up to hams, and then into slamming attractive humans through their favorite hashtags, the mooing was amazing, some of us got some serious hatemail from these butter golems.	Real talk? I didn't even see the actual pigs.

13524	Uh, we have a black guy running for president too, isn't that enough for you?	Speaking as a Black man, I have to say that I love the moves the GOP is making; Voter ID laws, gerrymandering, Real ID, banning and restricting polling days, curbing absentee voting e.t.c.....they are truly ready to welcome minorities into their party and usher in a new era
13525	its my least favorite season for sure, I can see where OP is coming from.	Season 2 of breaking bad is anything but slow
13526	And if you like scifi check out Moon, the underappreciated gem.	I'd also recommend the Babadook, very chilling movie.
13527	Most people categorize "makes me look bad" and "doesn't make me look good" together, so just say "it's not flattering" and be done with it.	I hate being lied to when I ask if something makes me look fat. Tell me I look fat/it looks ill-fitting, or I may just think it looks fine for another occasion when no one is around to tell me I look like a sausage. If I look bad in it I want to make sure I don't wear it again.
13528	Let's give them 25 extra points in every game that they're playing a lower seed.	What slight advantage can we give to excellent regular season teams other than just 1 measly extra home game? The regular season is sooo long and after months of basketball, teams with high seeds just "home court advantage" in the form of 1 extra home game. 1. Extra. Home. Game. That's nothing. I feel like after all the grind of the regular season their should be more to play for than just that one extra home game. Otherwise who cares if you're a 1 seed or a 7 seed. Just ask San Antonio. So what's a way to give overachieving regular season teams more of an advantage than just one extra home game, so that there's more to play for and more of an incentive to do good.
13529	Every player on Elements (the roster with nyph) went to s4 worlds look how they dominated	Teams in EULCS should fear Origen. This team looked horrifying. 4 out of 5 players have been to Worlds. Feels like Origen has what it takes to beat all teams in the LCS now.
13530	At my high school a group of kids shot a deer and left it on the band's trailer... hilarious.	This just reminds me of the fact that at my high school, there is a tradition of all the graduating students pulling a senior prank. It's always been a tradition, but this year we had an assembly where a cop told us that if we pull a prank this year, we will all be getting charged. It's lunacy.

13536	I'm sure if this was CSI, we'd get a better look at the Teaser.	Human-Sized Look at Ant-Man Teaser... Sort of
13537	He was -20 because he only played 25 minutes.	It completely does. He would've played the fourth quarter if he wasn't a - 20 for the game. He wasn't doing anything else offensively or defensively, finished with barely any assists
13538	Not unless his feet are numb!	c'mon dude, a Detroit Lion player can't win a presidential election. The refs won't allow it
13539	But without woodwinds, the people hundreds of feet away from the field are going to miss hearing those pretty flutes and clarinets!	College bands still have those? \#allbrass
13540	A Doctor Who convention, because they would all be freaking out about Weeping Angels and hurting themselves in their panic.	If every statue in the world came to life at the same time, which area would be in the most trouble?
13541	TIL nationalised rail network = automatically lower fares	Here is yet another reason why our railways should be nationalised again.
13542	I havent seen Unidan around recently.. Say, what happened to that guy?	What are the once-popular but now largely forgotten trends of reddit? Are they a loss or good riddance?
13543	Just remember if you're an archeologist and you find something weird instead of doing work and finding out the origin or purpose of it and how it was made, just throw your hands up and say it was aliens	Bro, the evidence looks fabricated only because the aliens are really advanced bro. So the fact that it looks fabricated gives credence to the theory!
13544	you filthy capitalist, you think you know everything	Much of corporate "America" does indeed fund Israel. Not really a "conspiracy", just sound application of business and political acumen on the part of American Jews (and Israelis). Microsoft has research centres in Israel, as does Intel and most of the US' telecoms infrastructure is managed through Israeli technology firms. The problem I have with Muslims (and White anti-Semites) on this front is that business and politics are forums for intellectual competition. If you're too stupid to use your obvious advantages (Whites = home field AND domestic numbers, Muslims = global numbers AND immense oil wealth) to play the game better than a few million Jews, you deserve no sympathy. There are *trillions* of "petrodollars" swishing around in Wall Street and the US corporate economy. Both in the defence industry (Carlyle Group and Boeing for example) and in major multi-national corporations (Nortel and Pepsi have huge SWF investments from the Middle East). How does *AIPAC* manage to get *EVERY US president* to swear fealty, while Muslims just act stupid? If Muslims were smarter, they would stop being Muslims but, also, they would be respectable competitors and play a role in governing corporations and their strategic investments globally.
13545	We must be playing the console version	A spinning circle that says loading. Then suddenly more space and stars...
13546	Obviously that was a plot to prevent them from being able to say they are tax payers.	actually, there's no sales tax in Oregon
13547	Because team chemistry is overrated	Yes it's the best players in the NFL on one team, they would beat almost any team at any time IMO.
13548	When Hai was at his best he was playing Zed and Fizz and Kha as assassins.	Hai just needs a stable champ pool of safe afk farm champions so he can shot call and play safe. The team has never required him to play play making assassins, and especially now that sneaky has stepped up big time they don't need him on play making champions. When he performed the best it was on lane bullies and he'd typically just go even..

13551	Too bad he's being held back right?	This fast lane, Daniel Bryan will be in the main-event of the fifth-consecutive pay-per-view he had a match in. There will be a streak broken at WrestleMania and it's not Taker's.
13552	No John Cena 0/10, not all best Johns.	Fact: the islanders have all the best johns playing in this game tonight.
13553	IIRC Jashodaben converted that White woman and 'that' Peter to Hindus.	Nice. Any follow-up on what became of this?
13554	but hey, Arch is *super* streamlined, is the best minimal distro	Yeah, the reason behind that is because Arch doesn't split up binary packages into -bin and -dev packages. The source package names in Debian are usually the same as in Arch, but we have to use slightly more complex names for the different binary packages we create from one source package. You can now debate which approach is better: Always installing all development files (headers and libraries) and all kinds of additional documentation and extra files together with the actual binary package or split them off like in Debian so you can trim down the disk footprint of your installation by not installing all that additional stuff which isn't needed for runtime use only. I prefer Debian's approach over Arch's approach since Debian allows for much more complex and flexible setups. I can easily install versions for different architectures of the same library onto one system without any additional hacks. On Debian, I can do an installation on a powerpc system and just cross-install an i386 Skype binary package and run it seamlessly using qemu-user-static without any additional hacks. I just need to enable "i386" in the package manager, run apt-get update and install the Skype i386 package on the powerpc machine. Debian's approach also helps when cross-compiling and other cross-arch and cross-distro applications. Arch just suits one use case which is provide the latest packages for one architecture which is amd64.

13567	I dont know why anyone uses a scripting language for backend when theres C and C++	javascript on the server side Recently I was interviewing for a company that seems to run their backend on the mean stack. this made me wonder how much sense does it make to run JavaScript on the server side. We all know that Javascript as language has a lot of short comings, so why not use a better language for the server side. What is wrong with using java or python if one wants something interpreted. JavaScript is cool, but I don't think it is very appropriate choice for a web server language.

13569	she likes you m9 ask her out just be confident	nice man, at least it didn't go down like how i almost had a first kiss *OP tells a story* One day, one of my friends with his girlfriend and a girl I liked as well, were hanging out before the last days of school, so were playing truth or dare. Now comes the bad part My crush was dared to kiss me, and her first reaction was ( i kid you not) , "Ew! I refuse to!" Burned me hard, but it was even worse when she rejected me from senior prom when she didn't have a prom date. So I still don't understand to this day.
13570	Nah i think were better off spending 4 billion on elections over a couple months instead of spending it on those pointless space things....	"Imagine what could be done with a penny for NASA?"

13593	Those are the paths that the US Army is going to march political dissenters too when they impose martial law.	What's with the "FORBIDDEN ZONE" signs on Hwy 287? On Highway 287 between Palestine and Corsicana today I noticed a series of big (probably 10 foot wide) wooden signs along the tree line that said "FORBIDDEN ZONE - TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED" for a couple miles. Near the end of it, it appeared to perhaps be a dam behind some barbed wire fences. Is there anything cool or sketchy going on back there, or is it just a dam?

Dan mag hij volgens de definitie wel geen volksvertegenwoordiger zijn, maar aan zijn functie als gedeputeerde zit ook een morele kant. En nu Verheijen 2e kamer lid is komt daar een hogere moraal bij kijken, en hij dus sterker stelling moet nemen tegen zijn corrupte gedrag in zijn verleden als gedeputeerde.

13670	Also more disclosure of any interest groups or lobbyists backing the research, or any other points of research bias, because it seems that this is the single most common cause for conflicting research findings.	Even then, you should still check the actual methods before accepting the results.
13671	Let's gooooo!	New Action Bronson Track coming???
13672	Ah good, better make sure to do some stat padding and suiciding.	banned from Koltyr you mean? If its implemented in such a way that you get forced to the main game if you get a certain amount of kills in a certain amount of time its a great idea.
13673	It was just trying to ascend into a true AMD card, but the cooling failed.	7970 died spectacularly on me this morning, fire and everything :/
13674	Produced by the History Channel!	The timeline was always off. Aelle died nearly 100 years after first meeting Ragnar in the show in 793, Ecbert would've been king for MAYBE a year or 3, Judith was from Flanders, not the daughter of Aelle, Bjorn was born about 50 years early, Horik I died 50 or so years later than in the show and didn't have a son named Erlandur. It's not meant to line up at all really. I should add also that the historical Rollo's wife has been cast for this season, and the turning over of Normandy was likely a result of Ragnar (Reginherus') raid on Paris.
13675	just wait for the darius buffs to come through, and the dunking legacy can be fulfilled im sure the ult changes make him LCS viable	I think Dyrus is annoyed at the way they play but he knows that it's currently their best way to play and Dyrus is 100% a team first player. Let's just hope Jayce top becomes meta again before Dyrus retires, he could 1v9 on that champ...
13676	Because Earthbound and Mother are totally unpopular with anyone else except Japan.	An exasperated warning from my local GameStop employee... She said Nintendo was giving GameStop ~9000 Ness Amiibo to divvy up to their 6500 sites. What is Nintendo thinking? These things are ridiculously popular. I don't understand.....
13677	Holy shit, the Warriors play in the West?	And they did that in the west.
13678	The media has certainly been too easy on Snowden....	I on the other hand enjoyed seeing Snowden answer some hardball questions from a somewhat adversarial interviewer for the first time.
13679	well.... it was milwaukee	Ryan Braun got cheered when he came back, so I don't know why people are surprised.
13680	Of course, conservatives always stick to what they say before elections.	The Tories have ruled out a deal with Ukip - and they're right to do so | The Conservatives are right to deny the toxic suggestion that they would shack up with Farage.
13681	You're obviously racist because you noticed she was black.	HOLY FUCK this is so relevant right now. Just a couple of days ago I was in line at the gas station. There are 3 registers, but one line for all three. Some fat black woman stepped up directly behind the person in front one of the registers. I said "Excuse me, ma'am, but the end of the line for all the registers is back here." To which she launched into a tirade about how I expect her to go to the back of the line like it was the back of the bus, how I shouldn't talk to a woman like that, that I need slapped, blah blah blah. I retorted that a true woman wouldn't immediate launch into a curse-ridden tirade just for being asked to be fair to the people who had been in line, and that if she wanted to slap me, she was welcome to, but that I believe that "Equal Rights means Equal Lefts, so you better be ready for what you get if you do decide to slap me". Seriously, fuck the assholes who perpetuate the stereotype of the ignorant, violent black person. I am friends and co-worker of very successful, intelligent, respectful, and (OMG!) nice people who are black, and this cunt is going around ruining society's initial outlook on them. Fuck her.
13682	It is if they pay entry level rates.	But then it's not ENTRY level.
13683	Yep, like the other guy commenting on this lol	This is what some people actually believe....
13684	If you're publicly drunk and aggressive, you can be aggressive to anyone and it's ok to do so.	Sorry, Englishman here. Does being American automatically entitle you to be abusive to police officers? Because i thought being abusive to anyone isn't nice.
13685	Tape a desk fan to your computer	My computer fan broke yesterday and I can't have a new one until the next Wednesday. God damn it :(
13686	I like how he has different scenarios	Long shitty erotica but omg so SO worth it for the gold at the end.
13687	No he's just a sellout who bans his subs for just being in chat.	His income is directly related to viewership, advertising revenue, and donations, which come from again, viewers. If SC2 has a dying population, Destiny would be fucking stupid if he didn't branch out and try other popular games, to perpetuate his income. Blizzard blew it with WoL and HotS, his views on SC2 are not unfounded. Give the man some slack, he's just trying to pay his bills, like the rest of us.
13688	Cloud chasing is new?	Rip Trippers on front page of Gizmodo for cloud chasing
13689	Hold on, hold on, I think I fixed mine!	What detector? OH! That may be part of the reason sarcasm mode keeps on enabling and disabling! It is not detecting the current state and is trying to debug itself! **Stop-it! Stop-it! Stop-It! Off! Off! OFF! BAD SARCASM MODE!**
13690	You mean us actual Nexus users?	Yes. The beta tester guy must have missed it.
13691	But don't you get it businesses that allow their slav---erm, I mean employees to get abortions are EVIL.	This bill is actually pretty remarkable. It simultaneously makes Affordable Healthcare (Obamacare) look bad by removing tax credits from small businesses who use the SHOP exchange, if the Healthcare they provide covers abortion, while also further denying women access to abortions. So you have a bill, sponsored and unanimously supported by the republican party that uses government to impose their will on the people and raises taxes on small businesses. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the exact opposite of their entire platform?
13692	Move Toure to CDM, Di Maria/Fernandinho at Right CM, and either IF David Silva at CAM	Thoughts on this crash squad? Thanks for helping, much appreciated!
13693	NNNNNOOOOOOOooooooooo	Jamie McGinn might have season-ending back surgery, Patrick Roy says. But no decision yet.
13694	I know this is off topic, but has anyone actually pm'd you their cleavage?	What's an upvote? Is it in the next version of reddit?
13695	Must've been them dam flying machines.	If you can not figure out how you could transport anything over a vertical distance using machinery in any other way than to pump it through a tube, then perhaps you should keep away from engineering discussions.
13696	First thing to do is ask reddit, because that makes sense.	I just got billed $97 for what is certainly a mistake! Who do I contact?? Thanks for any advice in advance. Last semester, I rented a text book, and now I've returned it via post office on the very last day I as able to (07 January). I read the FAQ and the rental return policy, which states that as long as the items are post marked for that day, then I should be ok... Now I've got an email saying I've been billed nearly a hundred bucks! What do I do, who do I talk to, and what do I say? I'm so used to corporations treating stuff like this as a money grab, but a hundred bucks is a big deal and I'd really like to get it back.
13697	I can't wait for Top Gear to review this and hate it because it's American.	THE NEW FORD GT!
13698	We're nothing like ISIS, the only people that we kill are the evil people who need to be killed!	There are a lot of people in real life who believe it's acceptable foreign policy to just become the bigger, more powerful ISIS to defeat ISIS.
13699	Yay for fraud!	No, you cant in BC as you don't have the residency requirements. Though, I alittle bird told me once if you use someone else's care card and don't have to show photo id, you can get get away with it.
13700	It's nice to see that the progressive policies of our country fainally pays off.	TIL There are more "Swedish" ISIS jihadists per capita than any other western country (from October 2014)
13701	Because men are so privileged that they have no reason to get depressed.	If a man made DQ he'd still be regulated to the unknown pits of Newgrounds with barely even a rating there. Why does a piece of absolute low effort garbage like DQ get such a pass from everyone? Why does no one take Broteam's stuff and the other people who came out about Zoe seriously and continue to defend her without qualification? This is the first one that even admitted Wizardchan had some justification in defending themselves at least.
13702	That is an awesome use for that meme.	Does she know what she's getting into?
13703	Omg even if shes overweight and u dont find her attractive u should like her, you shallow pig	Am I an asshole? So, I met some chick on tinder the other day, and we agreed to meet up at a mutual friends party, when I got there she was about 50+ kgs over what I expected, I told her straight to her face that I'm not even going to bother with someone that obviously catfished and lied to me. She then started crying and called me every name under the sun, even wanted to start a swack. I got kicked out of the party and no one would give me a lift so I had to walk home 10km in the middle of fucking nowhere. God that fucking sucked. Was I really in the wrong here?
13704	What's his patreon?	Should we still pay him the full week's wage?
13705	No idea... Food or sleep it's hard to tell.	...about what, exactly?
13706	Good thing we skipped current gen then!	Nothing more, nothing less
13707	Man I thought racial issues in the world were worrying turns out emojis are the biggest problem facing minorities and all these "racial tensions" I hear about must not be real...	white people ruin emojis
13708	BUT SHE'S A WOMAN AND BEING HARRASSED LISTEN AND BELIEVE SHITLORD	How is this about her gender? This has nothing to do with her gender, and everything to do with the fact that she was scamming people and also possibly (probably) cheating during the ESL tournament that "she" won. Just like Twitch and Reddit gave RDU, gHosty, etc shit for "cheating" their gender, ethnicity, etc had nothing to do with it. Scammers and cheaters are trash that need to be outed and banned from the scene regardless of who they are or what they look like. I never liked MagicAmy because of all of the attention whoring she did in almost every popular Hearthstone Twitch stream. Then she signed with Tempostorm and won that ESL tournament and I gained mad respect for her, I was entertaining the possibility she might be actually be Jesus. Now with the accusations, and evidence presented against her (both hard and circumstantial), combined with her outright refusal to give a rebuttal or make any attempt to clear her name that screams "guilty" to me. This is not a court of law in the United States, this is the court of public opinion and a preponderance of evidence will do just fine for a conviction. I have played Counterstrike in its various forms for almost 15 years now, and a catchphrase from CS seems to ring particularly true here: "do it on LAN". If someone is offering you an all expenses paid trip to prove your skill live and in person and you refuse it, you will always have a shroud of doubt surrounding your ability. With all of the nonsense surrounding MagicAmy from multiple sources, and her refusal to make any attempt to clear her name. I think Reynad has it backwards, anyone defending MagicAmy at this point it is probably the virgin neckbeards. Anyone with half of a brain cell should be extremely skeptical of MagicAmy at this point.

Let's share some quotes of the show. One of my best is when Walt was talking with a student who wanted a couple of points on his test and he said **"Don't bullshit the bullshiter."**
13712	Because girls are totally obligated to be in a relationship at all times am I right guys?	"Yup! Don't have to be creative w sluts on this site"

13715	That's actually a gendered insult, I'd prefer if you used boogeyperson.	Shouldn't everything tagged on MR be "re: Feminism"? Since none of it's actually about helping men as a class and it's just about the boogeyman of feminism?

13736	i thought i had a bad eye for Shopped images	Those are actually really cool when did they wear that? Or is that shopped?
13737	I'd say Dark Souls except that you can change equipment and upgrade yourself.	Games of any genre and platform, that are NOT about the player. Excepting MMO (since probably all of them would fit here), I am looking for games that don't has rules specific to the player, even better if that is obvious, with stuff just happening around you as you go. For strategy and 4x games a good example would be games where the AI don't cheat, and don't gank on you, and instead treat you as they would treat another AI player. For games where you go on an adventure (ie: FPS, action-adventure, RPGs, etc...) is one where the NPCs follow the exact same rules as you, and if possible they continue to be simulated while you are not there, and can interact with each other. For business simulation games, it is when the AI can run business using rules similar to yours.

13752	Console-only players.	Who does?
13753	They should probably just use snipers to take out speeders; it's much safer for the cops.	St. Augustine man was in his bed with a knife, threatening suicide. His girlfriend called a non-emergency number to try to get him into a hospital. Minutes later, he was shot and killed in his bedroom by cops with assault rifles.
13754	I haven't noticed text problems (except signal loss), but MMS is a total crapshoot - send or receive :(	I don't know how long you've been with Wind but it was never this bad. Not even in the beginning. I've had more of those missed call texts in the last 2 weeks than I had in the last 4 years.

13766	You for got the	As someone who has protested and worked to stop the cruel and violent destruction of our planet by these corporate criminals, I am highly offended that CSGO has made a map such as this. It can be inferred from the map setup that the Valve believes that all environmental activists are terrorists? Sickening. When will this oppression stop? Trees should have equal rights with humans. We are both living creatures. Valve set an example and take this map off rotation.
13767	Damning Curse.	Public Apology: Coronation Hate I have been outspoken since the announcement of this scroll as the winner of the competition, saying that the scroll was terrible and overall slinging mud and salt. I apologize, I was wrong. After playing some games (I lost them to haste growth) I came to realize that the scroll introduces a new "fun" factor in the excitement of a 1cdr unit huge unit, balanced with the other excitement of being on the verge of losing every single turn. Actually using it well will be tough, but I can see it working and making the game more exciting!

So tonight I was working and demoing a massage chair for a guy. He yells over to his wife, "I just found exactly what I want to wake up to Christmas morning!" She turns from the squishy pillows she was looking at and yells back, "What, the chair or the chick in the tight sweater showing it to you?" Not in a funny "ha ha" lighthearted way, but in a very "I hate my husband and am a giant bitch" kind of way. Ugh, it's going to be a long holiday season. Good luck to all of us for the next month! I love you all!

13805	But adding porn makes thing so edgy and fun!	Yea and I understand the thought behind them but I really wish they were named something different. It's really awkward having to explain it to someone who hasn't heard of them. Especially if that someone is your mom or something.

13807	And then I pull out my d-tilt and RAR back air and show you my true speed	In my experience, Ike is a character you never want to attack directly. His moves hit hard, and he has a tendency to just tank his way through anything coming his way. That said, almost all of his attacks are *painfully* slow, letting you see what's coming days ahead of time. If you can get in to a style of letting him make the first move and recognizing what his moves look like, you can figure out how to get out of his way and turn him in to a walking punching bag. He's extremely vulnerable during and after his attacks when he's not on target.
13808	Yeah, but their first line center is getting paid like a lot like a good second line center, so it's all relative.	He's at the point where production starts to trend downward. He's had injury concerns as well. 7.5M for a second line center is steep in most circumstances.

13813	His position is incorrect in that torture would not have helped in that scenario, but not the scenario itself.	"You posit the situation where a person that you know for sure knows the location of a nuclear bomb that has been planted in Los Angeles and will kill millions of people. " so it is disingenuous that quote, would remind people of the time he used 24, the show, with that exact plot line in an earlier discussion on the exact same topic?

Seeing as how section 11.8 of the LPO constitution allows the party leader to appoint a candidate, and seeing as how Thibeault was appointed to be the candidate, there was no nomination race and the first paragraph of that article is highly misleading. But one doesn't read the Sun to be informed.

Any thoughts or advice? Thanks all!

Obviously not a new player unless he got lucky. Say hi. No answer. Ask if he has a mike. Wild shaking which I assume meant "no". "Ok dude press slash(/) to type". He asks me if he could have some food so I go in my pack and drop a few cans of beans. Suddenly he draws his AK, points it at me and says over his mike "Sucker I know you've got more food. Drop your pack!" I laugh and tell him he doesn't have any ammo. "Oh yeah?!" *shoots his chambered round at my feet* "Drop your stuff!!" Bash his head in while his gun goes *click click click* then carved him up and had some steak. God I love this game.

13888	Ya, our best goal scorer is clearly the reason why we suffer defensively...	yea it also makes everyone push up the pitch to attack leaving us defensively open, that's why we've being doing so bad defensively at the begining as the players get used to the balance, without sanchez where would we be? higher than we are right now that's for sure, although over time we will be a much better team with him

I had a crush on her and even after the first day it really felt like we hit it off well. She even seemed to show signs that she liked me back. I spoke to her quite a lot over a course of 5 days and when we went out we would leave our friends and go exploring places. Yesterday she pretty much became my gf because she became very flirty all of a sudden and I was really enjoying it. We were lying on a bed in a shop and after we got kicked out she asked if we were a thing, and of course i said yes. No other girl has ever been like this one. tl;dr met a girl, had a crush on her and now she's my gf

13907	When she's 18 if she looks you up see where it goes, if not completely forget about it and in the mean time just live your life, normal dating and such and what not, no one is judging you.	In love..with a little girl I have lurked on reddit for a long long time, never had the courage to post anything. I am at a breaking point and can't take it any longer. For obvious reasons I can't talk to anyone about this, not even my wife. A few years ago, while still a teenager, I got my first job, at a time in my life when I had some very serious stuff going on. All my friends had abandoned me, and I had no one to turn to. Anyways after a few months of working there my boss invited me over to watch some football. Naturally, while they're, I met his family, including his then 6 year old daughter who we'll call maddie. At the time I didn't think anything of it. Well time went on and me and my boss became better friends. Started drinking together, smoking together, just killing time. Well shit in my life wasnt getting any easier, and I was gradually becoming more and more depressed. I had no reason to go on, no reason to wake up. Before I knew it though, his daughter began really attaching herself to me. She was always by my side. She'd run to the door screaming my name when I arrived with a huge smile on her face. She'd sit on my lap at every chance she got, and just generally treated me like I was the best thing in the world. Still I didn't think anything of it. A bit more time went by, and I started feeling emotions that bothered me. I missed her when I wasn't with her. I started smelling her shampoo, hearing her voice when she wasn't around. When I was with her, I felt conflicted. She was 6 years old, but I developed a crush. I started seeing her not as cute, but CUTE. I loved her smile, her laugh. I wanted her near me all the time. One day she gave me a kiss, and I felt a spark id never felt before. It was pure electricity. I was in love. But immediately I felt an immense amount of shame and guilt. I didn't know how to wrap my mind around the fact that I was in love with a little girl. Days turned to weeks and stuff kept progressing. Where she used to be a sweet innocent little girl, she started turning secretive. She used to sit next to me and hold my hand, but she started putting a blanket over her lap in an effort to hide the fact she was holding my hand. She'd wait till her parents left the room and kiss me, where she used to just do it without a second thought. One night when id been drinking with her dad she came into the room and set next to me. After a quick glance at her dad, she reached over and grabbed my crotch . I freaked out, but had the presence of mind to smoothly take her hand in mine and move it without dressing attention to myself. After that night nothing like that happened again, but she would still kiss me and do things like hug me whenever her parents left the room. As the years have passed she has stopped a lot of that behavior, but the sexual tension between us is unbelievable. I feel like it can be felt in the air. I just don't know what to do anymore. I just had to get it off my chest. I feel so guilty, and I don't know how to cope with this anymore.

That is for the Netherlands, though, and I'm pretty sure chocolate sprinkles on buttered white bread, maybe with a side of chocolate milk, is a normal adult meal there.

13920	Have you tried nuva ring?	I'm not sure how many cycles you have per year, but I'm calculating 13 x 2 days x 5 years = **130 days***. My surgeon indicated that Mirena can take up to 6 months to settle down (and even then, there's no guarantee it will settle completely), so 6 months * 30 days = 180 days. Mathematically, the painkiller option still seems to make sense. Financially, I'm also not sure if I'm prepared to pay $1000+ on *trying* something that I really don't want anyway.
13921	Yes, I'm sure finding parking reasonably close to the fest will be a breeze.	Meh, it's really just a matter of perspective. I know we all love our cars, but the street closures elevate the pedestrian (i.e. the actual people at the festival) over cars wishing to drive in the area. This is as it should be, especially when there's perfectly serviceable public transit to get you pretty close. And, anyway, all that's closed are the streets in the immediate area. You can park anywhere you want elsewhere in the park or outside of it.

I started at 140 pounds and am finally at the point where I can lift 225 on flat, I'm obviously here to get stronger. What are you talking shit for?

13940	I think I failed more exams because of Twin Emps than any other reason.	I think Twin Emps were the real hell of that instance. That and the double Anubis guard trash leading up to them. Meteor+Plague OH GOD.
13941	God, it's like you've never even *heard* of the Village People!	A gay police officer? You're like a unicorn that I've been searching for.
13942	That might be encouraging his opinion, but it certainly doesn't mean that no single guys today are pro-marriage, or anything like.	Doesn't seem like anyone wants to get married. His buds are all single never married too.
13943	The sweat is real	Reddit Black takes 2nd place in Diamond Division
13944	Political will, maybe?	I wonder, why can't they carry out operations like Mossad?
13945	So let's stick with holocaust jokes where millions of people were executed because they're unimportant Jews amirite?	It's still too soon to joke about. 2000+ families lost their family members that day.
13946	I will buy future total war games, because they are awesome, but I will wait until the game is playable.	If the last year of steady support and communication, 14 massive patches built upon from direct discussions and requests from the community (including siege AI), and a good handful of free content added to the game doesn't recover a lot of CA's image for you, well..
13947	I'd say it's more apathy than anarchy	Big W understands
13948	All the characters and objects look really detailed, probably because the levels are just simple rectangle rooms.	Is it me, or does this game look *really* pretty for a Gamecube launch title? I mean, the game doesn't look dated at all.
13949	I'd like to listen to The Nerdist podcast to hear the guests, but they inevitably get interrupted every few moments by Hardwick and his need to hear himself fawn over the guest.	HAHAHA POINTS! Ok, but here is a more in depth answer: I said he is the Carson Daly of Comedy. This is because all he does is do a cringe worthy fake laugh, read his extremely scripted lines, and absorb attention meant for others. Just like people tuned into MTV to see music (I know that is an old timey sentence) but were forced to tolerate Carson, people tune into any show Chris is on to see any one but him. Talking Dead? People fell asleep after Walking dead, or tuned in to learn about the actors. All he ever does is break the mood the show created by chiming in with the worst jokes in the middle of episodes. @midnight? People want to see comedians, but are forced to choke down his insanely fake laugh as he interrupts the actual funny people. I also tagged him as the Ken Ham of nerd culture. This is due to him, just like Ken Ham, not knowing one fucking thing about a topic, yet demanding everyone consider him an authority on that topic. Now, I will fully give him credit for being a trend spotter. He saw "nerd culture" as an up and coming trend, got ahead of it, and is fully exploiting it. The problem is when you do this, as something becomes more and more popular, people see how full of shit you are.
13950	Yeah lets kill everyone, that'll stop crime	Millionarie couple fined not even a million for a crime that should carry a fucking death sentence. At least they are geting jail time but the girl should own their asses and their assets. What the hell
13951	RiotGames/LeagueofLegends/Logs/PatcherLogs	im not a techy kind of guy so idk where to go or what to look for
13952	Well, at least now she's a *real* woman.	Woman packs on 50 pounds to prove 'no excuses for being overweight'
13953	I don't know man, you guys have a real question mark at starter.	Pretty good to be honest. The only controversy we have is our 3rd strong QB Renner Vs. Dysert. From what I've heard Renner is winning.
13954	Wow, you're such a martyr	It really matter what I say does it? You will dismiss it and I will reap silent downvotes.
13955	These losers live for this sort of stalking and gossip.	Who gives a fuck?
13956	get a little of each	Is Dogecoin still being developed? Hello, I'm new to cryptocurrencies so I'm in the process of choosing the one I want to stick with. I focused my research mainly on Nxt, vertcoin and Dogecoin. I really like Dogecoin because of its community and because of doge (wow), but my I also noticed that the other ones like Nxt and vertcoin are continuously being developed with new features. So here we are to my question: is Dogecoin still being actively developed and maintained by its developers? Thank you shibes
13957	You forgot the	No way in hell do we have the resources to do something like this in America. Way too many people having far too many babies.
13958	Hey, he's read 50 Shades of Gray, he *clearly* knows what he's talking about.	I'm not in the bdsm community.. But pretty sure this isn't how they operate.
13959	Matt Ryan's smile isn't gorgeous enough	I posted a My Wish video with Matt Ryan and the Falcons.. It was not only downvoted, but the mods removed it! Rant aside, this is awesome. I love seeing stuff like this happen. It's great to see an organization embrace such an opportunity for this child. This definitely makes me respect Cam a little bit more. Kudos to the Panthers for doing this.
13960	Wow another zombie movie	Game of Thrones' Maisie Williams (Arya) In Talks For The Last of Us Movie
13961	And your crime shall be punished with... MORE WHINING!	All I did was thank him for the initial compliment...
13962	you dropped this:	How about a new GD thread every two hours. That would be so awesome
13963	This sounds like the best idea in the world.	A Texas agency wants to allow alcohol sales at gun shows. What could possibly go wrong?
13964	10 seconds my ass, OP you lying bastard how dare you make little Koreans suffer.	Giving EXTREMELY sour warhead candies to my Korean students who have never tried them before
13965	Shut up, commie.	Reading the comments in the AMA on the GMO bill, I no longer have to wonder why the US still has two party politics.
13966	Every man should know this because every man is a rapist.	So why should every man know this? How often are any of us are likely to get tear gas thrown at us?
13967	i only want that cinematic feel	50 FPS Stream for ESL One
13968	But they get $187 back, so doesn't that make them better?	From their insane taxes. 25% vat! high tax on petrol, car tax, sugar tax, etc.

13970	So just remember to pick a champion?	Pick someone who can spank her before level 6.
13971	Right, whoever heard of nationalism and patriotic duty clouding one's judgment here in Korea?	This is an example of a (virtually) perfect substitute. As long as nationalism or patriotic duty doesn't affect one's judgement, consumers should start flooding over to the imported goods.
13972	Yeah, all the European countries seem to totally bow down to their citizens.	Take a page from Europe? There's a reason their governments take public opinion as gospel, when they don't listen, they all get executed in a revolution.
13973	At the very least, a tasty snack.	Hum. Humans are much more complicated than I had guessed on first viewing your planet. It seems a shame that the genetic selection process has allowed such substandard versions to come into existence. Regardless, I feel they will make ample fodder for when the month of sacrifice arrives.
13974	Are you guys allowed to have tobacco products on campus?	Yep!
13975	At a chilly 85F, they even brought their sweaters out!	And the last 3 years have been the coldest winters in Texas...ever.

13978	Dem B'deshi immigrants!	2nd Most spoken language in India = Bengali; 3rd = Telugu; 4th = Marathi; 5th = Tamil
13979	It's a great signal for the EU that Sweden, Germany, Britain &amp; the Netherlands can reach "consensus" on its "reform" without asking us smelly wogs	The leaders of Sweden, Germany, Britain &amp; the Netherlands are meeting at a mini-EU summit near Stockholm to try to reach a consensus on European reform. The controversial question of who is to head the European Commission is likely to be discussed.
13980	Any Dad who doesn't want to take a 4 year old to get a "happy" meal is not living in reality.	TIL that in 2013 a Manhattan dad was deemed "wholly incapable" of parenting his 4-year-old son because he refused to take him to McDonald's.
13981	Go away with your empathy!	C'mon guys cut this kid a break, it's his first film and he's probably only 13 or 14. I bet you guys never created anything stupid or un-funny when you were his age. He's just experimenting with something that he likes you don't have to cut him down when he's got the balls to put it on the internet.
13982	To gain perspective in order to infiltrate of course.	Guys of r/askwomen, why are you here? Is it just curiosity for the other gender, or something different?
13983	I think he was	I don't think he's determined. He was up for 24 hours streaming Wildstar from what I understand. That's not really a good work ethic.
13984	Just like Whites should have never given blacks freedom	We should never have given Hong Kong back to the Chinese. Perhaps one of Thatcher's few mistakes.
13985	Let's talk about the fantasy impact.	Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, was arrested last night
13986	I **never** do thattttt.	..... I hope you are joking
13987	People clearly missing the	That's the last fucking straw, he's out
13988	Glad she is teaching you to always rely on a man	My mom first let me go trick or treating just a few months ago. When I was 16. And that's only because my boyfriend was with me. When he's not with me somewhere, I can't go. :(
13989	hahaha yeah, we need more juggalos	Oh word. I was semi-quoting Kanye West. Though, Ill change it to ninjas
13990	The day after Sixth Sense came out, my sister calls me and says "I didn't know that Bruce Willis was gonna play a dead guy the whole time" Thanks sis...i believe that's what they call a plot twist!	(Spoilers!) What good part of a movie did someone spoil and ruin for you?
13991	Ignored and reported.	It blatantly sounds like you have no idea how to prevent a 15 minute baron. Correct me if I'm wrong.
13992	We got to experience his immaculate play too, don't worry.	Aaron Curry.
13993	I'm sold.	I'll bake u stuff and u can touch my butt
13994	Is not referred to as hooliganism - they are mostly referred to as fans of Philadelphia sports teams.	Why is hooliganism so rare in the US? Hooliganism connected to sports is common all over the world (Europe, Latin America, Russia, etc.), but it seems to be almost unheard of in the US. Why do you think that is? Rivalry between fans of opposing teams sure is vibrant in the United States, but you rarely hear anything about it escalating to violence.
13995	Maybe I should've added	I would much rather have Bogut than Monta right now. Monta would not have gotten better here unless maybe we traded Kid Curry, and fuck that shit.
13996	Jalen Rose the guy who intentionally tried to injure Kobe Bryant in the NBA Finals stating that the foul wasn't hard, I'm so shocked	Check what jalen had to say about the foul in his podcast.. he basically says it wasnt that hard of a foul. We are not talking about karl malone on isiah thomas here.
13997	Yeah, but recruiting rankings don't matter!	Every BCS Championship team except one (Oklahoma, 2000) has had at least one top ten recruiting class **1998: Tennessee** - #8 in 1996/7 **1999: Florida State** - top 5 '96-'98 **2000: Oklahoma** - #22 in '98, no top ten in the BCS era until #6 in 2001 **2001: Miami (FL)** - #9 in 2000, their 1999 class should have been but was criminally underrated **2002: Ohio State** - #2 in '99, #7 in '00, #5 in '02 **2003: LSU** - #2 in '01, #1 in '03 **2004: USC** - top 10 in '00/'01, #3 in '03, #1 in '04 *(greatest recruiting class on paper ever)* **2005: Texas** - #1 in '02 **2006: Florida** - #2 in '03, #2 in '06 **2007: LSU** - #2 in '04, #7 in '06 , #4 in '07 **2008: Florida** - #2 in '06, #1 in '07, #3 in '08 **2009: Alabama** - #10 in '07, #1 in '08, #1 in '09 **2010: Auburn** - #7 in '07, #4 in '10 **2011: Alabama** - #1 in '08/'09, #5 in '10 **2012: Alabama** - #1 in lol **2013: Florida State** - #10 in '10, #2 in '11, #6 in '12, #10 in '13 Sources: Rivals, Sports Illustrated
13998	Yeah thanks for that.	Headshots
13999	Sounds like a fun &amp; magical server to be on.	It's a cacophony of all the worst things the tf2 community has to offer - the people who play only to show off how expensive their hats are, the people who scream out funny tf2 memes, the people who attempt to create NEW funny tf2 memes, people who scream out "tryhard" if someone even thinks about pulling a trigger, admins enforcing fun, "friendly" classes, trolldiers that are allowed to kill you but you can't even bat an eyelash in their direction, people generally acting like morons in the chat, people who create some sort of unique personality in an attempt to stand out - All these on one server, every hour of every day: the happiest prison camp in the world.
14000	Because karma is important.	You're getting downvoted for bitching about downvotes.
14001	Maybe she was too nervous to pee	how the fuck was water going to help her? lol.

14006	Wait, we get free transfers?	Free Transfers Season 2. Where are you going? My rather small guild and I are deciding on whether or not we should transfer off our quite lack luster Sorrows Furnace to Crystal Desert, Henge, or NSP. Has anyone heard of any gossip going around to which of these servers is getting any notable influx of people? Of course I'm curious to where everyone else is intended on switching to,
14007	Correct - direct family members, I believe.	I think that they have to be relatives of the opponent, but I am not sure.
14008	Fucker!	Yeah, I think Mercola is one of the worst. Spreading anti-vaxxer lies and spreading AIDS denialism.
14009	Huh, I don't remember two redditors posting about visiting Silent Hill...	Gallery of "Two Redditors..." posts
14010	If it's a Star Wars hotel, how easy would it be to blow up?	Build scale replica starships from Star Wars and Star Trek. Run them as resort hotels/theme parks where you get to essentially take space vacations.

14012	YOU GOTTA DIE THE CAST FIRST GOD, LEARN HOW TO PLAY FIRST	The Rubicon has been crossed.
14013	I'm on the side that endorses negotiating peace in good faith.	Oh I wonder whose side you're on...
14014	Beautiful translation!	"Why would I tone down my outrageous behavior and lifestyle, when it's obviously so much fun and awesome!?" Or something similar.
14015	Yeah, she needs one of those super long ones made for sticking your whole arm into a cow's rectum.	Her glove is not nearly big enough to be sticking her hand in there.
14016	CHECK THE PECS	HUAH!
14017	I happened to have you RES-tagged with the link to your pic - probably from some thread a few months ago.	I'm glad you think so ;-) Did some digging?
14018	Kardashians, definitely want that	If you could have anything from the US what would it be? I'm doing an international gift exchange, the idea is to send a little taste of your country. The girl I'm paired with is from Australia and I have no ideas. It can be anything, food they may not have, products they may not have that you think they might find useful or cool, whatever. I apologize for you know, not being from Australia and posting here but I figured this would be a good place to ask. So, anything from my side of the globe you might be interested in receiving? Many thanks in advance.
14019	Well the efficiency of division of labor means that one person can't possibly do more on their own than they could do as part of a group.	How do you keep the self interest from overcoming the cooperation?
14020	I bought it for $500 so it basically didnt matter what happened to it.	Not a sustainable strategy, however.
14021	Your kind isn't welcome here.	cringefest
14022	It varies from state to state but generally yes.	Does the minimum wage for tipped employees go up along with the normal minimum wage usually?

14026	fucking mobile lol.	Who is this Dansby Mark?
14027	True, still it worked far too many times though, these same chicks will not hesitate to call some random dude who would actually try to speak to them in a regular car a creep though, which the guy in the lambo most certainly would be described.	They aren't going to leave in clips of chicks that don't get in
14028	Around here, we call it "knocking it loose."	Is it possible for sex to induce your period? SO and I had some mind-blowing sex and during I noticed that my period had started. It was not due yet for a couple days (I'm on the pill so it's SUPER regular). Did my BF bonk me into the future?? :o
14029	I tried one time using bitcoin to gild one other user but didn't know that it had a minimum amount.	Have you ever gilded someone else? Like someone commenting on one of your posts?
14030	Ray Hudson just walked in the room....but in all seriousness I really feel for him, seeing such an instinctive and clinical striker in his time go to something like this.	Guy couldn't finish if Kate Upton was blowing him. He needs to go somewhere and start fresh.

Hey guys so i'm trying to make some shirts with a graphic i designed that's really colorful. The problem is that most places won't print it because it has more than 10 colors. Any ideas of how I can print it on a shirt? Thanks for any Help!
14034	The question is: who is to blame in this scenario?	True fact: in 1995, the state of Pennsylvania agreed to give Verizon $2 billion (mostly in tax breaks) for delivering synchronous 45 Mbps speeds to all customers by 2015. The cost ended up being about $785 per household. Guess who's not going to deliver on their promises? Also, guess who's not going to jail for billions in fraud? If you guessed "Verizon," and "Verizon," then congrats, you are correct!
14035	I see, thank you.	It is a Google TV app and is not for mobile devices. As far as I am aware, Amazon still does not have an instant video app for devices outside its Kindle family.
14036	I know right, FM!	That's the kind of false equivalence that even the denizens of Wallmart can appreciate.
14037	God bless lifetime	Someone has been watching Lifetime again!
14038	That 60 FPS TLOU multiplayer.	What is the reason you bought a PS4? I'm curious as why most of yous bought a PS4, I bought mine because of The Last Of Us Remastered (Didn't have a PS3), The Order 1886, Bloodborne and basically the more gamer friendly approach Sony used in their marketing with the better console specs and fixed the problem of having a bad controller.
14039	Yah, cuz nobody ever discriminates against the jooz, right?	"I don't believe being Jewish is a race"
14040	That's great... I'm stealing that quote.	Makes sense to me. You know the old adage: "A misogynist is a man who hates women as much as women hate other women."
14041	That deck was so sweet, so much ramp	She was in dotp 2012. She also had eldrazi in her deck, which explains the zendikar connection.

14043	Thats what the god damn upvote button is for	This is the right answer.
14044	I can't tell if your joking or telling the truth...damn Australia	No, that's actually the dreaded 6 legged Aztrek spider, it's one of the smallest animals that can fatally envenomate a human, whose only known habitats are under toilet seat lids and under car door handles on the continent of Australia.

14046	Also lizard reptiles run my local supermarket.	There is a certain Race of people who suck people's blood. Can you guess which one?
14047	Beside the KILLING and such, this is exactly the same situation.	This tactic is also time-proven, it worked pretty well for the UK side in the upcoming Scottish referendum. The recent gains of the Yes camp are directly relatable to not sticking to it.
14048	%DV is based on daily 2000 caloric intake, the "average".	%DV is bullshit anyways. If I ate according to those recommendations I'd look like Christian Bale in the Machinist. All it takes is 10 minutes online and you know how much you need to eat to maintain a weight/level of good health that you want.
14049	or a Bugatti	It's moments like these I wish I was the Road Runner.

14064	Sudah makan malam?	Doing alright. Still in bed though. Gotta get up and make myself lunch soon.
14065	oh good thing the title was also spoiler tagged	It's almost as if you don't understand what the spoiler tag is there for. If you don't want to run the risk of having things spoiled for you, you just don't click things that are spoiler tagged. We are on a sub that has fans of both a show and a comic book that precedes it and is much further along. Inevitably, having a large community that encompasses both of those is going to cause some people to want to talk about things that others don't know about. In my opinion, those people shouldn't be completely unable to talk to each other about predictions based on comic knowledge or to draw parallels between comic and show simply because of the others in the sub that don't know everything they know. That is why we have spoiler tags, so comic readers can talk to each other without fear of ruining things for non-comic readers. If a non-comic reader decides to run the risk of clicking on something explicitly tagged as containing spoilers, then that's on them.

14071	Happy Cake Day biatch :p	I've got cogeco and a big nice unlimited 60mpbs.
14072	Now just think about it, because of your gender, you can masturbate in front of a random stranger AND make money off it!	I feel comfortable telling this now cause I feel there are enough comments that no one might ever see this. I was around 18 or 19 and had a day off from school and my parents were gonna be at work all day so naturally I planned on spending the morning polishing my pearl for hours. My plans were ruined when my mom reminded me that some dude was coming in the morning to appraise our house for mortgage purposes or some nonsense. She told me to get up cause he'd be there soon, and she left for work. Now I was already worked up and wet and super horny so I figured I'd just get myself off real quick on the couch while waiting for this bank dude. What I didn't know was that my mom had left the door unlocked and a note that basically said 'come on in' outside the house. Thankfully I was covered with a blanket when this dude walked in, but the picture he entered the house to was: me mid-orgasm and moaning and squirming around. I tried to play it off but I turned beet red and ran to wash all the juice off my hands. I then had to walk this man around my house for 20 minutes...all while still soaked and cringing in shame. I couldn't meet his eyes for even a second, but he was playing it kinda cool so I was hoping against hope he hadn't noticed. I realized he had...when he left, he wrote his number on the back of his business card. Tl;dr: I masturbated in front of a random stranger.
14073	Now the city will know who to send the clean up bill to.	Weird request, but maybe you can help? I was in Chicago a couple of weeks ago for a convention, and stuck a sticker on a pole at the northeast corner of S State St and E Congress Pkwy that says "Ron Maxwell Approved!" on it. If anyone could possibly let me know if that sticker is still there, that'd be great.

14075	TIL billion = 4	Jason Jason Jason Jason, hey guys I repeated his name a billion times where's my free karma?
14076	Cars should have required high visibility paint and spinning reflectors on the wheels	Don't forget to include "vests" under GREATER DRIVER AWARENESS. If they think we should have to play dress up to commute, they should, too.
14077	Fuck you, bitch-ass punk	Yeah mtg players on reddit seem significantly more civil than the rest of reddit for some reason.
14078	I'm sure they were given a fair trial.	Hamas has executed four Palestinian 'collaborators' since start of Gaza operation
14079	Yes, because the ENTIRE e-cig industry is blu, njoy, greensmoke, etc.	See ANTZ totally embarrass themselves by getting tied up in their own ignorance
14080	Indirect arachne buff.	The biggest problem I see is the current state of "stealing buffs." Basically, if you get the last hit on a buff an enemy was working on, they can't pick it up. (It becomes grayer and lies on the ground not being able to be picked up) So, if I was a counter jungler, I'd wait for the enemy to kill the buff monster, pick it up, then kill him. This pretty much breaks the method of stealing buffs.
14081	Because it's socialist.	What's Behind the Backlash to Houston's 'One Bin for All' Program
14082	FYI, in #4 the tall tree closest to you drops ashwood sticks when chopped.	There is a place on the map where there is one of every tree/bush in neat rows. Mapmaking leftover?
14083	90 years without slumbering...	"My Grandfather's Clock." I haven't heard that song in about 15 years, and I remembered it word-for-word as soon as I read "Grandpa's clock". "It was bought on the morn' on the day that he was born, And was always his treasure and pride, But it stopped short, never to go again, When the old man died."
14084	I'm sure many of these loopholes are unintentional	President Barack Obama says a loophole that lets companies dodge U.S. taxes by moving their headquarters overseas is unpatriotic.
14085	Isn't it the fact that Israel has such right-wing parties elected in the Knesset indicative of the general feelings of Israeli citizens towards Arabs and Islam?	Sure, quote one of the radical politicians in one of the most right winged parties in the Parliament and deduce that Israel is actually against Islam. Look, Israel is committed to ensure that Jews overseas will not be discriminated or threatened for being Jewish either by enhancing the security around places that are recognized with Jewish community or Jewish heritage, and sometimes even by helping the whole community to migrate into Israel when things gets out of hand like happened in most of th Arab countries in the middle east. Most of the hate toward Jews comes today from Muslims on account of what happens in Palestine, anyway, be sure that there is no intention to fight Islam itself.
14086	Maybe he was as surprised as we are.	I remember seeing a video a week or two back where the police chief in the area maintained that they had complete access and control to the area, seems as though he was lying.

14093	Nope, it makes you "fickle" for basing it off of one performance.	Am I allowed to criticize Santi and Giroud for playing like absolute shit now, or does that still make me not a "real fan"?
14094	And shockingly men don't mind watching it!	See also: Mad Men, which has a mostly-female writing staff and features some of the best female characters on TV.
14095	omg everyone should have called 911 and surrounded the person in a bubble of concern and empathy!	No, everyone in this thread is a medical professional and would immediately fix those seizures 1 2 3. So that means OP is rapist pedophile who is part of the WBC.
14096	Im just playing around :) although he is one of my favorite members, its sad he wasnt in that video either..	I've only done the ones that appear in the Diggy Diggy Hole video, but adding more is easy :)
14097	I pick a state park and find no roads, leaving the total road length in the US to 0 km.	Statistical sampling. You'll still need a fair amount of data for this, but it's still easier than measuring every single road. What you'll want to do is pseudorandomly pick a bunch of 1x1 mile squares and measure how much total road is inside them, then extrapolate that out to the full area of the US. Assuming that road density correlates with population density, you can make your statistical sampling more accurate by using a population density map to aid your selection of 1x1 mile squares, making sure you get an even cross section of the area of the US by population density. I would imagine that sampling 50 to 100 of these squares (assuming you weight them correctly by population density) will yield a reasonably accurate result, and would be practical enough to do with the aid of free, existing computer tools (no programming required) such as google maps. That is, just find your 1x1 square on the map and measure the length of all the roads in it.
14098	The trifecta of Starbucks, Cafe Breton and Cafe Havana in Greenbelt 3 hahahahahahahahahahaa	Where is your go-to tambayan in Makati? Mine is the starbucks in Jupiter st near MRT Buendia, mostly cause i can do a lot of reading there
14099	That's a definite possibility, but I really hope not.	I know, I'm just saying that things can get cut in 2 and a half years.

14109	Were they your neighbors?	As a non-whitie I found there to be several cons to living in south carolina when I was there.
14110	Thats a pretty fun game, we will definitely try it !	Hello Kitty Online is what you're looking for. Low spec and fun evidenced by over 700,000 fB likes
14111	Yeah, giving business a payment term for inventory generally is bad for the economy as a whole.	I personally don't agree with credit. Loans. Mortgages, lending people money before they have it. Doesn't work.
14112	Clearly big pharma controls who writes the history books just to sound more legitimate and scare us with history.	Was it overblown, or did the vaccination efforts prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic? We are awfully dismissive of the flu, but remember that the Spanish Flu of 1918 (an H1N1 virus, by the way) killed more people than WW1. Between 3% and 6% of the world's population died from it. More people died of it in two years than have died of AIDS. Ever. We can't even imagine death on that scale from disease now. Even if some of the seriousness is exaggerated, I don't think it is necessarily a bad thing. It probably does save lives, even if it's just a few from the normal flu.
14113	Because that'll be attacking job creators and making peoples lives harder because they gotta pay more for gas so they can sit idling downtown	Serious Question: Why doesn't Ontario implement a carbon tax just like BC to pay for transit upgrades or other green infrastructure? Although I think part of the reason their tax was so successful was the money was redistributed to people who needed it, so perhaps only part of the money goes to infrastructure.
14114	What elaboration are you looking for chief...	Just assumed OP wanted another opportunity to elaborate himself. (*I tried, OP!*)
14115	yeah, FUCK AIRBAGS!	Just another useless "safety" feature designed to push the price of cars ever higher and make them harder to keep up-to-date and work on yourself. Fuck these mandates.

14118	Good, I don't really like buying things from that overpriced asshole anyways lol.	I am not but I get asked a lot. I wonder if he gets asked if he is the R_Shackleford from Reddit a lot..
14119	Well we will always have that one microwave trick that Apple hates.	I see an article like this every so often about a game changing battery BUT it then never materializes... There's no way this will be in phones any time soon as it will likely have heating issues with moving that much power around PLUS it probably kills life-expectancy. I doubt such a battery will last years getting zapped like that.

14125	no no comrade, clearly bias.	people vote on the forums for the discounts they want to see the next day. Yesterday russians voted for the 50% on E3 and .com voted for something else. How is it russian bias? Today it's pretty much the same: .com voted for +40% RP gain for B-25, since it's everything that bothers the community probably. .ru voted for -30% on the german P-47. Each community gets what it has voted for.
14126	No they're black, so they obviously have criminal intent.	Wait, why is this creepy? There are two ways to look at it: A) They were attacking both cars potentially...or B) They were walking in a group somewhere, separated to let both cars pass, saw the Google car and had a good laugh chasing it and making it into Google Maps...
14127	Ya fuck that way of expressing plots!	Agreed. Anime is rubbish.
14128	No, stopping distances are shorter and visibility is better in 4WD.	People need to realize, 4 wheel drive is only good for helping you get going. It does absolutely nothing to help you stop or steer.

Kim: And these squares, what do they represent? Computer Guy: Those are our bases, and the flags represent which ones we think the Americans have targeted. *generals take note* Kim: I see. And this smiling face at the top in the sunglasses? Computer Guy: That's uuuuuuh, that's America. He's yellow because they fear us, y'know? Kim: Very well, continue.
14133	The human eye can't tell the difference between 30fps and 60fps.	Because you can't tell the difference between 720p and 4k on a 5" display

14139	I'm more disgusted by the food dish literally six inches away from the litterbox than I am by the state of the litterbox.	I'm surprised the cat(s) keep using that box. At that point they usually find somewhere cleaner to do their bidness.
14140	"Welcome to fucking reality, ya stupid mofo... ;)"	Holy shit, it IS contagious. Beard is just pissed because he has to accept that his choices (even though he didn't have the same level of choice in the matter that Crazy did) have limited his dating options.

14149	Im saying the entire premise of her post and then his response to it is a great example of how and then why some women feel uncomfortable kicking back and receiving pleasure.	To be fair, she did ask what she should do/act during oral. He said explicitly that it was from a guys perspective and what he likes.

14161	Sure is a good thing we don't have an income tax.	I'd love to hear a positive answer to this as well, but knowing KC their response would be something along the lines of "Congratulations on your good fortune of purchasing a property undervalue. Now pay me." I don't know what formula they use, but I've never received or heard of a land or structure assessment that wasn't over the market by several percentage points.
14162	I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's 26 for europe	I thought the dates were 23:USA 25:Rest of Europe 26:UK

14168	Game of Porns?	You sir are watching the wrong porn.
14169	No, it would probably try to kiss back.	Did you kiss it?
14170	I'd say it amounts to a mildly-worded letter, sent to the wrong address.	There is ZERO pressure in Israel. Have you seen what's happening in the U.S. Congress? Resolutions and laws passing with unanimous support for Israel, in complete denial about the reality of what's happening. The amounts to a 'strongly worded letter'...Complete kabuki theater while the carnage and weapon sales continue, unabated.
14171	In addition, the question might be asked, how was it that the US intelligence branches did not identify the operational weakness of the Iraqi military in those regions where they would not be able to hold on to either territory or their own arms ?	Maybe next time your troops shouldn't leave hundreds of millions of dollars in equipment that the US tax payers forked out so that you *can* protect your people that now happen to be in the enemies hands - literally.

14182	Anything up Highway 178 along the Kern River canyon past Kernville is nice.	Camping around Bakersfield? I'm new to California and I was wondering where you guys like to go camping. The ideal place would be up to a few hours away, a short hike to the beach, allows dogs, some amenities like a table and fire pit but not too fancy. Do you guys know of any campgrounds or websites that could help me with this? Thanks!

14184	The Eden Project is easily the most underrated artist on the scene.	The Eden Project's EP, Entrance, out on the 8th of October!
14185	Yes, because it's totally the job of the childless person to lie in order to make the other person feel more comfortable	If you have even the slightest ability to bullshit, you can say something like "eh we might have some in the future" or something like that. It's not difficult to work around a topic in conversation.

14193	Yeah, because not merging until the very last minute so you can get 1 or 2 more cars ahead isn't a dick move..	Just a merger on a highway.
14194	[The one with a clean face because he sees the other guy and thinks his face is dirty too?]	Two workers are working side by side on a scaffold. The scaffold collapses dropping the two workers, unharmed, into the dirt. After brushing themselves off they look at each other; one has a dirty face. Which one goes to wash their face?

14211	ITT no one has any faith in the italian justice system because they heard but couldn't bother to read on a story of 9 scientists... Its ok guys, hope you have some faith left in the american one.	Italian police have arrested two US soldiers from an army garrison in Vicenza, near Venice, over the rape of a pregnant woman.

14213	But why didn't they just tear gas them in the leg	Remember: Being a peaceful protester in a riot makes you a rioter, not a peaceful protester. It's not about what YOU are doing, it's about what the group as a whole is doing.

14215	I got an idea, lets push for stronger gun control/bans/confiscation to ensure they have all the firepower too	Also why you see such an effort to limit/control the internet. An open and free exchange of thoughts and ideas is a real problem for those pushing this propaganda.

14219	But my run of the mill color scheme that fits conventional color theory, that took $$$ to get right, anyone can apply a pattern nicely to an article of clothing, making the minamalstic simple pattern in Photoshop was the real work, not the actual practical application of it	Nothing is propitiatory about triangles. Does this artists think she was the first to draw god damn colored triangles?
14220	Thanks for providing that stellar source of yours!	You're wrong... you're facts are false. They will sue the shit out of a farm for even having 1 plant of theirs grow in their crops. So if a bird shits in their field, and a GMO corn grows with their regular corn... they will sue the farm so bad it will put them out of business. You either don't know your facts, or you work for Monsanto. Either way... you're wrong

14223	Yeah, even though when I do a side by side comparison, and it sounds different to me and people who don't know I have a sound card, it's a placebo.	Dat placebo is strong. I do have a sound card lying around, though it's a bit dated by now.
14224	Sure, Theon is much more deserving of compassion than Robin.	I don't really feel sorry for him nor for Joffrey, although they both are the result of terrible parenting. I cannot replace my empathy with sympathy like I have with Theon (who I resented more than Joffrey at CoK) Just look at Tommen, who had to grow up with psycho Joffrey in addition to a drunk, absent father and a batshit insane mother. He still managed to be a great kid, playing with kittens instead of spilling out their guts or letting them 'fly'.
14225	Because it's in a book.	If you keep making that face, it'll stick that way Instead of explaining to a young child that it's rude to make faces at people, we tell them "don't do that, or it will stick that way". We do this to control their actions, and make sure that they do what we want. If we use a lie to stop children from doing something so simplistic, then why is it so far fetch to think that Hell is any different?

14232	GTX 780	How do i make Civ 5 run smoother? It is such a pain to play Civ V on my computer. It IS playable but it's so annoying to play when the game lags everytime i move around. It also crashed on me when i was close to winning.
14233	Because I can hear your tone as well as I can see your face over the internet.	Its a joke....
14234	har har har, The 'murican business community has opted out with their money, all stashed off shore and tax free.	The Agony of Frank Luntz - "The politicians have failed; now it's up to the business community to stand up and be heard," he tells me. "I want the business community to step up."

14237	Because quantum theory	Serious question here, then why do cata purr when they rub up against someone willingly?
14238	You forgot: Comes with a DNA sequencer so you can comply with AML laws.	An interesting idea, but I think if I was going to make an ATM I'd want a machine that: * Is a thin client for a server (allowing monitoring, setting exchange rates, rotating wallets, etc) * Has a touchscreen interface * Handled Canadian and American money * Could accept Bitcoin and dispense cash * Has a secure shell design that would make theft difficult * Comes with the option to handle multiple altcoins * Diverts a transaction fee to a third address Obviously, that'd be well beyond what this machine is meant to do, which is play with the basics. Maybe such a project should be funded by the Bitcoin community... it would certainly speed adoption if every corner store and coffee shop could have a small box made for a few thousand that would sit on their counter, handling small Bitcoin transactions and collecting 1% in each direction...
14239	If you vomit you'll have room for that candy.	This guy was older than my Dad. His PM caused a legit desire to vomit.
14240	Yeah; sharing the fun things you and your friends do is definitely not something to be done, I totally agree.	This is the type of stuff you don't have to share with ppl :-/ The gels are rly neat; but apart from that, the whole slideshow had a forever alone vibe... sorry xD
14241	Because all of those celebrities were born into celebrity and none of them earned it.	Everyone who made one of those "It Gets Better" videos was lying and we should fix this with violence.
14242	But were you subhuman scum at the time?	My baby was in neonatal, could see her any time of the day or night.
14243	I _love_ how the show at a 16+ theater is 18+ :) Thanks!	Haywyre Two Fold Tour
14244	Although it is a common misconception that abc caused the xyz affair, it was actually the meddling French.	Canadian here: Not much. First of all, we don't have a class called "history" in the public system at all. Instead, it's "Social studies" - Basically, it's a class on politics and history, combined into one that runs for all 12 years of public school. It covers everything from Ancient Greece in elementary to how the Canadian government works today. There were "Canadian History" 'units' in Social Studies', but we never once had a course in public school dedicated to history. We briefly discussed how the US political system is different from ours, but not in much detail. I can't name any more than a few US presidents. I think I know the names of all the states but that's just raw exposure over time. We never talked about them other than the "13 colonies". Like many others here, 99% of our US lectures were similar to how we were taught about, say, Germany in WW2: General "xyz happened because of abc" stuff. Not much detail. Christopher Colombus was very briefly mentioned in elementary: "He discovered America in 1492". That was is. No mention of how Thanksgiving worked or anything like that. We have Thanksgiving in Canada but it's very different from the American version. Years later, that was replaced with "Vikings discovered it ages before Colombus" and Colombus was never mentioned in school again. Let's see.... Slavery, Martin Luthor King, all of that...never really discussed at all. Civil war - not discussed at all. War of 1812....Not really at all. The Alamo and all that - not discussed at all.
14245	Go back to Tumblr where you belong.	Isn't it obvious??? And BTW Whatsup with the strikethrough on the word friend? Are you saying just because someones gay they cant be your friend unless you are gay? Wow lot of homophobes on reddit today. Maybe I shouldve stayed outdoors.
14246	A little advice, dont eat mandrakes.. theres like, 5 per world and there extremely valuable	Need some advice about pain I'm currently playing as Willow, around day 45. At about day 35 I think I got attacked by a mosquito (I'm assuming that's what it was, I was running through the forest at dusk and suddenly reacted to an attack - kept running and nothing followed). I went back to my camp, ate some berries and a mandrake to get back to full health, ate some crock pot stuff to get full hunger and sanity. Despite being completely fed, healthy and sane, the screen was still tinged with red and I had to spend two nights sleeping to get it back to normal. Do any of you lovely people have any idea what the hell happened there? Was that just the game taking a while to catch up with itself? I thought that once I was back on full health the red stuff would go away. Is there a reason why it didn't?
14247	I'd also tell her about a lot of the things that science doesn't know and how God could be the explanation for all of those things.	Maybe you could explain that we don't know what happened before the Big Bang, and it could very well have been God that set it in motion? She can still believe in God, as there are so many things that seem to come down to chance, or divine intervention thingy. But this way she can realize that God simply may not have had as great an impact as she thought. Just make sure you tell her about how cool dinosaurs are at least :D
14248	TPB, how I love you both...	Me after cracking open a bottle of Sailor Jerry after delicious beers after work

14253	Nope, I didn't even know about the whole Twitter thing, but the reason he got fired is who used a Wii in some sort of car tire commercial, and Sony wasn't very happy about that.	They fired him for that?
14254	You don't have to have an ID to buy a gun or to express your opinion.	There was mention of the first and second amendments in there
14255	Cayman, Boxter or Cayenne: Laugh 911, Panamera or Carrera GT: Cringe	They had to tear apart a Porsche because a fat person got stuck in it... I don't know whether to laugh or cringe.

14260	I've almost kinda stopped wearing makeup when I go over my boyfriend's, because (TMI time here) even waterproof mascara won't last through a blowjob.	My boyfriend (this is before we were together though, which makes it a lot worse) was comforting me about something, and I started crying onto his shoulder. It turns out I just smeared all my eye makeup on his pure white shirt that he had just bought that same day. Also on a kind of NSFW context, sometimes I do his makeup and then we have kinky times, and one time afterwards, I realized my lips were completely concealed from his foundation.
14261	It's already the most popular sport in the world - not sure it needs to grow necessarily.	Those people? The ones whose only exposure to the sport is clips of diving? They're the ones that have to be won over to grow the sport.
14262	Or, it could be that "slaying in the spirit" is nonsense.	Just wondering here: When there are people being slain in The Spirit there are usually people around to catch them. Why don't the people who catch them also get slain? Are they somehow resisting The Spirit's presence?
14263	They're smoking the edibles dude.	I quote this video with my friend so much, "you know my bong is 6 feet deep" is my favourite.

14275	Good, I have always said that the public has no business knowing what's going on in public buildings.	After cop's viral Obama rant, town seeks ban on videos inside public buildings
14276	I assumed those nazis were in the genocide category	And Chelski fans
14277	He probably went to Thailand.	The Swedish paedophile who wanted to adopt a child has left the country with child.
14278	If OP doesn't take you up on his offer, I guess I will..	I have one, but never use it. Why? For one, it's all plastic. Makes me a bit uncomfortable. Also, one of the insulated lids started to come apart after only a few dishwasher washings. Two, all assembled, it's a bit too big to carry around comfortably. I commute by bicycle to work, and it's a pain to carry in my bag. I tend to use either Mason jars (healthier glass, but gotta make sure I don't get cut in case I go down and the glass breaks) or glass storage containers with tight-closing lids. Finally, it's got a lot of small parts, and I just don't need all those containers for lunch; nor do I have the time to put them all together with food, take them all apart, etc. So who's it ideal for? Perhaps someone who commutes by car, likes to have a large-ish lunch with both hot and cold food, someone who wants to prepare a meal with TLC for a loved one (wife? daughter or son?) for the day. Want mine? I'll send it to you. Free (U.S. only. No kidding.)

14285	Bro if you don't leave you will be just as crazy as her.	she is self absorbed and likes to be called princess and even calls herself princess at times. she has the word princess in wooden cutout letters above her bed. on her high manic episodes of when she is happy and in a good mood she jokes and says shes amazing looking and has even admitted to MASTURBATING IN FRONT OF A MIRROR SHE SHE THINKS SHE LOOKS SO HOT. like fuck man its so hard to admit and i just know in my head i should but since i am currently in a weak part of my life with living at home for 1 year and going to a uni she is giving me hope. she makes me laugh and i love her .. ive always been more into the crazy type because they to me are interesting and not boring. i am known to be a goofball at times but have some great friends and i know i am weird sometimes but it isn't anything that is not really weird or would make me awkward by any means. i have a self destructing issue where if im happy ill run away from it, and now that i have her i told myself she makes me happy so i wont self sabotage. maybe that plan has back fired and i really DO have a reason to leave and its not me.
14286	I approve!	Completely by accident too!
14287	You mean foreigners don't also base their knowledge of Scotland on the far more historically accurate Rob Roy?	A Hollywood movie that tends to be the only base of reference many foreigners have for their country's history and culture - appearing to be *generally* factual, but with some hugely glaring misinformation that could very easily give the watcher the completely wrong impression of our country's history. You have *no* idea how many Americans have just about zero exposure to Scottish culture other than Braveheart. It permeates pop culture references to our country, so it's frustrating that so much of it is bollocks.
14288	Yeah, I mean look at Canada it's a despotic wasteland of hellfire and death, guess that's what you get for having one of the most multicultural countries on earth.	Multiculturalism does not work, as every single nation in the history of the planet that has tried it will prove . You simply cannot mesh cultures with completely opposing ideas regarding truly basic human rights.
14289	Aren't you glad we passed the bill before we know what was in it	This was all disclosed during open enrollment. The ACA is a means tested program and making more results in paying more of the premiums. It's far less severely means tested than many other programs in that regard. The cost sharing means tests are more worrisome because they're cliffs that can change a $0 deductible plan into a $500 or $1000 deductible by crossing a magic number. The difference between a plan making 199% of FPL and 200% can be quite significant when it comes to actually paying for your care. I never have seen clarification on what happens if your estimate and realized modified adjusted gross income span one of those cliffs.

14296	That's a very positive way to view the situation.	The game is gonna get worse and worse, and everybody is gonna tell you to just suck it. If the player base didnt love it that way we could talk about alternative formats, but nah...
14297	Fire Goodell	For the third consecutive season, there is a tie in the NFL. Mike Nugent missed wide right to give the Bengals and Panthers a 37-37 tie. In 2012, the 49ers and Rams tied, and last year the Packers and Vikings tied.

14299	If you've got nothing to hide, then why don't you want a cavity search?	No worries, I noticed :) That "escalation of truisms" is a scary thing, though. You start with "less terrorism is better than more terorism, mkay?" and end up with anal probe traffic stops.
14300	# Blame User	Please can everyone stop blaming Tucker. He played how he felt he should have played. If it's anyone's fault it's mine, I could have TP'ed Tucker away and had them fight. But I felt that that would not have been very fair.

14306	Yeah you should give them up for adoption because you can't take care of them.	people who can't afford food shouldn't be having a kid much less multiple offspring. keep it in your pants romeo.
14307	Right, because my issue with food stamps was that people were faking eligibility.	Less than 1 percent of food stamps go to ineligible people
14308	Bethesda is doing nothing more than requiring you to pay a monthly subscription for their service, same as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc..Microsoft is the one saying in order to access those services that you're already paying for mind you, through your Xbox you have to have Xbox Live.. it's a dick move and one thankfully Sony is not mimicking..and I don't know if the numbers have increased with the Xbox One (likely so, i'm guessing) but the last time I looked up 360 users with Xbox Live it was only around half.	This is Bethesda requiring you to pay not Microsoft. Besides who has a xbox but not xbox live.

14314	The Nazi'd have clearly become the Nazis, amirite?	*literally* Hitler.
14315	A 6 thousand dollar plan on 30 grand should qualify you for subsides, though.	That is all nice, but the truth is that people can **still** go into bankruptcy with these new plans. The deductiles and other out of pocket expenses for an individual on most plans are over $6,000 where I live. People who are making less than $30,000 a year could still easily be forced into bankruptcy over that if they don't have people to help out. Let's face it, you can't afford to give up a fifth of your yearly income at that level and still have enough to pay for basic necessities. I am sure there are some people who will benefit now that there are not limits on coverage, but it really doesn't go nearly far enough. In fact, the higher deductibles could actually be worse for some people than their previous plans. It is a very complex thing.

14321	Can't let the press have first-hand experience on the thing they're their to report on.	As I understand it, they have areas for the press to ensure they won't be grouped in with looters, rioters and protesters, and so they won't be inadvertently affected by whatever the police elect to use for crowd dispersal. The press is electing to leave those areas so they are not being treated like the press. The police are not targeting the press, they are trying to control a situation that is out of control and the press arguing they have a right to be there is not smart and does not help the situation.

14333	If they really cared they would lobby our government to give tax dollars to this organization.	It's like a corporatist's version of "I'm not racist, I have a black friend!": it's so fucking blatant and insincere, but they're so disconnected from reality and humanity that they can't see it.

I went to Parris Island twenty years ago and tried identifying myself as "secular humanist" - holy shit did that piss some people off.

14359	And while we're at it, penalties where the taker fakes to shoot in one side and shoots in the other shouldn't count because it puts the GK off.	It's hard to tell if there is any contact from that angle but even if there wasn't it still should have been a penalty. Sticking out your leg to fake a foul is still enough to put a player off. But yes, he also dived to emphasise the foul.

I'm just as critical of Israel as anyone else, and my post history proves it, but there are too many stupid fucks on reddit that are polarized and I'm honestly beginning to think that it's because of antisemitism. Why don't we start discussing some of the PLOs crimes and support of wars in the rest of the middle east? There's a reason no one likes the palestinians. Even if they aren't terrorists themselves, they still largely support their actions.

14370	Stop rationalizing it, they obviously are working with the NSA to spy on us.	Viewing statistics maybe?
14371	He forgot	any new evidence of such?
14372	Dana didn't create that weight class because he didn't want cyborg in the ufc, he's just trying to keep her down.	Honestly, I thought "the weight class you want to fight at doesn't exist in the UFC" was a pretty legitimate reason.
14373	It's not like personal finance should be rsomething your parents teach you.	An even bigger problem is that the education system that we currently have is preparing people to be workers, rather than business owners or people that are attuned to the global economy. Apart from the obvious failures, there is no value that is placed upon entrepreneurship or personal finance which are skills that are needed to drive the future. Oh, and let's not forget the Creationism bullshit.
14374	"It's Not the bike it's the rider."	Might as well take off those knobby tires because that low exhaust isn't going offroad.
14375	Looks like it needs to be hit with a DA polisher and some M105...	Please for the love of all things that are holy: Remove the papyrus font from the sidebar title. Every time I see it my eyes start bleeding. It is a font that should be only be used when parodying itself. Change it to something else (sans Comic Sans) such as webdings or IMPACT (this is only slightly better) but the papyrus just ruins everything. Thank you for your time, I will be cleaning up the blood from my face due to font induced ocular bleeding.
14376	many a story that have been true have not seen the light of day with mainstream sources.	Then there will be an article by 100 real news sources; BBC, Sky, Rueters, AP, CNN, NYtimes, Washington Post, USA Today, Al Jazeera...where are they?
14377	Yes i want AAP	People want AAP back in power: Arvind Kejriwal - Hindustan Times
14378	Tapdancing cowboy legs	The Evil Characters symbol in LOTR Trivial Pursuit has us stumped... Any one able to figure out what it is supposed to be?

14381	They look like balloons about to pop.	Her boobs look painfully sore
14382	FIFA said Boston is on the shortlist to replace Qatar and to get ready	The US was second in voting, so I'm crossing my fingers we get it instead! If not, then I hope the Aussies get it
14383	It's not necessarily wrong, it's just misleading since it's not that simple.	Rich people are not "job creators", it's a bullshit term.
14384	yea that's her mainly weakness imo	indeed the spellvamp is quite huge and the tool that can keep her in lane. but before 75stacks u just get bullied around so hard..
14385	I couldn't believe no one else had said the same thing before I did.	Dag yo you are comment karma rich off this comment!!! This is by far the highest rated comment I've ever seen on this subreddit.
14386	No, just the bald ones.	Are all bald people angry?
14387	Prohibition is an affront to individual liberty, a cornerstone of a functioning democracy.	If Marijuana was legal but alcohol wasn't, what would be some arguments for legalizing booze? People always have tons of reasons for legalizing Marijuana, but what arguments would people make for legalization if alcohol was illegal and weed was legal?
14388	High tech hacker skillz allowed me to unblur the image.	How did you know what those words were, they blurred them out!
14389	Georgia Southern Eagles	What's your favorite team nickname, besides your own? Picking a different team that shares your team's nickname isn't allowed either.
14390	yeah, remember back when people weren't reposting faggots?	The golden age of racism. They just don't teach it like they used to.
14391	Now sit on it	Eyy!!

14395	Same Old Thing	Bummed to see no old songs besides I Got Mine.
14396	Modern art is bad because it makes me have to consider subtle themes about myself and society instead of being a pretty picture.	Taken from the front page of r/videos. "Why is modern art so bad?"
14397	Yeah, try steel wool.	I wouldn't use anything as abrasive as a toothbrush. Probably just a soft cloth to spot clean where needed. Rain isn't really going to cause you problems, I wore mine out in the rain. The main problem is scratches and scuffs. Be careful about what you brush up against and what you lean on while you're wearing it. It's a jacket that is meant to be worn, it's going to get idrty and it's going to get a little bruised. Don't worry too much about it, because it's going to happen no matter what.
14398	Adding an injured center and a cheeseburger munching fatty does not make you a contender.	TRASH TALK THREAD: THE MODS HAVE ACQUIRED 4 ALL STARS IN FREE AGENCY, ALL YOUR POSTS WILL NOW BE REMOVED **FUCK THE HEAT, NO SERIOUSLY, ITS SO HOT HERE**
14399	Wouldn't Hitler himself consider Indians inferior?	because he was a strong leader or some shit of all the strong leaders... Hitler?
14400	Along with the "slut" factor and social stigma or whathaveyou.	They are, but there are several things preventing that from happening. The specter of pregnancy is enough for many women to be deterred from casual sex, the pill decreases libido for many women, many women have vibrators, etc.
14401	You equate taxation with totalitarianism?	You seem to have confused socialism with totalitarianism.
14402	looks legit	Apparently they found a mermaid on Galveston...
14403	Climate change is more due to cow farts	Oh great, someone who believes human-induced climate change is a myth. THAT's who we want promoting Bitcoin...
14404	Good in theory, but at my college they specifically require .docx.	.PDF
14405	Ask again in 2020 please.	Reddit, what are the biggest news events of the decade?
14406	Bacon Bird sent!	Deposited a lvl 13 yellow Flabebe. Getting Omega Ruby. IGN: Kelvin. Thanks! :3

14408	Is the ALG Combat worth it?	Word.
14409	Brings a new meaning to DVDA	My SO's Anti-vax mother, everyone.
14410	It all depends on where you live and who you know.	Shit. First of all those prices are whack. $50 a quarter $60 tops for killer. $25 an eighth and $10 a gram. Second of all he probably didn't want to say gram because he already said g and when you asked him to clarify he got sketched our because that's heat bag....but then again posting it on reddit seems even less low key....yolo?
14411	Chop down christmas tree with melee for sweet, sweet certs.	Use for sticky nades, and anyone who is killed by having an ornament hung on them turns into a Christmas tree upon death
14412	Maybe they should have paid for the "fast lane."	This monster here tried to go comment. Seems like the FCC servers don't have the bandwidth to handle the amount of comments they're getting. Irony?
14413	Just take a look at all the blood in Colorado	If marijuana is legalized, John Mica warned at a recent congressional hearing, there will be blood.
14414	Klug.	Slight damage card want to alter. I just got a geist of saint traft that's a little banged up on a corner. Anyone know a good reliable place to send for a alter/extend boarder?
14415	Oh no, there goes all the credibility and dignity of the USAF because one dude forgot his fucking US pins...	So only civilians watch television now? And last I checked AFN plays the Today show so we're talking thousands of military members who saw this from around the world.
14416	There's only one way to enjoy a brace of coneys...	Thanks Samwise Gamgee, I always enjoy your cooking tips.
14417	Lel.	Again. We don't do that. We stick to our sub. If I told you I had 14 Ph.Ds, would you just believe me? Or would you stop and think for a fucking second to realize that anybody can run into your sub and claim to be a Kings fan (like, oh, idk... a ducks fan?) and then talk some abhorrent shit to make us look bad? Yeah maybe fuck off was a bit over the top. But I really don't care. I hate your cheating, dirty fucking team so whatever.
14418	You and who else?	Sigh... I promise that some people in Texas are intelligent (speaking as a person who lives in Texas).
14419	Your generalizations are totally accurate!	iPhone owners are traditionally the superiority minded. You guys know Apple could not make their screens break as easily if they wanted to right?
14420	All black rappers are lil wayne or kanye anyway	I love how he changes the station and *as if by magic*... a hated artist!
14421	Yeah supporting your allies IS money well spent.	Money well spent...
14422	Ooooo-laaaaaa!	The chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one but still they come!
14423	They were rescued by an army of twitter hash tag.	That reminds me, what ever happened to those Nigeria girls?
14424	Are we going to have a 1000 trooper manhunt for them too?	Brothers charged in Harrisburg homicide spotted in car with victim minutes before shooting, police say.
14425	So accepting for a moment your (clearly ridiculous) premise that no one is killed, what you're suggesting is that the Middle East needs 9million new refugees?	I'm not implying anything other than what is explicitly stated, the destruction of Cairo. Whatever you want to infer from it is on you.
14426	What, you don't like 4 cents for a 6 month old game?	I would do it! Better than Gamestop.
14427	"Did they send me Taillows, when I need Ho-ohs" This is really awesome, but I think the cat is from Yu-gi-oh.	I'll make a Mon out of you
14428	You're wrong because many companies have a 'harassment policy' that this violates, likely including your own.	I have, each and every one of them. It isn't "Harassment." It might violate company policy, but that doesn't make it harassment. Lot's of things violate company policy without meeting the strict definition of the actual word that is used. Harassment has a VERY specific meaning in the English language. It includes persistent or repetitive. Even the EEOC requires that it be "severe or pervasive."
14429	It's pronounced "thirty-nineth"	Siri also says, "Ceaser Eeee shavez..."
14430	And yet, here we see the sock puppetry in action.	Lellux has 1+ year as a redditor

14432	I know, how can you be alone in a relationship?	GASP! traitor~
14433	Because anal sex, duh	Apparently gay people love poop. It's not even that they're all scat fetishists, they just really like feces. What?
14434	Defensive perk is OP	167 hp? - Random panic in classic mode.
14435	Wow gee isn't this the funniest fucking thing?	Testing out my Tina Belcher Halloween costume. Euuuhhhhhhhhhh
14436	I agree with them FPS are saturated like COD clones.	FPS and settings are too tiresome.
14437	Clearly my daughter needed saving from the evil boob.	I hope you ripped that person a new asshole, because in no way shape or form is it OK to snatch an infant out of ANYONE'S arms unless the infant is in worse danger from that person. WTactualF?
14438	YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH	This is one kick ass antibiotic!
14439	Yeah I called up my friends at the NSA and they hacked your PC and fixed it for me, BTW you have some fucking weird shit in your history.	While I was reading your answer, the download started from 0 to 76mb and then completed, but really thanks anyway.
14440	Good riddance.	Justin Bieber -- I'm Done with Los Angeles
14441	Not Letterman?	For me, this is the greatest source of Hoosier pride
14442	Yes because simplifying it as "armor" means theres only one set to choose from, just like void	And then it would be only people in armor. Going from 1 viable option to a different 1 viable option is not increasing the variety.
14443	Nah bruh its bc there sick and they depress and drugs=medicine but da government hates us so they make drugs ilegal man	cause they're dumb shits
14444	Brb in a fetal position in the corner of the room crying.	It tickled
14445	Raiden from Mortal Kombat would be amazing	If this had Neku Sakuraba and raiden then it would be my personal perfect roster.
14446	Because restaurants are such great moneymakers?	Haha. No kidding. It must be hundreds of meters from that other cactus club. I need it. I had lunch in that building once a while back when I did a co-op with the coast guard. It would be a great spot for a restaurant. Why don't the coast guard people serve food during the down time to cover the costs.
14447	It's almost like allowing human adults to make their own choices is a good idea, or something!	Colorado Sells $19 Million in Cannabis in March: $1.9 Million Goes to Schools and Crime Down 10%
14448	If you know what you're doing, you're not going to a place without fucking squat racks.	When they say "judgment," they mean "intimidation." It's actually a great place if you're just starting out and looking for somewhere where people who are also just starting workout. Also, at least compared to LA fitness, it's not as crowded, there's just as much (if not more) equipment, and there's no staff pressuring you to add extra shit onto your membership. If you know what you're doing, or what you want to accomplish, it's a good place to go. If you want someone to hold your hand through your workout, keep looking.
14449	So you lost 2/3 games?	We only ever lost to Dortmund and PSG, haha!
14450	Yeah, let's make brash judgments about people without knowing anything about them!	You're obviously not doing NoFap to remove misery from your life. This speaks to the damaged men on here, such as myself, who have hurt themselves nearly beyond full repair of their psyche, personal relationship(s), and even body.
14451	But abstinence only education has worked so well in America...	I may have worded incorrectly but I did mean still ban the adverts, just have some way of educating the public in replacement of the adverts.
14452	Yay!	Facebook acquisition of Oculus VR now official!
14453	Wait, so Britain has actually been a Communist state since the 1950's then, well I rather like communism in that case	Yes but to (some) Americans communism is defined by if a country has universal healthcare and some kind of Welfare state.
14454	Silly, that implies there were other bad things to the Holocaust.	It's as they say: the worst part about the holocaust is that it never happened.
14455	How about next year you let her pick the custom instead of parading her.	Me and my daughter won.
14456	yes this bug happens sometimes where the dropped weapon's picture doesn't show up, it's pretty common	This just happened
14457	She obviously just wants to get into your pants.	Person is obviously not reading my profile? I was messaged by a girl a few days ago who seems very nice. We've exchanged a few messages, but she's asking me questions that make it very obvious she's hasn't really read my entire profile, such as asking me what TV shows I watch when I explicitly stated them. What do you generally do in this situation? Politely call her out on it? Just respond with the same thing I put in my profile? The conversation has been interesting enough that I don't just want to drop her and move on.
14458	^ ^ ^ Found the racist !	Uh no. Having more conservative political views doesn't make you a bad person. People are allowed to believe in whatever the fuck they want.
14459	Maybe we'll luck out and that will get delayed for a few years.	A big closure will be for Eglinton station for the construction of the Eglinton Crosstown. The platform has to be moved 70 meters north to better align with the new LRT. 52 closures over 2 years, probably 2017-2018. (every other weekend)
14460	Sadly that thread is gone... Many tears were shed.	Yeah if someone could just direct me to Aubrey Plaza from the last thread that'd be great
14461	The title only says bucket.	The chicken...
14462	All those kids must have been sociopaths.	Yikes! I grew up in southern Mississippi, on the coast. I would agree the south is bad for this sort of thing; but I've gotten pretty far north to discover it's bad here too. I remember being horrified in third grade when kids would catch lizards and put them in those giant A/C units outside of the school.
14463	Lol dyslexia isn't real, you're just too dumb to read	I hate this whole "If you don't read your stupid" thing. FFS, I have a different hobbies. Also, I have dyslexia so reading for long periods of time is just frustrating for me.
14464	Kanye's going to be pissed when he learns that Shakespeare has used more words than him.	Hip hop vocabulary
14465	Real men use V8s... as fuel pumps!	If you read into the engine layout of this thing I think you'll find it uses a Cosworth CA2010 F1 V8 engine just to pump the fuel into the rocket.
14466	everybody knows that anything that is black is at least 10X more deadly	Also black increases the ability to kill people by at least 10x
14467	I'll take men seriously when they stop acting like their stereotypes.	Men are a minority, why do we even act like they exist?
14468	probably just mad a spur didn't win	That makes a little more sense, but then if that's the case maybe it shouldn't be called teammate of the year..
14469	Wasn't there also 2 Robert Griffins at the 2012 draft?	Running back Adrian Peterson was drafted at #199. Just not that one.
14470	Well obviously you're not sending him nudes that's what's wrong with you	...but...but sometimes the toilet paper shreds after *I* take a shit. What am I doing wrong with my life?
14471	Totally.	like taking pictures of yourself in swimsuits.
14472	naw her ass hits the floor.	Considering how short Putin is, he'd probably have to step on a pedestal to smack her on the ass.
14473	Any similarity to any story I've ever heard of is automatically bad	IMO, That doesn't explain how it would drag the story down, since we don't know how it will be revealed and what the consequences will be.
14474	Psh, no it doesn't that's just the patriarchy backfiring.	Sexism often does swing both ways. People tend to forget that.
14475	*Micro$oft*, amirite guyz?	sudo apt-get install mysql Fuck Microsoft!
14476	But breaking the law and ruining a kid's life is worth it to get those society-destroying psychedelics off the streets!	A guy I knew a while back had his house raided for drugs (psychedelics). They didn't really know exactly what they were looking for, they just heard he had it from someone. Well, they didn't find it despite it being in plain sight, so they planted some cocaine on him. THEN they found the drugs they were looking for sitting in plain sight on the counter, and they charged him with both.
14477	oh boy!	Only 138 days until we get to do this again...
14478	Yeah, OP, way to take that hint and ruin it by putting a bunch of thought into and and trying to deliver exactly what she wanted but even better.	If she MENTIONED that she wants a Super Nintendo then that's what she really wants.
14479	Yep, drunk driving is hilarious.	^^^I ^^^think ^^^his ^^^antics ^^^are ^^^fucking ^^^hilarious.
14480	2015 is our year don't worry.	Yeah, and for the second straight year we'll be relying on freshmen all over the place. I'm ready to have a team that isn't young any more!
14481	not sure if	Quiet, you. I'm trying to be pissed about the game being literally impossible to play in any fashion over here.
14482	A man with class.	So, my neighbour has this licence plate...
14483	Just what we needed.	Hitch on Berglund, "He's Out".
14484	Somebody needs to get laid... [me too]	Basescu: "Am schimbat pupitrul dupa ce m-am intors la Cotroceni, dupa ce l-a dezonorat un maimutoi ca Antonescu"
14485	Only people with tiny boats say that though	It aint all about the size of the boat, it's about the motion in the ocean.
14486	Fuck you for thanking someone on reddit!	Thank you!
14487	don't be silly only middle east countries are Muslim.	The countries with the largest Muslim populations are Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Egypt. Only Pakistan and Egypt are included in this poll. Also, Morocco, Algeria, Nigeria, and Iran all have larger populations of Muslims than Lebanon and Tunisia. I understand why Saudi Arabia was included in the survey, but I absolutely do not understand why countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Morocco, and Iran were left out.
14488	"hey she's not replying, she must be a creeper!!!"	Stop Creeping
14489	Fuckin' choker.	No no no haven't you read he's the problem?
14490	Of course, he's a Republican!	Nah, Rand Paul is a real scumbag.
14491	What, not that single episode of Angel?	Jeremy's breakthrough movie has got to be Hurt Locker. He had a big role in SWAT but that was a pretty cookie cutter role.
14492	Don't you mean "clip"	Up vote for you. I came here to say just that. But to many not in the gun culture, every bullet is a hollow point just like every magazine fed rifle is an AK-47.
14493	They will probably never get a replacement unit.	Vertical Xbox One spotted at 343 Industries
14494	Plot twist... It wasn't the same guy	Good 'Samaritan' Backfire
14495	yeah, totally surprising damage, exactly the same situation as Mathil	Dear Mathil, this is how you hardcore &amp; live.
14496	Ya DC wins all the events.	Batman and his family when at all of the wrestling, and fighting events. I guess Aqua man, if not disqualified wins all the swimming events. Dick Grayson wins all of the gymnastic events. I want to say in any winter events, Dr Freeze has an advantage because he wont be weighed down with all of the gear that others need to keep them warm.
14497	I've had bosses drop those consumables that you use for 10 minutes bonus glimmer for killing their race	Strikes and bosses Do bosses never drop anything? I've never gotten anything from the bosses in the strikes. Strikes don't feel rewarding enough. I've only gotten to the level 20 strikes. Does this change the higher you go? It's a great feeling to kill a boss and check the phat loots you got. :)
14498	I like your drone folders	Going it solo in a VNI with 5M SP.
14499	What makes you assume that he's on the same tier or that there isn't another reason matter manipulation would work on Beerus?	The real advantage SS had in fights against opponents like Superman was not in power output or durability, but that he has matter manipulation. However, SS's matter manipulation abilities seems to stop working when he is fighting someone who is on the same tier as him or higher in Marvel's cosmic hierarchy, which usually results in a slugfest and they shoot energy beams at each other and such. This is where Beerus gains the advantage, especially when he has 100% of his full power, as opposed to only 70% in his duel against SSJG Goku.
14500	Anything listed by Atlus, Capcom, Level-5, Shin'en Multimedia, or Nicalis are worth a look.	What do you recommend from the list of games listed?
14501	So jealous	Or Tennessee, we have Barrett and a new Beretta factory coming here.
14502	Yeah, I'm planning on running a free float rail.	Have you considered mid-length on a 14.5"? It seems to be the new fad these days. In either case, you'll probably want a low profile gas block and run a free float rail. I've got a Midwest Industries on mine and am pretty pleased with it.
14503	No super tanks is a rule for reason as there is a whole lot more than just this thing out there	Can we get this as a Prototype West German TD Eugene pls
14504	I'd download a car	If you could break any law and know you could get away what would it be?
14505	there is also a setting in windows which is different	Mine's in my BIOS, you should check yours. My Mobo is an Asus Z87.
14506	Time will tell and I hope my perceptions are wrong but your reply does not invalidate my real world experience or that of those I know so far in regards to the implementation of the ACA.	Zzzzzz Zzzzzz
14507	But why would you use a decentralized app; centralized systems are more efficient?	After Hong Kong protests, the decentralized app, FireChat strikes again in Russia
14508	Because there's some news that might possibly be potentially negative and as a gamer it's our sacred duty to be cynical bastards and always assume the worst.	Why would you assume that things aren't polished? Maybe they are working on the game as they are doing mocap to save time instead of doing mocap &amp; then do polishing.
14509	I've been debating getting a wrist workout tracker thingy, but then I got the iPhone 5s which does basically the same thing, so the only reason I would want one is because of the sleep tracking features, but they are so damn expensive I can't justify it.	Workout tracking app RunKeeper updated to use the M7 coprocessor!
14510	Google fiber allow private services, not commercial, on the regular contract.	Hijacking top comment to make an important point from a response under the article: There seem to be quite some mixups in your article. Most likely, someone tried to run a Tor relay on Comcast, to actively contribute to the Tor network by forwarding traffic for other Tor users. Even more likely, it was an exit relay, which means the relay does not only pass encrypted traffic, but also allows other users to use its connection to access other Internet resources. Many residential ISPs disallow running *any* kind of service on their line, among them Google Fiber (as an example). Please fix your terminology. This is a quite disappointing article for a magazine that calls itself DeepSomethingSomethingWeb. It is highly unlikely that Comcast stopped people from simply *using* Tor as a client.
14511	PoK?	That kashmir is ours.thats the biggest fiction i have read.
14512	It is High school there hawk chop, not Sober school.	How much marijuana should I tell them I smoke? I'm thinking 7 marijuanas.
14513	Ya Graves is bordering OP as is	It is intenden. Imagine the pushing power if it was reduced on turrets as well.
14514	I swear, if they remake Python and bring it back next season....	Vote Shattered Temple, Vote Brood War
14515	No, it's defending a civilian in their home from an intruder	It's not murder. It's the expeditious administration of lethal justice by an authorized municipal agent.
14516	The edit is the best part though hahaha	Honestly the edit didn't help him.
14517	We all know he lying because Koreans give up at the slightest gold deficit	I love how even when praising korean teams he still manages to give me hope with "The teams themselves always try to comeback" meaning ALL is winning some scrims. ^God ^damn ^it ^Froggen.
14518	That's racist!	Swiss voters on Sunday rejected a plan for a seismic shift from the country's all-private health insurance system to a state-run scheme.
14519	Actually, seppuku is when you take a swo- oh, I see what you did there!	I shall now commit seppuku by punching myself repeatedly.
14520	they bang each other	When a mummy and daddy love each other very much...
14521	If only the liberals hadn't politicized the gay marriage issue, it would have happened naturally given a little time.	Yeah. And if the Tea Party's alternate history of the civil rights movement is any indication, they'll be taking credit for gay marriage as well.
14522	Of grad schools; undergrad isn't *that* big.	You're both right. Penn State has the largest alumni assoc in America. (Also receives the 2nd most applications in nation annually) Michigan has the most living alumni (doesnt matter about the alumni assoc).
14523	The word "troll" really lost it's meaning...	I think turtle, regi, or dyrus gave an interview about being in "serious mode" during LAN play and scrims. As far as flashing into crazy shit... that kind of shows a bit of trolly attitude but I do think that he is serious during LANs. If not that's the first thing loco would fix.
14524	You mean they don't have FBI and CSI agents on every car breaking dusting for fingerprints and matching them to every database in the nation?	If they dont see the guy breaking into the car, do you realize how near impossible it would be to find out who did it?
14525	Yea, the "Coming Soon" spots on the dark barrracks were just a big sham and they were definitely not going to add any more dark troops.	I count this as me winning the argument on whether or not they would "ever" add more dark troops. That answer was yes! This update is SO legit.

14528	More like "entering", if the doors are all unlocked	Do you want him arrested for breaking &amp; entering? Because that's how he gets arrested for breaking &amp; entering.
14529	Except for having a baby, because OBVIOUSLY that's a gift from God and never a conscious decision.	A 72-hour waiting period wouldn't make me reconsider my choice - it would just piss me off. This is a slap in the face, telling women they can't be trusted to make their own decisions.

14532	It was printed on a my schools machine.	First print? On an already calibrated machine?
14533	its not collusion if it goes through a waiver system... perhaps her husband will think shes unfaithful if another player picks him up first?	They might call it collusion anyway if he picks him up. Luckily Gordon won't make an appearance until week 12 so you're probably fine.
14534	Yeah and you should never go to a doctor because they will just make you sick to get more money.	What motivation does the ALS Foundation have to cure ALS?
14535	Yeah, that totally read like a real conversation, and not just something concocted to make karma.	I wish more of my friends would deliberately set me up for punchlines.

14537	Why not save even more and get Taurus SHO?	Lincoln MKS with AWD, and then save the other $80k and put a down payment on a house. 365hp, and 350lbs of torque is more then enough for me in an AWD platform, even if it is a heavier car.

14551	Sports champions 2 on PS3 is probably the best tennis, it's 1:1 with move controllers and holding the move in your hand feels really natural as a racket analogue -- it wouldnt feel right empty handed.	Well, Jeff did say that he would rather be playing Wii Tennis.
14552	if calling her a cunt isn't sexist, assuming she wanted attention to get dick definitely is sexist.	How was my post in any way shape or form sexist? There is a young lady clearly so fucking cock hungry for attention she wore A BARBIE BOX to her prom. Its nothing to do with the fact shes a woman, you can be a cunt regardless of sex.
14553	DMG here and from experience matchups with silvers are just bad, silver player might get 2-3 kills and higher rank player might still lose with 35+ kills... I created an alt to play with lower ranked friends (I just use p250), but also that got to mg2 rank already... Time for another alt that only knifes	I got pretty excited when I saw this thread, unfortunately I'm MG2, would not mix well with silver :(

14562	this explains why the USPS put fedex and UPS out of business.	Imagine your town didn't have a mexican restaurant. You decide to start one to meet some unmet demand. You invest your life savings, but because your turning a reasonable profit you don't feel so bad about it, infact your set to be in the black in just two years! Then after year 1, the govt decides to build its own mexican restaurant. They don't have to worry about making a profit so they just charge the cost of food and labor for the food. You are quickly priced out of the market and lose all of the investment you put in. In year two the service at the govt restaurant becomes kind of shitty because funding was cut. People hate it, but its there only option.NOBODY is going to invest in another mexican restaurant... Not after they see what happened to you, and when the govt could easily just run them back out of business. No more investment means no more good service. Everybody cries and no tacos are had. The end.

14568	oh i am sorry that i writte something wrong in my second language, i am truly sorry for that	I'm not sure that you are qualified to critique an article with that level of grammar.
14569	Because that doesn't happen in real life	Yea, but were they as gross as they were in the movie? 15-16 year old girls talking about how their underwear gets wet when they see that one hot guy?
14570	Surely the high premiums and cost of business is worth all the "cultural enrichment" your business would get from operating in a neighborhood like that!	I wonder why business are hesitant to open in such vibrant neighborhoods. Surely they don't face an increased risk of theft and higher insurance premiums, making the cost of goods higher to its residents as compared with elsewhere. Of course, according to the left, higher prices and so-called "food deserts" aren't the result of economics, it's 'racism' and other prejudice by corporations and small businesses.
14571	Oh boy I can't wait to re-live those 10 archers per side games.	archer nerf has been long awaited and damnit if they don't need one. archers might cry, but the rest of the 3 class mains will rejoice in less bullshit archery scumbags. I'm sure to compensate the archers, they'll remove the class limits though ;) JUST FOR YOU GUYS!

14575	It's not like there has ever been a trans*serial killer.	The most disturbing thing about this is that he's not fantasizing about killing, I don't know, a bully, a politician who passed some law against trans people, a transphobic boss etc. You know, someone that actually hurt him in one way or another. But instead, he said that he wants to murder ANY cishet; doesn't matter who, as long as they love the opposite sex and identify with the gender they were assigned at birth.
14576	Yeah man,in my opinion they should ban all the Islam apologists, commies, congress and AAP supporters and pseudo-secularists.	what an idea sirji! i completely agree.

14601	Anyway he can claim US citizenship in a day and join the US team?	The look on Marty's face in the picture as it relates to the article is just priceless.
14602	Damn those mexicans, all they do is not work and take all our jobs!	and then you bitch that we snipers dont do anything. stop being such a baby and pick one. either you let us instakill you at 12m because we are taking precsion shots trying to help cap and defend flags while spotting and pdling vehicles or you let us be 250m away and start shooting from long range picking off targets and spotting and do our job. This is why we cant have nice things. People either bitch they dont do anything or that they are silly and cod kiddys when they are trying to help them cap flags. plot twist one way or another your gonna bitch about us not doing one thing over the other.
14603	Just like how religious extremists have made me despise Muslims and gangbangers have made me despise blacks and Latinos... Yeah, that'll show them!	It's shit like this that makes me despise the stoner culture...
14604	Not true, according my extensive experience in one semester of Marketing	Just being aware of the brand is good enough for the marketers
14605	Well your local aces were probably tired of all the visibility and supportive attitudes anyway	Allies literally spend ace week drowning out aces. My old university has basically school-sanctioned graffiti rocks, and someone literally painted over ace week stuff with ally week stuff.
14606	No it's not.	He outright called Kanye West slave music. That's racist.
14607	Nah lets cut funding for these nerds and build more bombs.	somehow I can't help feeling the money and time could be better spent elsewhere. I understand that some space technology is eventually useful on earth but why is it so important that we know exactly what happened right after the big bang? couldn't those billions be spent designing better, cheaper water filtration, maybe better solar technology? Improvements in food production? Improvements in 3rd world education and healthcare?

14610	Not too long ago, a kid died because of this.	My school wouldn't let me carry my asthma inhaler, it had to stay at the nurses office because it was a "medication". As a severe asthmatic as a kid, I almost passed out from lack of oxygen a few times walking to the nurse, and was even denied leaving class a few times.

14613	Unless you think the behind-the-scenes guys are smart enough to know that fielding lunatic fringe candidates means that everyone compromises by moving further to the right.	Exactly. It is almost a bad farce at this point. The cognitive dissonance necessary for the traditional conservative GOP to hate on Obama is almost inconceivable.
14614	Some Neocons just never learn.	Max Boot: Without U.S. troops, Afghanistan, like Iraq, could descend into chaos
14615	I think that when you're so far to the right that Thatcher and Reagan seem like hippies, you see this list of environmental vandalism as a *good* thing.	Why was this posted by a right winger? This blog post and the ensuing comments discredit the right entirely in the eyes of any sane person.

14618	Only because that other guy is facing the *wrong direction*.	Eh, depends on which way you look at things. Right to you is left to someone else.
14619	so basically instead of "no" you meant to write "yes".	No, she's a whining egotistical bitch bordering on sociopathy, throwing a bullshit excuse to paint herself a victim in hopes of rallying sympathy from the feminist crowd Fuck her and fuck anyone who buys her bullshit
14620	This is awesome.	Seems like an easy feature to add to a Fitbit or something. Maybe the Apple Watch. You laugh but that would be a massive play for Healthkit.
14621	They're a bunch of buttheads.	I'm pissed that I had to scroll this far, what the hell is wrong with people.
14622	It was necessary on a man who offered no aggressive resistance?	No it doesn't. The policy states very clearly they should not be used except when necessary. I don't know where you people get your facts from.
14623	The correct word would be "solution"	The "problem" (I don't know it is a kind of problem or not.) is much more obvious in DK2.
14624	what makes you think that?	Somehow I don't think these kids had parents that were "over protective"
14625	90% is diverted from landfill, using this biogasification in combination with all the other recycling facilities.	Cool thanks! So 90% is diverted but not all of that 90% is 'gasified'? Or is basically any carbon-based waste 'gasifiable'?
14626	That's because you're an over-zealous soccer mom!	I prefer my stadiums flareless and with minimal violence.
14627	But guyz its not Randy's fault, he's won a Cup he cant possibly be a bad coach.	How the hell does randy not see this?!?!? all pictures are seconds before each tampa goal. theres a bit of a trend.

14629	I mean it's not like he would have stayed with the Heat had they won last year, right?	Listen to this link carefully - Did LeBron say to Wade on Christmas: "Like I said, if we aren't better this year, we're gonna re-unite again and do some bigger and better things, alright?"
14630	Fuck yeah that crying little girl towards the end because her eyes were on fire was hilarious.	It's still funny though
14631	Ha go choke on that battleship	And fuck.

14633	It's very good and recognizable!	Made a new channel icon, hoping for some feedback?
14634	so if i lose my job, and start to spend my savings, i pay a higher tax?	The thing, it doesn't really burden them any more when you look over a lifetime. Someone who saves half their income pays less of their income in a consumption tax then someone who spends every dollar, yes. But if the saver ever starts drawing down on their savings to consume, their tax paid for that year will be a *higher* proportion of their income. And they never draw down on their savings, then they haven't really benefited from them, it did as much good to them as it did for Scrooge.

14637	It's England	Reddit, what, if anything do you know about my home country, Wales?
14638	Because God is merciful	Wait so God put some people in Hell for thousands of years (Judgement day is supposed to last thousands of years) and then at the end of it, simply went, nah, just pull those people back out, I forgive them. Why make them suffer horrendous torture for thousands of years if you were just going to forgive them? :\
14639	you are assuming way too much there is no liability on the potential investor's part, except possibly the value of their cash, so unless you have something to say that isn't anecdotal, then you don't really have to worry about it	They're not saying it is easy. In fact they went out of their way to let us know how difficult it would be. I don't know what the practical way is. I'm just saying a bunch of well-known angel investors knows the regulations forwards and backwards.
14640	Blackmon isn't even close to Aldon..... uneven trade.	I think it would benefit both teams. But I still love Aldon Smith.
14641	Yeah... I'd much rather have Ed Milliband in power.	The British don't deserve good leaders. That's why they have David Cameron.
14642	There was the former UK ambassador to NATO coming out for Yes recently but that's been about it.	I'm increasingly thinking not. I thought a high profile Labour or LibDem proclamation for Yes might have been on the cards, but that seems not to have materialised. The No campaign now appears to be a spent force, resorting to emotional blackmail as a last gasp strategy.

14644	Well then you folks need to invest in robots that can be remotely controller over the internet so that people don't have to physcially go to the library, they can just log in to a robot that is already physically there and do everything they'd normally be able to do.	In time, no, but we are nowhere NEAR that point. The physical library collection still dwarfs the digital collection, and honestly most people do not have a good device for prolonged reading other than a physical book. I like to check out comic books or graphic novels from the library. Something about printed artwork makes it far better to me than when it is displayed on a screen, even though I imagine most of it is produced with a computer anyway. I better stop... feels like I'm starting to babble...

14649	How can they be Christian if they did not grow up listening to Jimmy Swaggert?	My favorite was the people who thought Middle Eastern accents were indicative of Muslims. It shows the ignorance of Zionists who don't even realize the history of Christianity in that region.
14650	Sheeple-vision!	Just look at the nose of each plane....very different

14653	Okay.	No
14654	should have come to my country ;)	It's exactly why I never defended myself in my old relationship. She would hit me however she liked, and all I wanted to do was give her a solid 1-2. But I didn't, not because of some lofty ideal, but because I knew no matter what, all I would hear is "there is no reason to hit a woman" and I would be a pariah and I would be the one who would get in trouble
14655	Don't worry, it's not like he's not known for absurd power trips, or anything.	But "incessant drama" is kinda subjective

14657	A Jew.	What would be the worst thing to be reincarnated as?
14658	Neither can I. Just relaying beliefs I know many Christians (and churches) hold.	That's weird. I don't see why a newborn, who can't even take care of them self without a parents help would be condemned.
14659	because anytime a woman posts a story about anything, they're obviously lying about something	This was EXACTLY my thinking. This is not a goddamn court where you are attempting to suss out percentage of blame to both parties. It's one person's story. Let them tell it. (Not you, the troll you are responding to)

I am actually envious of people who are just watching it for the first time and not knowing what's coming. I almost wish I didn't binge watch the whole series in two weeks but it was too good to stop. Although to me Breaking Bad will never get old. I am now re-watching the series for the 5th time:)

14669	good thing we used Puig to pinch run though	We had no one to go to in the seventh inning from the pen. Kershaw had to go out for the seventh, but when he got into trouble, we had nobody. I've railed on Mattingly for some decisions he's made this season (also, let it be known Puig didn't even get an AB tonight) but Colletti fucked this team with his inability to get anything done at the deadline this season.
14670	I trust Henrik vs Chicago's forwards more than our forwards vs Quick	Who do we want in the final?! Chicago have far worse goaltending but a super hot Kane they are dangerous on all lines. Kings have a Hank-class goalie with a really good 70'ies line with Carter. Rest is OK with a hot Gaborik.. I look at it this way. Chicago will be offensive and the Kings will be defensive. Do we rely on OUR offense to score on Quick or on Hank to shut down the Kane's, Sharps, Hossas and Toews??
14671	The underachiever	If you had a signature sex move, what would it be?
14672	Todd Haley	Who are the greatest offensive minds in the NFL today? It seems like that the defensive" gurus" are more well known in the league, like Rex Ryan. But it's hard for me to think of someone who is considered an offensive genius, who's actually had success. The one person that stands out to is Tom Moore, currently coaching on the Cardinals. As a Colts fan I believe he was instrumental in giving Peyton the confidence early in his career to become a field general. When Peyton was on the sideline, he was almost always discussing things with Moore.

14674	Lil' Smith probably thought it was serious when he posted it.	That's a serious quote?
14675	Helicopter dick always worked for me, that penis propeller let them know nothing serious was happening.	No, no, it has to be more complicated than that! Isn't there secret wink, handshake, I heard if I place my purse on the left side of the table and not the right side, he'll understand my intentions, right?
14676	Yes criticism of Israel is automatically due to antisemitism.	doesn't matter, news can be used to bash Jews, reddit rolls with it. Try not to stand in the way of the Jew hating karma train.
14677	I never said it was on accident.	Come on. I highly doubt that Sony Entertainment in 2013 had forgotten that CDs and DVDs use different wavelengths. If that was the issue, then they left it out on purpose.
14678	It's legit and brand new just got mine	Crazy. I didn't know that was even an option.
14679	Actually it says it multiplies into 7, which is technically different from two unique Binacles merging.	Apparently Barbaracle is formed from two Binacle as mentioned in their Dex Entry

14683	What then, if 3D printers become self aware?	You can print the pieces to build a 3D printer, yes.
14684	And MSAA is just multisampling, so relatively less information gets lost because there was 4x as much screen data in the other AA modes.	Just because you can do more passes of AA doesn't make it look better. Every pass, you do lose some information. It really depends on the game. Sometimes it looks better, sometimes worse.
14685	Yeah, at y=12 no where near a village they would totally assume it was a villager	Nooooo no no no NO. If they sounded like villagers, then the mindcrackers would just think that it was a villager.
14686	oh, well everyone's buying them, i'll take a dozen.	I feel you! When I was younger I used to go to best buy and the employees would tell me I'm wrong and they're right even when I know I'm right. I've built PCs and coded for small stuff and I definitely knew more than them. For example the employee told me all-in-one PCs were the best because "everybody is buying them"
14687	Sue the Americans, they're they ones that saved him from his wounds.	What about the torture at Guantamo? Was that his family's fault too?
14688	Glad I'm not the only one who remembers that...	This reminds me a little of when Pres. Carter said in Playboy that he "lusted after women in his heart."
14689	Woaw sounds like you picked a real winner	My boyfriend owns a pizza by the slice place and has a policy of, "if you flash the line and cashier, you get a free slice if you're attractive (judged by the cashier)". Am I wrong to think that is fucked up? It is a trashy place and most of the customers are drunk. Peak hours are midnight to 3am on Saturday. It isn't illegal (I checked, &amp;75 8 5:8,' 5:#5 8* )7='3(

14694	I am sure that Limbaugh listeners come out pretty high as well	no actually. every week somebody posts a TIL where they show some study comparing fox, msnbc, cnn, and comedy central knowledge base on the current issues. the daily show viewers come out ahead.
14695	It's only hoarding if the rich people do it	I thought saving was called hoarding? And that it's bad? If we want to make the economy stronger for all of us, we're supposed to immediately spend our paychecks.
14696	You're more than welcome!	How kind of you to inform me.
14697	Jake Busey?	It was honestly terrifying. It's like seeing a confused little kid at the mall except he's 6"1 and talks shit all the time.
14698	Yea I remember when the Federal Government passed that law saying it was illegal to be overweight.	Fat entitlement
14699	Why don't you want to write your apps in a fast language, and then compile them to a slow one?	Yeah, no thanks.
14700	How inappropriate!	In other news chicken nuggets have been removed from the school's lunch menu as the staff have noticed both the similarity of the word 'nugget' to a racial epithet and that, when spelled backward, it reads similarly to "the gun", which may cause students to rampage and murder. They have been replaced with chicken balls, whose name the administration has not yet identified any problems with.
14701	So know I have a legit excuse for not getting a career?	Born in December and striving for a career in sports? Bad luck for you.
14702	Wait... but HOW would people would be rewarded for their hard work if everyone is just a simple worker?	There would still exist a managerial stratum in a socialist society, if only because for organisational purposes an overseer is often needed. However, management would be democratically elected by the workers and elected positions would always be subject to reelection, so if a worker was made manager, she would be recallable at any time if the workers she managed felt she was an inadequate choice. Ultimately, they're would be no class distinction between those in managerial positions and those in regular working positions as Marx envisioned a classless society where everybody is a worker.

14707	Because being poor is worse than never having existed... Yup, this checks out as making sense.	And now Indians (like your grandparents) created the largest amount of people living in poverty that the world has ever seen. Good for them.
14708	To be fair, they might actually be the only people who actually have bootstraps to pull on!	Then change it for future employees but you can't cut pensions to retirees cause you feel like you made a bad deal in the past. What are they supposed to do just go back to work at 60+ years of age?
14709	Eh, I don't think she can pull it off.	I could see her being Ramona Flowers.
14710	You're right, good people who see evil in action should do nothing.	See there, man pulls a gun to save lives and things worked out. It might not have, but fear and intent can help keep you focused and alert and that's a good thing to be in a shootout. Conversely, when a wanna-be piggy gets a raging hard on at the chance to finally use his gun for real real, in his excitement he doesn't see the second shooter and doesn't live long enough to be embarrassed about dying in Walmart.
14711	nothing sounds better than hearing "turn down for what" out of some earbuds	I have a vinyl player, only it's digital and is also my phone and computer. Vinyl is archaic, and not in a cool way like Latin or being principled.

14713	As a CB	How will Revis be used? If I remember correctly, when Ty Law played he had some issues with BB on how he was used. He wanted to play man more or something along those lines? Just curious how you think Revis will be used, man, press or zone? I'm sure a combination of all of the above?

14727	Yeah but that was ages ago, it doesn't count any more!	Colonial Europe messed the entire world up. The Americas, Africa, Australia, even Asia (the biggest example of which was the French occupation of India). Europe just decided the world was theirs for the taking and the three biggest offenders were Spain England and France (with a few cameos from the Dutch and the Portuguese).

14730	yeah, forcing women to initiate, that always works out so well.	Don't say it creepily and don't linger if she looks like she isn't into it, but this is the best one liner I have ever received: "Hey I know this is really random and I'm sorry for interrupting, but I just wanted to let you know that you have an absolutely beautiful smile. My name is _________ and I'll be right over there if you want to talk, because I'd really like to get to know you better." It lets her have a minute to reflect if she wants to go over and it also puts the ball in her court so you don't have to keep putting yourself out there. Its also a really really sweet compliment that doesn't come on too strong or seem sexual/predatory. Also I know it's not one sentence but sometimes you've gotta bend the rules.
14731	Yes, proving that so-called 'pro-Palestinian activists' actually have ulterior motives and simply use the Palestinians as a means to demonize the Jews - sure is weird!	Weirdo.
14732	surely OP will return to converse and argue their point....	Atheism/theism logic Hello all, I was hoping you'd be able to help me through a sort of mental gridlock I've found myself in recently. Please try to hang with me on this, it might get a bit jumbled. I'm hoping I can concisely convey my thoughts. I'll lead this with a bit of background of myself. I was raised Catholic and realized at a pretty early age that most of what I was being told just doesn't make sense; it wasn't logical to me. I won't get into the details there but mostly I couldn't understand god's motivation or reasoning that stemmed from his rules. Fast forward to the past few months - I've been turning something over in my head and it's really starting to bother me. The line of thought typically goes something like this: * I do not believe in god because his actions do not seem logical. * As a betting man I find it silly to not believe in god - there is no benefit for me if I'm right, but if I'm wrong I'm fucked. I'm better off picking a god and hoping I'm right; even if I pick the wrong god, I'm giving myself a better chance at not failing. I believe this is commonly known as Pascal's Wager. * So I choose to believe in God. *We'll say at this point in the argument that the Christian god is the "right" god and he does exist.* * But wait - surely this is not genuine faith. I am basing my "belief" on playing the odds, and not what I truly feel. As I've already been through the whole Catholic thing I find it very difficult to think that I'll be able to truly believe in the future. * There's no way a god would let me into heaven if this was the basis of my belief. *I've heard a few people find themselves in this predicament - but this is where it gets complicated for me*. * However, I've already established that I can't understand the logic or reasoning behind much of what god does or feels (point #1). Therefore point #5 isn't reason enough for me to not at least try to believe in god. And this is where I usually give up and think about something less taxing. A theist might jump in here and tell me I need to believe or devote myself but as I mentioned above I've been indoctrinated and still somehow ended up here in the land of nonbelievers, which would lead me to think that I'll never truly be able to believe. Why a god would curse me with such a brain is beyond me, but that brings me immediately back to point #1. Ugh. I'm exhausted just writing this. If you've read this far, thanks. Maybe someone out there has some insight.

14737	Thanks for not downvoting and answering my question honestly.	"The TTK isn't low, the netcode is good" Can somebody explain this to me? I compared weapon damage to other guns of previous CODs and they are significantly higher than before yet I almost always get downvoted for pointing this out. Playing COD4 offline with a second controller, the netcode is about the same as GHosts and I kill slower than Ghosts. Provided ROF is much higher than COD4, the damage is higher also. Please instead of just saying netcode is better, explain. I am getting tired of pointing it out, and getting downvoted to have someone say "No. Netcode is better" and thats it.
14738	I was thinking more along the lines of a romcom.	Hmm, I think we have the beginning to a porn here
14739	no you just steal the whole home and the land it was sitting on....	it's funny because from the Israeli point of view you can destroy a Palestinian home but you cannot steal from it.
14740	No, but he stayed at a Holiday Inn!	Well did your brother recently cancel Comcast?
14741	Well to be fair, he saw your mom last night.	You haven't seen many 50 year olds then.
14742	Someone suggested that this was actually a sign of character growth for Inaho; he wants to protect the princess, who may not be dead, and instead of thinking like the logicball he is, his feelings for the princess go through and he does something illogical; pulling a gun on Slaine.	But why did Inaho draw his gun? He's too smart to think he could get a shot off before Slaine shoots him. I think he did it because, despite his outer appearance, he was overcome with grief at the end and wanted revenge. It adds a delicious ironic twist for the seemingly stoic and unemotional character to be done in by a momentary lapse in judgement caused by his emotions.
14743	I dunno, remember Diablo III on PC?	If neither Sony or Bungie have server issues come launch, I will be honest to god ASTONISHED. I've been through a ton of launches of online games, and for one to not shit the bed is exceedingly rare.
14744	According to people who have followed him all the way back to high school, he's always been an asshole.	I'm gonna play devil's advocate. We like to toss around this phrase in a sarcastic way to show how little the NFL cares for player's safety, but a $25,000 fine and now he's under the microscope. That's not something to sneeze at. I haven't heard much about Burfict's play and whether it's normally dirty, but if this is his first time I'm ok with the fine and warning. A larger fine would have made me happier, somewhere in the $75k-$100k range. He won't be able to do it again without a serious penalty like a suspension.

Manny seems to be taking this pretty well, I'm not sure I would be able to play the game after something like that happened to me, but that's probably why I don't play it. They also have two podcasts coming out tomorrow morning about this, one with Alex Gianturco and another with Manny. Pretty excited about those as well.

14757	One tweet doesn't define the Dolphins, but one tweet like that, regarding the first openly gay NFL player, on the day of the draft, after everything that happened this year, doesn't speak to an organization that has gotten control of its personnel yet.	Because one single tweet defines our entire organization. The Eagles must be going to shit because of the Riley Cooper thing too right?
14758	I added you on FB dood	If I hadn't of started Legit Boardshop, I would have deleted my FB 2 years ago... on the plus side, I've gone to at least 6 longboarding events I would have never known about if it wasn't for FB.

14773	Except for the government telling the doctor how much he can charge or telling the patient how much he has to save.	For non-catastrophic care, there is no politician, insurance worker, or employer standing between the patient and the doctor. That is nothing like single payer.
14774	Oh yeah, this little QoL change would certanly tip Shen over the edge into Pick/Ban territory.	No shen is supposed to help allies with his shield. Giving him even perfect positioning is too much cause the enemy would lack counterplay.

14776	No, it's not safe, I've never done it before.	Safe to ship multiple IDs via U.S. mail? my order is coming soon, but my friends and I are already back at school so I'm having someone ship us all the IDs separately. The person has to send 6 IDs to me since two other people from my school were in the order, so I was wondering if its safe to ship 6 ids in a regular envelope, or will usps do something if they suspect somethings wrong? All the shipping I'm talking about is domestically. (sorry if this is a dumb question)
14777	I think most conspiracy theories are ridiculous to say the least ,but for someone to dismiss the idea of the government doing something nefarious is equally ridiculous to me.	even if that had actually gone through and wasn't immediately rejected (also, those acts of terrorism were never meant to harm americans, only scare them, which admittedly isn't good, but those are two entirely different things), what possible reason could they have for spreading a deadly disease and inciting panic?

14781	Yeah, and that's why California has cut its unemployment rate and uninsured rate for health insurance in half in just 4 years, while also paying down our wall of debt...because the Dems running this state are ineffective!	Unfortunately, the other party is either totally corrupted or completely ineffective.
14782	To be fair, you only gotta be right once.	They never will. It's like predicting the end of the world, it has been going on since the start of the world and every single time people have been wrong, but they just forget and start over again...

Her name was Ellen Harmon Gould before she was married and the SDA church considers her a contemporary prophet. The book is concerned with highlighting the biblical controversy or battle between Christ and Satan. It is a very old edition from the looks of it and probably still contains a since removed chapter from the book that was deemed to horrific. Your grandfather might have been at a time SDA.

14810	Yeah, but I never see those people and they live in some third world shithole anyway so they don't matter.	Not only that but there is more slaves in the world at this very moment than there was at any point in history...give or take some obviously. Haiti is a huge slave zone.
14811	Don't hate on my finishing ability!	If your 5'7 you're not going to get fouled. They will let you go and swat you from behind. They wouldn't have to foul you.
14812	Ah, so I see she understands why you don't talk to her anymore!	I fluctuate between VLC/NC; MRW my Nfam passively aggressively remark on my noticeable distance
14813	Maybe it's a direct quote, and the snail doesn't like to swear.	It's okay, you can say "fuck" here. Go ahead, give it a try!
14814	quit, not quite.	Didnt quite what? DIDNT QUITE WHAT??!?!
14815	Because no white people get harassed or shot at by cops?	As a non-black minority, the fact that whitefolk aren't afraid of cops is a bizarre concept I could never understand.

14822	This mod gets dumber by the day	Tents disabled? Hello everybody, My friends and I have been playing the mod for about a week and last night we noticed we weren't able to build tents anymore. We built a few military crates but they were not accessible. Does anybody know why the tents are disabled or if they coming back? Thanks!

14828	Actually it was more about poking at the reddit hive that supports violence and those people not understanding that those type of posts and comments could cause a strong follower to act out on.	But making fun of reddit is so much easier if I treat it as one singular hivemind instead of millions of people with differing opinions about everything under the sun!!
14829	The sight ward and vision ward last for differing amounts of time, there has to be a visual indicator to distinguish between the two.	Because the trinket ward and a standard sight ward last for differing amounts of time, there has to be a visual indicator to distinguish between the two. It is not as simple as just mapping a ward skin to a trinket ward; they have to have an additional distinguishing feature. Up until now, they had not conceived of one. Sometimes ideas take a long time to conceive and reduce to practice. If you were in the business of creating things, I suspect you would understand.
14830	It actually can be both, you see he's gutting the army becuase they'll remain loyal to the american people, he's rerouting money he supposedly gutted from the army to mercanaries who'll be loyal to him and the NWO by contract.	Alex jones also complains that Obama is "gutting" the military. So which is it a giant buildup or a gutting. Not sure it can be both.
14831	Arachne, Zhong Kui, and Ne Zha don't need buffs too.	He doesn't need a buff.

14833	Oh, you chair the committee that decides who is or isn't a socialist?	You are a child. When you grow up and learn how the real world works, and how people are fucking oppressed beyond your white male concept of it, you can call yourself an adult. You don't belong anywhere near any worker's movements.
14834	And that sesto elemento, don't even get me started	The Veneno is the plainest car ever, maaaaan
14835	Lighten up, he typed it up on his phone.	That article would have been better if it wasn't filled with spelling and grammatical errors. "faced-based schools" "is damaging to out children" "then we can just ban" (he meant 'can't') Does no one proof read their work anymore?
14836	Plenty of route one football if those two play together!	Nek minnit - Brosque as marquee. On a more serious note though - SFC should sign Cahill and Drogba. I'd love to see that.
14837	Everything	No! Don't get used to it! If it's normal, then what have we to fight for?

14841	This will be the very definition of swift justice.	its 'under investigation' guys, dont worry.
14842	This joke never ceases to be funny	That'll buff right out.
14843	That is how I pronounce it, so yes it is right!	The narrator is pronouncing the G in Gnome. Is that correct?
14844	Totally an angel.	Pulsating Beam Hits the Sun/The Images are being Removed.
14845	someone forgot the	This just didn't happen overnight. After a huge influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe with powerful connections, access to international bankers and a fetish for everything communist, they set out to overthrow America and rebuild it in their image. Today these operatives are in every branch of government, the State Department, entrenched in law schools and law firms controlling every media outlet and even the courts. I'm sorry to say, we've done too little too late and we just have to sleep in the bed they created for us. Revolutions are spearheaded by the youth and ours are placated with digital media and the rest are strung out on doctor prescribed narcotics.
14846	Yeah Baylor played at 100% that game too.	We were riddled with injuries. They weren't beating a Texas team that was 100%.
14847	Because that's what the post was about, Right?	Why is everyone wanting to know about the fountain!!
14848	And they get the added bonus of having assets in place when the SHTF.	Here's the thing. They don't really give it the police department. They lend it to the police department. That department then takes over the responsibility of maintaining that vehicle until the point that something happens that causes the military to need it again. So instead of the army spending millions maintaining a fleet of trucks it's not using atm in case of future need, it's put to use by police departments until there is a need for it. My city has one that is basically used for publicity. They bring it out to fairs and events. During holidays they park it near busy commuter routes with the hope that it will remind people to drive safer.
14849	Kid deserved it- stupid Yankees fan.	Xander Bogaerts tossed a ball to a kid. An adult swiped it. Boooo!
14850	Ya man you should totally do it!	Love these. Should I unds the mints?
14851	Well this isn't completely subjective.	Dota 2 is completely free but significantly harder. It follows the TF2 formula of free to play. Only thing you buy is character skins. Runs on Source and made by Valve, so the graphics are much better then LoL. All the heroes are balanced really well due to the sadistic genius that is icefrog, and the pro games are much more interesting and fun to watch as a result. I prefer Dota 2. League is not as free (you have to buy or grind for 3 years to play all the champions). It is much easier but very poorly balanced. A pool of about 15-20 champions ever see competitive play. Graphics are celshaded and colorful but significantly dated. I see zero reason to play LoL over Dota, but I still do regularly because my friends are awful at Dota and think the can go pro at League, which won't happen because they suck at league too. Overall I'd recommend Dota 2. League is not worth the grind/price of entry. Dota is free and better. Only negative is how hard it is. Anyone who says otherwise is in denial. Come at me fanboys.
14852	2nd ammendment gungrabber!	What the hell is so awful about making sure you aren't at the minimum, fucking bonkers before you can buy a gun?

14855	Marilyn Monroe was a shining example of a healthy and well adapted psyche.	Oh jesus fucking christ.... you hit the nail on the head. Is it a coincidence that all the loud mouth feminists on my facebook absolutely love Marilyn Monroe and her shitty pseudo-philosophical quotes? One of my closer female friends who has been on a hyper-bitchy feminist posting spree lately has a fucking *tattoo* of Marilyn Monroe's face on her shoulder.
14856	You and your old ways.. Now we have DVDs for all that!	1) I don't believe in memorization, I believe in understanding 2) I don't believe these type of issues can be resolved over the internet. 3) I don't believe they should be resolved on the internet. Our craft has implemented a system of coaching, mentorship and education within most of our lodges. It builds camaraderie, trust and actually helps the candidate because it is coming from within the lodge from masons who the man knows as such and allows the lodge to determine how best to approach that individual. If there is something wrong with aforementioned system, he needs to turn to someone within his GL, and once again this is outside the internet. I just can't stand candidates running to reddit seeking help when they can equally go to someone within their organization who is just as capable. You are undermining the coach and the lodge in their duties. Maybe it's just me. I'm not so conservative but I was raised to be cautious and be conscious about my surroundings most especially to be sure the person who is giving me information is not only a mason good and true, but he actually knows what he is saying.
14857	Yes, I upgraded through the windows app store.	So if I'm understanding you correctly, you had a working Win8 install, and you upgraded to 8.1 and this was the result? How did you do the upgrade? Store?
14858	You mean the players laughingly going oooOOOoooOO doesn't get you as pumped up as the old rival mascots drowning videos?	I get what they were trying to do(a snarling skull) but to my eye it's not done real well. I'm personally not a fan, and my friends who studied design here (most notably, Scott Avett) all hate it. Hopefully it'll grow on us, because it's what we've got for the foreseeable future. But this is Jeff Comphor's second strike in a lot of people's eyes, first being the botched video they run pre run in. He's also angered a lot of the big money donors through some of his actions which they're perceiving as slights. Personally, I'm a fan of most of his moves he's making, but if he continues the way he's going, he won't be the head pirate for very long.
14859	Yeah, the firearms business and related industry are sooo small.	I think VISA would be more afraid of the NRA (and gun owners in general) severing their relationship with them. I'm sure MasterCard and AMEX would gladly accept a few million transferred balances. Maybe even Discover.
14860	Wow, spoken like a man mature enough to raise a family...	I expect to die one day too, but that doesn't mean I am going to start planning my funeral now. :)
14861	I had no intent of purchasing any of the music, movies, games, books, and software I 'own' so it's okay that I pirated it.	You do realize that Thief is a remake , right? Also , what if you pirate a game you never had any intention of purchasing in the first place?
14862	What victims?	Pretty sure they're just trying to protect the victims.
14863	You're right, The Beatles and Michael Jackson were literally all the radio played when they were around, just The Beatles and Michael Jackson on a 24 hour loop, there's wasn't a bunch of other shit playing that no one remembers because it was bad.	false. totally false. the beatles and michael jackson were the top "pop" acts of their time. pop music is as good as those within the genre. are you going to suggest the beatles and MJ were shit? if more people were exposed to better music, the "good" music would pay the best. sadly, 90% of people are never exposed to anything past what's on the billboard top 40, so they just consume the garbage thrown their ways.
14864	Based on your post history, you sound like a TOTALLY happy go-lucky kinda guy!	She truly isn't funny. All of her "jokes" fall flat.
14865	Nah, we should ridicule women for their incompetence instead.	At least she tried. A lot of people are so convinced that they can't improve their homes that they will pay lots of money to have a simple task done for them. This is an easy fix.
14866	I am totally and completely shocked.	Florissant state rep accused of misusing over $100,000 of campaign funds.
14867	But those cost money, and bloggers is free.	Not just that-- the first sentence of the story (still) says the drug dealers got thrown out, not their convictions. I miss the days when "journalist" meant one could string a coherent sentence together. The Before Times. The Long, Long Ago.
14868	Pump and dump	To loosely quote house of cards: JFK never lasted longer than 3 minutes. Powerful men don't have time for sex.
14869	Yep, the running joke among the instructors about this kid is that he will either grow up to be very kind, or very strong.	Reminds me of PT punishments in the Army. Usually with the statement or message of: "you will be smarter or we will continue to make you stronger"

14871	By our white guilt combined, it's a flawless plan	Perfect. We have enough white guilt between us, so we should be safe. :3
14872	Hank Hill taught me this.	As a firefighter who was working that night just a couple towns away from Long Grove, I thought we'd be called on mutual aid to assist. If ever you smell natural gas in or around your home, do not hesitate to call 911. That sulfur smell is added, natural gas is odorless, and is, obviously, not something to fuck around with.
14873	Haven't they stated there is a plan if everything goes tits up?	My problem with Steam is that if, at any point, it suddenly explodes.. we're all out a shit-ton of games, the end. Period. They have you 100% by the nuts. And you can't do shit about it. Further, they can ban/restrict/fuck with your access as they like. I don't especially mind Steam as far as DRM, it could be worse, but I still don't like it at all.
14874	Brilliant idea: Totally gonna make a Pegasus Tribal standard deck with Anthems to power them up, and plenty of exile and oppressive rays.	40% of all Pegasus creatures in the entire game are in Standard right now.
14875	You do realize that at the time of the moon landings, the technology required to fake the moon landings didn't even *exist*, right?	This is why I don't buy that this actually happened. It's like how the moon landing was faked, this was just another made up event to prove military superiority during the Cold War
14876	It also explains why the BoS are at odds with the enclave for more than just clean water.	Yup. This is actually not a surprise. The BoS were fully aware that the Enclave were more advanced than they were. It was mentioned multiple times in the story's dialog. The dialog was especially emphasized right before the Battle of Project Purity. The Enclave's technological advantage was a main point of the BoS's weakness against them. Even the Enclave armor in-game had better armor stats than the T-51b armor set.
14877	True dat	He very sensibly gets wrecked by Thor.
14878	fuck it, numbers are just hard	I agree, I can't completely understand really large numbers. The best description I have heard goes something like this: A hundred minutes ago I was cruising Reddit, just like I am now. A thousand minutes ago I was probably in bed. A million minutes ago was last week. A billion minutes ago Nixon was president. A trillion minutes ago dinosaurs were still walking the earth.
14879	A shame, since it's a pretty good premise, and it's not like there isn't tons of good material even in-context.	Don't worry about it, that subreddit takes many comments out of context.
14880	That we know of	This is a funny circlejerk since Google+ is a social network that is actually HONEST and HASN'T commited crimes against consent, humanity and ethical science. Meanwhile, facebook has. Just because everyone is too fucking stupid to switch to a GOOD social network, doesn't mean that facebook is any good at all.

14884	Sex	Hi, NT partner here. What makes you hang on through the rough first weeks/months? Hi, I've been dating my SO who has Aspergers for, well, not very long. It's been a month since we've been together, so I decided to finally stop lurking and to post. We were penpals for time, and finally decided to meet up when I moved to Europe to study. I'm an introvert by nature who has extroverted herself, and haven't dated much. I'm his first girlfriend. Once we met, things escalated quickly, and before we knew it we were dating. And we're long distance at the moment (but same continent). I'll move closer to where he is in March, for my studies. He was very open with having AS, but didn't tell me much about it. It seems to be a pretty mild case, and from an outsider's pov, it'd just seem like he was a really shy guy. About two weeks into LDR, I started feeling the classical "I feel deserted/lonely/He doesn't love me" symptoms, and that's when I started reading about AS (thank you Kindle!). So far I've read the introductory by Tony Attwood and now I'm into my second book on Aspergers and Relationships. Right now I'm hopping between the "I know he loves me and is the sweetest, gentlest person I've ever met" and the "But I can't feel it and I don't know if this will change and maybe I'm wasting my time" phase. I should also mention that I'm a pretty sensitive person, so my personality might be amplifying the emotional issues. We had a couple of talks about this over Skype, but obviously the communication problem isn't going to disappear in s snap. I feel like we're circling back to the same place: I feel I'm always experiencing the same issues, he feels I always come to the same depressing conclusions. I haven't told most of my friends he has Aspergers, since it's only been a month. I'd actually love to talk to a therapist and get a good talk down, but that's overdoing things, I think. I'm just amazed at how so many couples survive the first few months! How do y'all do it? How do you AS/NT couples manage through the first months? How did you deal with the communication issues? What made you hold on? Any tips? TL:DR; We (24F/21M) want to make our relationship work but it seems like a toughie. I (24F) am lost. Hjalp!

14890	never thought i'd see the day when someone actually complains about matchmaking in the motd	So regarding the MOTD... Does it just randomly pair up the stupidest people then throw 1 maybe 2 people who know what they are doing then versus them against premades? Because that is what my two experiences with this MOTD are... ymir who built damage instead of tank, a hun batz who built tank... We lost before 7 minutes. I know match making is bad but in MOTD... I don't think it exists beyond "lol let's put premades against randoms".... oh wait all matchmaking does this because there is none.

14898	If I didn't have to panhandle to get enough to live on, I wouldn't.	Reddit, If You Had To Panhandle To Make Ends Meet, What Would Your Cardboard Sign Read? I recently saw a women holding this sign outside my local liquor store: " Never Been Homeless, Not A Vet...But It's Come Down To This Folks, Please Help." Also, a different visit to the store, I saw a younger fellow holding a sign in almost the exact same spot: "Vet with young family in need of your help". Both appeared well groomed and I contributed a dollar because I wanted to help. However, upon contact with the "Vet", he did not appear to have any tattoos I normally associate with people in military. So, I felt his sign is what drew me in, but still have no way of knowing if I fell for it. What would your clever sign read? (Even if it wasn't true).

14914	Almost draws parallels to current real life political climates.	First, I have to say I haven't finished the game yet (I'm on the Cid part). The other day I was discussing with friends about the Garlean Empire and how they are the good guys. While they are portrayed as the bad boys, wearing black, being evil and so, the Garlean Empire is a well established and centered nation focusing in a fast cultural expansion by the dominion of the pagan nations. They have advanced by the industry and the science, leaving all these pagan gods that other nations believe. When you look Eorzea trough they eyes, you can see a heretic and miscarried land. Ul'Dah has been corrupted by their own greed, Gridania is just a bunch of hippies who doesn't want to face its problems with the tribes and Limsa is negotiating with pirates and bandits. At the same time, the beast tribes are out of control, and it seems that Eorzea isn't capable to fix the Primal problem by its roots, and they are allowing to the beast tribes to continue sumoning Primals for time to time. So... Garlean has the tools and the technology to salve Eorzea for its own destruction. The science and technology are clearly indication of progression, and Eorzea is just fighting to evade that progression. What do you thing about this?

I know a lot of people who like to brag about working 80 hours but they're home at 6PM every day and have weekends off so, mathematically, I'm not sure how that works. I would say it's very uncommon outside of a few jobs like medical residents or investment bankers.

He created an entire continent (America) too isolated, because *apparently* it was the destiny of 90% of those people to die to horrible diseases. That didn't have to happen. No, humans are not at fault. There is absolutely no conceivable situation in which we have a 1950's understanding of disease before the 1400's invention of long distance sailing. Fuck you god, I won't forgive you for that one.

14930	so original, 100/10	About the hate some people are showing towards Stonebank So, today, the song that a great part of the community was hyping for was released. And many people didn't liked when they saw that the producer was Stonebank. I think that this was just rude and stupid. I know that most of you were expecting a comeback from an old producer, but it's not cool to hate on Stonebank because this. He worked hard on this song, probably had to wait a while so the rooster could have some variation, made the track FOR FREE, and this is the feedback he recieve. I don't expect you all to enjoy the song, since some people don't like his style and that's reasonable. But some people just did some bad things, like disliking the song just because Stonebank, and even say that it was the worse MCat anniversary ever just because it wasn't a comeback. This is not only offensive to the producer but also offensive for the label. I know you hyped for another producer, but there's nothing we can do about it. Thank you for your time.
14931	It was me, not you, wasn't it?	So this happened back when I was tending bar. This particular Saturday night I am vibing with this really cute girl as is want to happen at a bar. As the night winds down, she invites me over to an after hours party at her place. I blow through my cashout and closing work and head over. Things happen and we roll around the sheets. In the afterglow I invite her to my place the next day to hang out wakeboarding and cooking out. A summertime Sunday tradition with me and my roommate. We exchange digits, I give her directions and I head home. The next day, right on time she rolls up to the house. She walks in looks around and asks if I know Lynn V. I say sure she was my previous roommates best friend. She then tells me that she had been to my house before, a year earlier when she met Lynn at a bar one night. I go to find out that she ended up having sex in my bed with Lynn (i was out of town) and that she really preferred women but were bored with them at the moment. It knocked me off my game while I processed the information but then the light bulb went off. After that we had a great day on the boat hanging out and wakeboarding. We ended up "seeing" each other for a month or so. Fun Times. Why we broke it off is a funny Seinfeld-esque story. I'll save that for another day.
14932	Only to faggots, so it's OK!	And what about the passenger saying "faggot"? Isn't that offensive as well?
14933	btw the correct term is "scapegoat" not escape goat :)	People said that helios was Blaze's escape goat, that Koreans said that he sucks, I thought people wouldn't care about him anymore

14939	You had to bring facts into the discussion!	Which liberal said someone doesn't have the right to speak? I think most people despise the Koch billionaires for the disproportionate political influence their wealth has effectively bought (through campaign funds, their tens of lobbying groups). Since data mining is a part of advancing their political goals, it makes sense for critics of the Koch family to dislike them expanding their initiatives. But again, I don't recall anyone saying the Koch brothers should be silenced.

14946	Get out of here with your logic and numbers!	I know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm a computer engineer and write 3D graphics for living. Even created 2 game engines so I learned how stuff works. 30% menas shit if you look at 30% of what. Not to mention that this means 16.7ms at MOST to register the action, so its probably less depending on when the action was taken. So for every action it takes AT MOST 6.7ms more to register it. Seeing as how average human reaction time is 330ms and most pro gamers have really good reflexes so lets say they need 200ms average to respond. When you add the ping and server time (and even without that) 6.7ms means nothing. YOU are the one who is misinformed and fell for some bullshit. Go educate yourself, but first go check how much 6.7ms is.

It's amazing how much of the world is run on minimum wage jobs, for very close to it (under 12 dollars), and yet there is such a stigma against raising the minimum wage. The entire shipping industry relies on minimum wage jobs, for instance. From shipping merchandise (UPS, FedEx and such) to shipping people (such in your case). Minimum wage, extremely demanding jobs, and no benefits (because why would people who literally break their backs and get injured be provided health insurance?).

They should all be dumped into the ocean with weights around their legs, so that we don't have to be ashamed about breathing the same air as them. This is treason, and it should be punished with life in prison. And what makes it even sadder and more frightening is that many of these people have no Islamic background. A great deal of them are converts of Western descent, who have betrayed the very values and ideals that gave them such a privileged lifestyle in Britain. Or we could just send them to Sweden. I'm sure they'll be accepted with open arms.

The red kinda gets absorbed by the ground on summenors rift. Is there any way of changing the colour for that specific spell? Please help :&lt;
15042	Yes, Paladin needs a nerf	Blizzard should hire that guy! Also: I totally agree that the game is most fun if it is about playing minions and effective trading. What kills this fun a lot for me, and I guess also for many others out there are these kind of decks that never really care about board presents, since they can control everything with swipes, silences, removals, etc. from their hand. These are not only the most boring and frustrating decks to play against, but are also the strongest decks in the game, which is why so many people are playing them. One step in the right direction in my opinion would be to considerably weaken any kind of swipes. To mention an example: Equality + Consecration is awfully boring to play against. One of the better designed swipe spells in my opinion is Brawl, since it always leaves the option that the enemy will still have that one phatty on the board afterwards. Another option would be, to make strong swipe spells legendary, so that they could only be in the deck once, meaning that there is a much smaller chance that you have the spell (/combo) early enough in the game.

Of course, all 7 of those guys were gone in the first 4 rounds.
15049	Well, since he's a man that would mean he's *mocking* those TRULY OPPRESSED poor black womyns.	So if it's a man of color, does it make him a "mock"? Trick question, no. It makes him a patriarchal shitlord. Thanks for playing!

15064	Yeah, you're right, he definitely didn't seize it with 7 catches for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns in the Super Bowl	You're right. He had the golden opportunity, but couldn't seize it. And his contract is not favorable to the team, especially considering his drop-off in production from the Larry Fitz we expect. That said, the man is a class act and seems like a genuinely nice guy. This coupled with the facts that he is still a solid receiver and was at one point an elite receiver, makes people inclined to answer with his name in topics like these. I for one agree with them. While I wouldn't want the Giants to lose, if Larry and the Cards beat the Giants on the way to the Superbowl, I could make peace with it.

15075	Yes, I'm totally surprised that the stereotype of modern atheists was played by a Christian, too.	I didn't think it was utterly terrible but it was a bit trite in places. The whole deathbed conversion thing was really badly done though. I will say this though, Sorbo does make a really good angry atheist/antitheist guy. I was amazed when I found out he's actually a Christian.
15076	Yeah, it's not like someone could pretend to be him on the Internet.	No. That isn't true.
15077	He should feel such shame, for not being addicted to reddit and trying to get as much karma as possible.	I love how people don't even realize that you replied to two of my comments in the same thread like you're stalking me. But I get all the downvotes. Good for you though. Three years in reddit, and three thousand karma. What is it you say you do here? :)
15078	I dunno, bettman is really doing wonders.	There is very little competition for that title haha. It's like he's the only one who cares if people hate him or not
15079	That's good, with his stupidity he needs to be on a mature, level-headed team with responsible players around him to avoid getting in trouble.	Ravens sign suspended former Giants Safety Will Hill
15080	They are planning to nerf her.	Why is Ahri before the last part so useless in the new cinematic? A) No Mana B) She unlocked lvl 6 at the end C) She fed the enemy team D) Just noob E) She's baiting (???)
15081	Don't go downtown much, where will be a good place to park?	Map for the June 21 NASA on the Square exhibits and activities
15082	Makes us fear for what we would bring to the relationship.	I'm independent. I fix my own car. I can do a roof flooring plumbing and electrical. I know how to cook clean and bake. I support myself my son and my mother. I own my own car. If i have a problem I don't run around looking for help first I try to solve it first if I absolutely can not resolve it I will then ask for help. It's off putting to 99.9% of men because I don't need them to save me. That's okay thpugh because I think the fact that I can solely survive on my own is kind of awesome.
15083	Because lord knows when a remaster, that can be done by a small team in a short period of time, is started, what ever game they may be working on is put on hold	No. I want Alan Wake 2.
15084	Which is why police always investigate an accuser before they investigate a criminal.	Doesn't that imply that the person being accused of rape is automatically guilty? Innocent until proven guilty pretty much means that we consider every criminal accusation false till its proven true.
15085	Why, the economy is absolutely booming in spain	It's a miracle!
15086	Hilarious.....	"Fuck her right in the pussy" in front of the whole school
15087	Well because obviously More $$$$ = way better machine ever created ever	Using computers. It's probably why the iDevices are making tons of $$$.
15088	So we are arresting approximately the right number of people.	United States crime rates have fallen 45% since 1990 but incarceration rates have jumped 222%
15089	It's a 30 day holding period.	Interesting, I have experienced the opposite. Right now I can contribute 10% of my salary and sell same day I get the stocks
15090	Or people who don't see a person's color	I bet colorblind people are super sick of their hijinks.
15091	pinch and then claim it was accidental	How would one accidentally pinch?
15092	Yes, violence is the answer.	Now I don't like when players start throwing punches, but that guy had it coming. He talking crap all day, and the first rule about talking crap, is don't talk it to a guy twice your size.
15093	Don't you dare specify genders based on genitalia!	Boys have a penis and girls have a vagina.
15094	Quality content right here.	Steel toe butt lift I recently began a new job which requires me to wear steel toes every day and I'm telling you it transformed my legs/butt within weeks. Make the change - go steel toe
15095	Don't worry NC is moving towards cleaner energy with fracking!	Duke Energy warned about pipe's likelihood to leak in 1986. As much as 78 million pounds of ash spewed out of the pond after a rupture in the pipe flagged 28 years earlier by the two engineers
15096	Well, I've heard that works well when the parents don't have the same rules.	Her mom. My brother will try to discourage her chugging of drinks.
15097	But the CG *totally* made up for it!	Mekakucity Actors wasn't bad it was just inconsistent.

15099	If they riot, I heard the SWAT team will show up with a water cannon, and everyone can just hold up their buckets.	Detroit's Water War: a tap shut-off that could impact 300,000 people
15100	How dare you try to shove your 'tolerance' and equality down every ones throats	MFW an old family friend messages me to tell me my recent fb posts are disturbing (all i've posted in the last month are quiz results, support of equal rights and denouncing H.L. being able to force their religion on others (i support religious freedom, but not putting your views on others)
15101	That's so deep I might drown.	She does something like this every time she dyes her hair.
15102	This guy looks like a Drake wannabe, he is going nowhere.	Young Rapper. Please support his work.
15103	Like, perhaps, a pair of cat handcuffs.	In the first pic, I like how there is clearly a little, simple thing just off-camera, just inspiring the shit out of this guy.
15104	Go full viking, pure bloodlust screaming "VALHALLA" - I'm sure Odin will approve.	You have to die a violent death. Oden judges every death individually.
15105	He could have done anything and people would have still said it's shit, fuck him for doing something new.	I guess I'm the only one who actually thinks the album cover is pretty dope.
15106	Not surprising to see atheist bigotry from you delusional circlejerkers	wasnt much of a friend anyways.
15107	Yes, because Bryan Singer is in control of the costumes and art design on set...	Bryan Singer found a way
15108	Thanks for the great advice	To all who aren't "technically cheating"
15109	Action movies cause crime against men, ban all action movies Food channel cause obesity, ban all food channel GF/BF causes pre-marital sex, ban all conversation between opposite sex ( kudos to you Satyabhama college ) Supreme Court cause stupidity, ban yourself.	'Porn sites cause crime against women': Supreme Court demands immediate action to create a porn-free India
15110	Because she is obviously not old enough to have any opinions of her own.	Little girl speaking out against abortion in front of Canadian Parliament. Opinions that were obviously not produced on her own.
15111	they should just open up the 300 level on the first base line - no need to broadcast the game on the bigscreen - you could just watch w/ binoculars...	Yeah probably wouldn't fill the stadium :-) But, even if they only get 2-5k fans, just open up a couple of the sections. Also helps to keep costs down.
15112	Well, that worked once, why not	"Kick Bone7, Get RTZ, Win TI4" - iceiceice
15113	Is there a number where I could give information in exchange for a reward, cause I think I know where they can find this pervert.	Woody on th news!
15114	Those damn statist liberals always trying to misconstrue the ethics of us logical AnCaps.	Absolutely typical misrepresentation - AnCaps aren't a bunch of creeps who think children should be able to prostitute themselves! They think whoever owns the children should be allowed to prostitute them.
15115	Yeah it's not like there was any bad history between the two, nope not at all	Same would've happened if Benitez had simply lost. Chelsea loves to hate Benitez.

15120	So I guess the 109.5 degree water that the rest of us are drinking is a mixture of the 104 and 114.	Still drinking water with H-bond angle of 104 degrees? (PopSci Jan. 2014)

15122	Well Melo is clearly the better post player and his defense is second to none...	My god...Melo at the 5?
15123	They happen so regularly that there is never an appropriate time.	Still not the time to talk about gun control, right?
15124	And neither ours not theirs changed one bit since then	There's a deleted scene explaining that our computer technology was actually reverse engineered from the alien crashes at Area 51 years ago.

15132	Scrub didn't even try for the 5x5.	Kawhi records an absurd 18-8-4-5-6 stat line Against the Nuggets 18 points (6-14 from the field), 8 rebounds (2 offensive, 6 defensive), 4 assists, 5 steals, **6 blocks**, 1 turnover
15133	You obviously didn't get the memo, he was clearly under direct orders from Putin.	Milonov is a crazy town-wide politician hated even by some intolerant Russians. Western media makes him a huge favour puting him in a spotlight every week .
15134	just what the PL needs, another IF LM	IF Cazorla? Scored 2 so far and if he does he will be at LM.
15135	Bush	boo. spooky scary.
15136	No... what they mean is that they want the kind of country as it was in the time of the constitution....	Is the US Constitution supposed to encompass all culture? that's a head-scratcher right there.

15144	You forget good public transport!	I don't know man... they don't seem to think they are entitled to longer vacation, better work-life balance, and of course some national healthcare.
15145	It's a combination of guns already existing in large amounts, difference in culture, and size of the country.	This is exactly my point, a comparison to the countries of mainland Europe gives a better idea of the actual reasons why outlawing firearms would be difficult in the US. It's more to do with the fact that guns are already omnipresent in the US and in Mexico than being an island nation.

15148	There where something like +30 failed attempts at killing Hitler so maybe someone could turn all of them into a game.	Hell, every level could be a different kill Hitler level and people would play the shit out of that.
15149	As soon as you can think of a better way to allocate resources than capitalism, let us know.	And thus the image of man as parasite is perpetuated. Deplete resources and move on. If it isn't that, it's usually a political tragedy that leads to having abandon wastelands. Either way, it's wasteful.
15150	They all look so.... similar.	Meeting my girlfriend's friends was rough
15151	nice	I can't find the source atm, but you are a fucking retard.
15152	No worries	Just realised I misread what you said, apologies
15153	Remember, if someone disagrees with you it's because TPTB paid them to do it!	I want to thank all the shills. I want to thank you for not being perfect at your job. I want to thank you for inadvertantly proving to the world that you exist. I want to thank all of you that are so bad at your job that you somehow have awoken others. I love you all, shills. Without you, we wouldn't ever know what's really important.
15154	cool, cheers man	I'm down to a 25-30 minute wait to speak to an advisor, will post here to let you know how I get on
15155	but that's no fun!	Well. It'd be polite to say thank you?
15156	I don't believe things can improve at all through the current system, it's corrupt and broken beyond repair.	Because short of a revolution or instigating political reform by joining the system yourself, the only way things will improve is through the current system. My point was that given the range of possible opinions on the myriad subjects in politics, you will probably never find a party with whom you agree on *everything* and disagree with on nothing. So either vote for the one with whom you agree the most or disagree the least.

15160	If only the Founding Fathers hadn't blamed King George for all their difficulties, this country would be in a much better spot.	Old people die. Is that something to worry about? Has blame culture overwhelmed the facts of life?
15161	Angry enough to want to tell other people that they suck even though they have zero impact on their lives, too lazy to do anything but scribble some poorly-spelled dribble on their way to work.	Lol silly women put her tie on wrong. But for reals this is beautiful, though I still don't get the appeal of scrawled illegible hate speech on busses. Seriously how angry can you be?
15162	You say that like Zoe literally sucked off GabeN himself.	Don't forget the blockbuster hit that enchanted audiences, Air Control, and the breakthrough critical success of Zoe Quinn's Depression Quest.
15163	I would be so happy if tOSU never appeared on ESPN again.	The worst part about this is that Mark May got one of his hate based OSU predictions right.

I wish I has 200-300 extra dollars, but I need stuff for college and what not. Anyway I'm considering all these options, oh how is hight points quality of firearms, I've seen many mixed reviews?

15173	this kind of tax will tax much more than just the rich	Doesn't hurt the economy to raise taxes on those who weren't really affected by the recession or bounced back. The richest among us have been out of the recession for a few years now it's everyone else who can't find a job. Best way to get us out of this is probably to tax the people who have it and higher all the public workers back we've fired over the last few years while building up our infrastructure.
15174	Error 420 - too much Leeroy	I have no idea, happens to me about daily when I stream(even if I dont dc) I am from NA, so if I play on Asia or EU this happens a bit. Not like a lose a turn or anything.

15176	Congrats and Good Luck!	I'm getting married tomorrow. Full sun forecast for Auckland, winning!
15177	Because you said so.	A complete contradiction of your previous statement is what it is. The number of gun owners in a country has pretty much zero influence on gun-related crimes.
15178	mods are sleeping.... no ?	Saar, self promotion is not allowed in randia.
15179	Jetstar is owned by QANTAS	I hope you're right, for the crewman's sake. Qantas leadership (I have mates at Qantas) have their sense of humour surgically removed when they join the org and are notorious arseholes when it comes to coming down like a sack of shit for public embarrassments. I'm sure Jetstar is no different.

15197	Right, because it's obviously impossible for them to do both.	I'll be the cranky one. O-Line, less practicing funny skits, how about pass protection and run blocking.

15201	Should have gotten bluray	I learnt this from cops. Saw an episode where a guy went to get his dvd player from his ex, she attacked him with a knife, then he called the cops. Cops show up, guy is calm and collected, chick is flippin out; hes bloody, shes fine and the cop says to the woman, "so you mean to tell me you were afraid for your life so you attacked him?" She says yes, hes arrested and never gets his dvd player.

15206	I would bet my entire life savings that it won't crack $300 million domestically.	I think Guardians has a chance. It's riding the Marvel Universe wave, so all the people following the story through the various movies will go see it, even if the movie itself holds minimal interest for them. not a sure thing but there's hope.
15207	These have got to be some of the most organized, well equipped rebels without outside assistance I have ever seen.	Rebels have captured Lugansk airport. Rebel airstrike has destroyed 6 Ukrainian tanks

15209	The use of the word "something," of course, indicates that the woman is literally a "thing."	By the by, you actually used the phrase "something I can't have" to describe a woman, so if you're still curious how it turned into that, that's how.

15229	Atticus was the best part of the movie i really liked his character i mean he outran a tsunami and saved a child was Pompeii the best movie no but i have seen worse movies	Anyone saw Pompeii (2014)? Let's talk about it! (SPOILERS) So my friends made me see Pompeii in 3D. The film in my opinion was a huge miss and I will forget I even watched this movie because nothing stood out in the movie. It is so obvious what was going to happen. Kiefer Sutherland and Kit Harington star in this flop movie. The effects and the music were good, but the acting and the storyline was lacking. And I just realized that the poster for Pompeii that is on IMDb is actually from the last scene of the movie. So you don't even need to watch the movie you can just look at the poster and you know what will happen. Kiefer Sutherland accent was terrible and he should stick to what he knows which is playing Jack Bauer and shooting people with a gun. What did you think of the movie?

15237	If they don't feed her that's elder abuse!	They have to go through the formal eviction process to get her out (in my area if you let someone stay with you for at least 10 days you'd have to) but there is no reason they should be letting this woman eat their food.
15238	No, you may not laugh at my jokes.	25 us - feeling a little lonely I'm independent. Healthy. Have a career. I like learning things. I like trying new things. Sometimes I make bold and impulsive decisions. I have thoughts and opinions. I'm dainty and feminine. I know my way around a toolbox. I'm blunt. I'm sweet. I have thick skin. I'm lonely. I want someone who I can talk to throughout the day. Someone I look forward to hearing from. I want to really know someone and I want to really be known. The good parts. The bad ones. Heartache. Failures. Share every secret. Let me tell you what terrifies me. Let me laugh at your jokes.
15239	lol you went to reddit before trying to go into another portal...what the actual fuck?	B) worked, thanks man.
15240	Yeah it's such a turn-on when dudes talk like a 3 year old demanding an ice cream cone.	"I wanna BJ!"
15241	Clearly tolerance is not a two-way street...	In light of an earlier article about employee protests: OKCupid asks users to boycott Firefox because of CEO's gay rights stance
15242	Well, we were all thinking it.	Fox congratulates UConn on "NAACP" national championship
15243	No no, those definitely had their run in the Gillis is fired thread.	Cue jokes about Messier coming in to steal his job.
15244	I really hope they make the deadline, seems like it will be tough to finish the bikes in time!	Azeroth Choppers -- Episode 2
15245	Disgaea 4... Shit I need this	Persona 4, Metal Gear Solid 2/3 HD, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Gravity Rush, PS All Stars, Virtue's Last Reward, Hotline Miama, Disgaea 4. Tearaway is coming out soon, which is gonna be awesome.
15246	By breaking the game to a state where it excepts arbitrary code and writing said code into memory then executing it... simple!	Ummm How does this work?
15247	Should have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps as the flood came.	Only poor countries have massive natural disasters. This is because, unlike me, they are stupid. You wait and see. We'll kick back and watch the destruction on our plasmas.
15248	i dont see a problem.	This sure passes inspection
15249	But really guys, lets not use up all of our good luck on that kind of a crazy wish!	would be more grateful for free online play on it.
15250	Wow so many mechanics, such a complex and deep game, many combinations.	exactly, thing is people say shield is OP without realising tesla does double damage to it, so many mechanics behind this game that people don't want to put effort in to learn so cry p2w and quit
15251	Nah probably modern shit like Justin Bieber and Katy Perry	Neighbor probably listens to litt[le] gayne.
15252	Yeah, it should be a condo instead!	Has no one else been on that street? The Bootstore stares at the asshole of The Atrium. You will be sitting on a patio staring at courier, delivery and garbage trucks loudly backing in and out all day long. Workers from the building out back on their smoke breaks. The endless traffic of cars trying to turn onto Yonge St. Terrible idea.
15253	Ah look exactly the way Gingers are treated in the UK!	Pussy Riot attacked with whips by Cossack militia at Sochi Olympics
15254	So Adlington, now that you have revealed your face, should Etho do the same?	Adlington &amp; Vermontious: Speed Art
15255	We don't even know if Etho have a face yet	I want Team DOOKE! D - We've seen his face OO - We've seen his face too K - Yes E - ...Well... Nevermind
15256	Yes because internet petitions will change the world!	or start a petition which really isnt that difficult
15257	Yeah, but then how would A&amp;E make money?	I would be willing to bet this method of prevention fails against a control group in a basic scientific study. I would also be willing to bet that a method where the inmates calmly sit down 1 on 1 and explain how shitty life is inside the jail, might beat this Scared Straight method.
15258	You should start doing ports as soon as you can in order to get crew members, ship and building upgrades, and scrolls.	How long will it take to get full sea singer's? I wish to get 90 RC for full sea singer's, but that will be my only 90 production stat. Is it worth it?
15259	Sweet you know Kevin too?	'Boon' kinda-sorta makes sense, I can go with that. However, I am disappoint cuz only one and weirded out a little cuz you look a lot like my friend Kevin.
15260	I agree that they should be dealt with but priorities dictate that one protect one's self before protecting others.	See, that's a selfish view on politics. Just because one doesn't directly attack the U.S. doesn't mean we ignore them. We should be helping all the oppressed however possible, as we have the resources, and just removing the region that attacks us in particular does nothing. Besides, it is just the extremists anyway. Do you not care about Boko Haram?
15261	Reddit can suck one, every black girl I know is pretty awesome, and I'm your average white dude!	I'm a black lady. Reddit thinks I'm some sort of twerking and loud hellion. Then again, the majority of society thinks this.
15262	I just watched boat trip and it was more enduring the second time around.	Gay movies that don't suck? Aside from *Weekend*, *Shelter*, and *Happy Together*?
15263	You missed so much, dude.	oh ok for some reason i was thinking after. i played all the other ones though just not san andreas
15264	you can see the ref in the clip signal over to the Cowboys sideline how short he is.	oh. I didn't watch the game, only saw the vine. I thought they were bringing out the chains.
15265	This is what they do to you when you forget to take your laptop out of your bag.	Serious full body scanning at Ohare airport security. I took this picture while waiting in line - it probably is someone doing maintenance, but it is pretty funny to see a pair of legs sticking out of the X-ray machine.
15266	we pretty much got NCR, NWM and SCR are similarly far for most in norcal	Well, he's from Norcal. Other than NCR and maybe NWM, can you think of many right in that area?
15267	He should have been a model.	Houston Rockets' Chandler Parsons

15273	Will the unicorn be pink and fluffy?	Will Scotland keep the Unicorn as the national animal if we vote yes, due to the fact it is for the Royal Coat of Arms?
15274	Because adding "lmao" totally makes it okay.	I got a Facebook message from my insurance agent
15275	that would be a del *.mp3	Maybe it would be possible to have a script, or something scan for *.mp3 files and what not, and delete them. Unless people need to store audio files on there.
15276	That's life	It's weird to me how different the opinions on here are from the ones I see in real life.
15277	By clogging up traffic at rush hour?	FWD: FWD: FWD: WHO ELSE IS A STRAIGHT JESUS LOVING GUN OWNER?
15278	"Yes, yes, byte me, byte me!"	The safe word is "404".
15279	That could have gone much more horribly wrong.	100-foot drop in a snowmobile. Crazy.
15280	thanks!	There is a text installer. (I see it all the time with my installations on serial console only virtual machines.) Add 'text' to the kernel command line when booting the installer, just like before, according to what I'm reading. It's very close to the hub-spoke model that the current installer uses so I'm not sure you'll find it to be much different.
15281	fertilizer for the grass to grow quicker creating job security for the goats.	What about all the poop?
15282	I mean yeah, if you just ignore the half of the country that disagrees with you, everyone thinks the same as you!	If you completely ignore population density the USA is mostly Republican!
15283	That's fair, I was thinking more people that have only like 15lbs to lose.	I agree. I like to do sit-ups push-ups light weights and ballet exercises for my legs. I'm just talking about little things, or in my case (and I'm sure a lot of women) imaginary things. Like I know in my head my thighs are not huge but I'll always hate them and think they're too big. Always.
15284	Inflation is just the average of price increases.	Well, yes. Not all price increases are caused by inflation.
15285	I misread this and was REALLY confused.	Okay Bruins just gobble some fat clock and walk out of here.
15286	which happens to be how much you need to invest at 5% interest to have a perpetuity in which you collect n dollars per year where n is the number of years.	[420]

15290	I'd like to take Jews for $1000, Alex.	When Palestinians used violence as a form of opposition, an author's wife paid the price. So now he's championing Palestinians' use of nonviolent opposition (boycotts). For this, his book events are being cancelled. In America.
15291	I am proud of your words.	I'm proud to say choo choo.
15292	that is a different story....we have our own reasons to hate each other	Nah... but the chinese use mongolian as an insult
15293	Man you sir showed him who's immature with this comment	He is a big baby and every one knows it. A big baby mouse.
15294	but it doesn't sync comments so its pretty much useless	Caches reddit for offline use.
15295	Fuck you no one needed to know this..	TIL: "Bicep" is a false singular. "Biceps" is the singular and "bicepses" is the plural.
15296	Except everyone that plays a support champion?	Said no League of Legend player ever.
15297	TIL Creatine=HGH	Oh you'll notice the effects soon enough. I gained 50lbs of lean muscle from creatine in two months. Some say I might give Phil Health a run for his money at the Olypmia. If you want to be an IFBB pro keep taking it and also take fish oil it thins out your skin to make you look leaner.
15298	oh that's terrific	HIV-positive teacher uses male-only app Grindr to hook up with 15-year-old McKinney boy
15299	OK, that's super creepy.	i never even gave him my adress. so its really stalkey(?)
15300	We are no Warmduschers.	Why is the water temperature at German Wellness Centers/Thermal Baths so low? I live in Bad Durkheim and recently went to the wellness center with a thermal bath and I was shocked to find the warmest tub they had was only 36 degrees Celsius. Is this normal? That is like body-temperature. I am used to jacuzzi/hot-tub/onsen water at close to 43 degrees Celsius and I did not find the luke-warm water to be very pleasant. Can anyone explain?
15301	It's a big step up for you guys in that regard, last season the keeper would be missing an ear!	Way to not retaliate Balo. Good job.
15302	I'm sure he wouldn't need to carry a gun if it wasn't for gun nuts like on this sub.	GETTING AWAY WITH IT: Gun Control Activist Who Swore He Forgot He Was Packing Heat At School Gets JOKE Sentence
15303	nothing made me happier than hearing my perfect, fragile flower girlfriend (who doesn't fart) say that she pees in the shower.	MRW when my SO is shocked to find out women pee in the shower
15304	Tell that to my ex girlfriend	Depressed people aren't usually mopey, emo kids, sitting around whining. Most of them get up and go to work every day, laugh at jokes, tell jokes, take care of their children, etc... They just feel empty inside while they're doing all that.
15305	Because woman are delicate creatures	Why did no one sucker punch the woman?
15306	Blood identification required before online play available...	Got the new MadCatz extension for my Wii U
15307	Such is the nature of powerful nations that war is inevitable.	TIL that since becoming a nation 238 years ago, the US has been in conflict or at war approximately 90% of the time.
15308	Look at the rich guy splurging on the Acer C720 when you can get the Asus C200, which is fanless, has better build quality, a better screen and 2-3 hours more battery life	I never understood getting a macbook air when you can get the c720 chromebook for $150 now lol
15309	No, I'm a self-hating Jew when I point these things out, though... because the need for a Jewish state obviously trumps human rights	The many denials of liberal Zionism
15310	You dropped this:	This is police brutality. Just another officer perpetuating the police state.
15311	But that would make them slaves!	I believe that's called "employment".
15312	No way it could be sloppy conditions and sub par equipment, it is obviously the government lying to us about how it is transmitted.	Dallas nurses cite sloppy conditions in Ebola care: "were forced to use medical tape to secure openings in their flimsy garments and worried that their necks and heads were exposed as they cared for Duncan."
15313	I'd take a free house right now.	My first thought was that I'd rather use that money for a down payment on a house, but that may be because my mommy and daddy haven't already bought me one.
15314	wouldn't understanding it be sort of like appropriating the culture?	What, you expect them to actually understand the culture they're criticizing?
15315	Think I saw this guy in one of the Hellraiser movies?	Some kind of children toy (?!)
15316	Could you do john wick?	after i get dallas' done i will work on every single mask any requests ?
15317	am giants fan, can confirm i think about nothing besides wishing i were a dodger fan....	If my team were in the World Series, the SF Giants would be the last thing on my mind. I'd be wayyyyy to excited and happy to go through the trouble of making a sign like this to take to a game. I think that pretty much sums up *some* Giants fans. They are simply way too preoccupied thinking of us to be happy about their own team.
15318	nice, do you ball anywhere around town?	Yup, starting my senior year in the fall.
15319	Because everyone in Africa has Ebola	Might wanna get checked out.
15320	Eating disorders are so fun	490 lbs. woman making a meatloaf in bed.
15321	Yes, but that $746 figure *could have been* $833.	The RET is not a scapegoat
15322	that gif is 50 mbs.. you even compress bro?	Massive Russian hovercraft landing on a beach
15323	But it's wine, it's classy!	It's also blatant classism, that they look down on lager drinkers, demonise alcopops and Bacardi Breezers, then have regular features on wine and as you say, a Mail wine club. 'Why limit yourself to 12 bottles, buy multiple cases for a discount! - Oh look at those teenagers binge drinking, disgusting!'
15324	Public universities should have to comply with the laws of their respective state, as well as relevant federal laws.	It should be up to the college to decide whether fire arms are allowed on their campus, not the state's decision.
15325	Mary Anne in *The Things They Carried*--her transformation seems so positive at first, and then gets so very, very dark.	Who are some of your favorite secondary characters in literature? One character I really adore is Sissy from A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Perhaps it's because we first see her through Francie's eyes, but I think the author did a wonderful job of making her something more than what her less-than-perfect reputation would suggest. She's probably the most endearing character in the book for me.
15326	Finally!	You Can Now Play Flappy Bird On The Apple II
15327	Well damn, nice console graphics you have there...	My Skyrim Confession
15328	Yep because 9/11 was completely religiously motivated.	This is gonna crash and burn when America wakes up.

15332	He clearly meant Zionists.	Maybe the complaint system is hit/miss. I reported a comment a few weeks ago that was something along the lines of "death to the jews" and within an hour, I got a reply telling me thanks and the comment was deleted.
15333	Fucking triggers, shitlord.	I felt violated reading this.
15334	He certainly has a wide vocabulary!	hi
15335	Good luck.	we in the US do have our fair share of folks who are afraid of guns and want to see them banned so we can live in a world of rainbows and Lolli pops.
15336	Ah yes, because California is obviously the most water-needy place in the world	Not to mention, it's also wasting thousands of gallons of water that California desperately needs
15337	Obviously Salmond is going to swap out FM for Eternal President after a Yes vote.	Senior SNP source: 'This will be one of Salmond's last FMQs.'
15338	Yeah brah, I think it's obvious that the problem is because republicans something something something something Obama just couldn't get it past them.	Nah, they still won't listen. They will just beg for more government on top of it all. "Why didn't we go single payer" type crap.
15339	It's b/c people are lazy and would like for him to copy and paste the information along with citations.	How are you being downvoted when the entirety of your post is a citation that was requested? I don't... I don't get this website.
15340	I have an iphone 3s that still looks new and is as fast as wife's 4 or 5 or something (for calls and messages) just a giant scam	I've had my phone for almost two years now and it's in perfect condition. I don't understand this.
15341	Well then fuck you too sir.	I agree about the officiating, on both sides. Wild got screwed in game 5. But I absolutely do not wish you one iota of luck. I hope all of the pucks that catch iron bounce our way, I hope parise breaks his stick on a well placed 1-timer. I hope this series has 0 overtimes and we win in 4 and get the maximum rest between series. So no sir, I wish you terrible luck!
15342	Oh well that doesn't warrant a vet visit at all.	Oh and The mutt has a bad limp but that's it
15343	Sometimes when i stand for a very long time i wished a hero like him would come to my aid.	"Thought I was doing u a favor" (resubmitted)
15344	Obviously because it's all metal, guys!	How could specific, descriptive genre names be problematic to someone discovering new bands or discussing those genres?
15345	Well, men are obviously the cause of all these problems, so they're not allowed to complain about them.	**Reason that people are mad and the vote pattern is so weird ITT**: frogman has recently been very active on the social justice sphere and has been saying some incredibly stupid things. Likening men to a handful of m&amp;ms that contains one poisonous one, and belittling a male sexual assault victim based on his gender.
15346	This is dark souls, screw the new people!	Complexity and depth are different, and it is depth that we want, not complexity, having multiple movesets per weapon sounds to be the former rather than latter. The problem with PvP lacking diversity is because of people's tendency to choose the most efficient setup, and/or the common idea of "cool" (ie katana are cool), so adding extra movesets wouldn't improve the diversity as much as a good balanced playing field would. People will still go for the best weapon with the best moveset, the extra fanciness may just end up confusing newcomers instead. Though... This is likely what I would've said about power stancing before the game!
15347	We already know it's the best, no need to seek justification.	Not one USA yet. Impressive.
15348	Damn, you seem like someone who truly understands and cares for younger people, you're probably a great teacher with an excellent relationship with your students, you do a great job of inspiring people to want to learn.	It's not the lack of knowledge but the attitude. "Why should I give a shit about them?" are the words of a loser.
15349	I wonder if they'll walk around shows with aprons from their workers on instead of ones they bought off etsy.	This probably sounds ridiculous and conspiracy-esque but here is what I think happened and will happen moving forward: OSB owners realize they need a factory of their own. They allow PWM to fail even though they could likely support PWM financially if they wanted to (I believe that OSB has previously helped pay Highland payroll, no source on this, ask Robot). PWM tries to shop itself to BH. Either PWM is not worthy of being purchased by BH in the first place or the OSB owners somehow sway BH (this is all predicated on the speculation that OSB owners own BH stock) against acquiring PWM. This move caused PWM to shut down operations as they cannot find a buyer opening the door for OSB to purchase the factory after PWM shutters up so that they can acquire it as cheap as possible.
15350	Nothing more attractive than a person begging for your attention and using baby talk.	My friend met this guy briefly on a cruise around a year ago. Today he contacted her and this is what happened when she didn't respond for three minutes.
15351	Her hand is in two of them so she's obviously an attention whore just like all women.	...Except only one picture was like that, and the other one with her in it had her operating machinery, not taking a selfie.
15352	Nope, just trying to beat every team except the kings, sens, and stars.	Conspiring to beat the Kings this year, eh?
15353	Bitch please 420ZZ	im like a 69DD cant beat that
15354	Even when the episode aired I disagreed with it.	What we do with recycling has greatly improved since the episode aired.
15355	But knowing Tumblr, they're not going to recognize that it's their own posts being turned against them and doxx the person posting the "Jailbreak the Patrairchy" post.	Damn. That's a really good way of having it just click how fucked up what they're saying is.
15356	no way, the marklar thing is SO FUNNY and makes this community so much better!	If only my username was not Marklar on this thread...

15360	Reading burns calories right?	I think she has a beef^teehee with reading because it says all sorts of nasty, fat-shaming things like eat healthy and maybe move around a little sometimes.

15366	Yes great point, because all know that poor people are really just lazy people.	Here we go again. A bunch of people that refuse to do anything to better themselves suggesting that instead of actually putting in some elbow grease on their skillset, they should be handed a higher standard of life at the whim of the government.

15370	Still very bad ass.	Indeed. They're blunt tip though.
15371	That's because there are much less players in Basketball than there are in baseball.	kobe and duncan are top-10 players ever. jeter isn't even close to that.
15372	That seems like a really good opportunity to sue a major company, and make yourself a shit-load of money.	As I told the others, while it can be helpful, it also leads to companies putting gluten free on things that are not actually gluten free. I've gotten sick several times from this. Things will say gluten free on it but will have an ingredient that isn't explicitly labeled as gluten but is still gluten. MSG being an example of this that I have found.
15373	Advantages: * Piston system keeps fouling/burnt powder up front and not fed back into the bolt area * Simpler to manufacture * No need for a buffer assembly Disadvantages: * Weight... the DI system on the AR-15 can be very light, but the AR-18 system isn't much heavier	If you don't mind me asking, what advantages/disadvantages does this have over the ar15 platform?

15396	I don't get why Qatar doesn't just deport them..	According to the article, the US gov. has been trying to get Qatar to both lift the travel ban and has been actively questioning the prosecution in general. This is just the first 'public statement' that they've had regarding the case.

15398	Unless there are subsidies like in Europe it's not cost effective	I am surprised that solar hasn't caught on more widely at the household level in india, especially for those wanting to go off grid.
15399	That I can agree with 100%!	You are right performance is key. DirectX has better shaders, but worse performance. OpenGL has decent shaders, but better performance.
15400	If you hate the VK3601, you're going to *love* the Tiger I.	I have the VK right now and honestly, both guns suck. The tank just kinda sucks. * Its slow * Its armor is shitty * It has crappy guns * It can't brawl * It has good HP; however, see bullet point #2 I am saving free xp to entirely skip this POS.

15406	My experience with obs was terrible but I'm sure that was a standalone instance.	Mantle allows me to go to 90 FPS, 1080p on Ultra, bf4, while without it I was only hitting ~70 on high. Also, ShadowPlay is easily replaced by Open Broadcaster Software. PhysX can be done on the CPU, but you needy a beefy one, preferably overclocked, and you'll miss out on a few features of it, but Borderlands 2 has full CPU PhysX support, for example. Game streaming though.. Someone needs to make an addon for OBS that can stream to phones/tablets. :c
15407	Special forces maps were amazing, i don't understand why DICE thinks we don't want night maps back...	That was the night map that had the long winding road up the island right? That map was absolutely fantastic. The defenders had a great set up. I loved being at the top of the map and zip lining down.
15408	Ringo's floor tom was also tuned super low, which is great for using it in ride patterns.	Yep, they probably used an Opto compressor with a 4:1 or 6:1 ratio and set the release real fast. Great for drums because optos are slow, so the kick and snare still come through a bunch but the decay gets squeezed super hard. They were probably getting a shitload of reduction like 10 dB. People often don't realize how compressed the Beatles recordings were, but that's what made them really stand out. They sounded so punchy.

Location could be in the city or even in the Coseley/Bilston area. I'm looking for hip-hop records so I need a shop that stocks a lot of that, but am also open to picking up some older Pink Floyd, Slade or Jazz/Blues records. Primarily hiphop though. Thanks in advance :)
15414	Couldn't find the .gif so video it was.	For future reference that "longer gif" is called a video :P I love its attention span in that video though "BLINDS! GET THEM OFF! OWNER! WILL OWNER DO ANYTHING? HEY WAIT, BLINDS!"

15426	Well of course AMERICAN Express isn't accepted in the UK.	I live in the UK and have an AmEx card for work expenses. It does seem like very few places take it. You're in luck if it's a chain. If it's a little local place? That's a gamble. I've never seen an AmEx that isn't for expenses. Also, Amex advertisements confuse the hell out of me.

15441	I think weed should be legal therefore I can pretend it is and do whatever i want!	All these rumors are retarded. I was on the floor in TA. Some drunk kid was slamming on doors trying to get into kids rooms talking about smoking up asking for weed and when campo showed up, he ran and then tried to fight with them. They brought him outside for the police and then he was even trying to fight with police. He's an idiot and going to be expelled after something like that. All these rumors I think are being started by these potheads who are pissed because public safety cracked down on their smoking.

Personally my favorite arc is the Chimera Ant arc, but close second is the Yorknew City Arc because I remember watching it back in the day and remembering how BAD ASS that Kurapika vs Uvogin fight was. I mean seriously, did anyone else expect Kurapika to level up from fucking 12 to 85, that shit was amazing! But anyways, I would like to hear your opinions!

15447	I think tulpas have legitimately gone out of fashion in the SJW community, otherkin and headmates still get posted, but I think the number of laughs one can generate out of someone insisting they're actually a dragon/narwhal with 30 people living in them is limited.	There are fewer otherkin, headmates, and tulpas posted, now. Its mostly radfems, racists, and pro-fatties, now. Much less fun. Did those other strains of craycray die out, or do we just post fewer of them? Still, decline or no, this subreddit is one of the least crass examples of a place for poking fun at people. The comment section is quite readable. Some subs start to feel like YouTube comments after a while.

15472	This is why I'm still waiting for a audiobook style reading of Elder Scrolls books.	The Elder Lore series is an audio podcast that explores topics a bit more in-depth than shoddy. Start there if you want. But know that the lore is fundamentally literature - if you really want to know it fully, you have to read it for yourself. It's a pile of documents. No amount of listening to other people will replace reading said documents.
15473	But if the senators have nothing to hide, what's the problem ?	I'm less annoyed about the hypocrisy, and more concerned that the crux of the issue is that the CIA is basically saying they dont need to submit to congressional oversight, which is body that regulates them. It sets a dangerous precedent that if the CIA wants to do something, it can simply not comply, or remove documents that are incriminating with no repercussions.

15480	Well you see, every straight cis male is born a rapist and it is only by being raped himself that he can reach salvation and get welcomed in the holy halls of tumblr.	It's funny (read: fucking stupid) that if it's a girl getting raped, I'm sure she would talk about how awful it is and how they don't deserve it and all of that, which is true, but when it's some straight white dude, he totally deserves it. I don't understand how the fuck people can think that way and not see any problem with it. That side of tumblr makes me want to gouge my eyes out. Rape is never okay, and nobody ever deserves it and these kinds of thoughts make me so mad.
15481	Calm down, Quantum's boatload of money is on the way.	It may not be surprising, but it's worrying none the less. If they're struggling to find $2m to pay their entry fee, then how are they going to find the $5-10m (or more) to pay for their engines? Is this the real reason they're missing the first test, they can't afford to pay their bills? In the mean time they've lost large sections of their technical team, their star driver has been replaced by a "less respected" one, they're already committed to missing 1/3rd of the pre-season testing, they've yet to even announce their engine partner, their big sponsorship hope at the end of last season was a hoax, and they were reported as being very late in starting their 2014 car. Hopefully the cheque will arrive soon from Maldonado's backers but until then there's a very real risk we're not going to see Lotus at the track and that even if they do make it to the grid they could very well struggle for pace.
15482	Yeah because BTTF did Time Travel first...	Because of possible lawsuits because of back to the future?
15483	NO, HE'S JUST DOING THIS TO GET FANS, HE'S FAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!	Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of Jones, but this definitely scored him some points in my eyes, even more if it actually comes through! Hell, the UFC could even take advantage of friendly exhibitions like this by putting them on the UFC Fight Pass. We'd potentially get to see some more "behind the scenes" or "for fun" action like this if they put some effort into it.

15488	Idk, based on you post they don't seem any more self-righteous than any other young idealistic group of politically aware people - libertarians included.	Discuss away. I just had to share what I felt was a very odd situation. I should have made it clear that they were doing this against school policy. What surprised the most was how righteous they seemed.
15489	What's the point of Christmas and presents if *I* don't get something?	Right now, all the SS posts are the good hauls. Wait a couple weeks and you'll start seeing the crap, the gag gifts, the "I never got a gift" posts. And those are the reason so many people don't bother, because it sucks to put in a lot of effort, if not money, and get jack shit (or literal shit) in return.

If you want to run an oil line through my property, you'd better be willing to clean it up, or at least compensate me for the clean-up. And you'll keep cleaning it until it's clean to my satisfaction, no cutting corners!

15509	lol	What expense? Just play the game. "Cheesing" is not cheating so nothing wrong with it.
15510	Wasn't funny - punch line needs work	Absolutely. Funny story: when we were sorting the slate floor for my patio, we wanted the shades of color to appear randomly distributed. But truly "random", as in simply laying down whatever was in the stack, appears not at all to be random. We spent considerable time, laying every single piece out in advance, before mortering them, to evenly distribute the colors. In the end, it looked random, but was anything but.
15511	Most of the time, pepper spray is used on its owner because the owner has generally not prescribed with it and the attacker is able to take it from them	Why no weapons? I fairly confident my Sig Sauer can scream louder than both you and I can. Again why no weapons? Do you expect your attacker to not have a weapon? Why not have an equal or greater defensive capability to your attackers offense?
15512	&amp;gt;I need to get to someone who cares enough about me to protect me Sooooooooo.... no one?	Realistically, have a panic attack and waste my final hour sobbing on the floor. If by some miracle I managed to pull myself together, I'd figure out which direction the zombies were coming from, drive in the opposite direction, and stay with whichever relative I got to first. No way in hell am I surviving a zombie apocalypse for more than a day or two on my own. I need to get to someone who cares enough about me to protect me.

15515	Cleaner's Carbine is like the Eyelander, but because the stock SMG is so fucking bad as it is, it's pretty rare that you can pull off the first kill to get the mini-crits anyway.	Cleaners carbine and tribalmans shiv aren't bad though.
15516	Its so good, but you're right, they're only in California, Oregon and Washington.	There's a chain called Veggie Grill, but I think it's only on the US west coast right now.

15518	Being an elo booster in season 1 and 2 where Riot wasn't strictly enforcing the rules is not the same thing as being an elo booster in season 4 where people have been permabanned for elo boosting.	Pretty much every pro player was an elo booster.

15526	Yep, they are using all the power for graphics	We're playing on the most powerful consoles yet and they don't have split-screen multiplayer because of a technical limitation?

15529	I've never played PS1, but that sounds amazing.	I remember little get-togethers like this in PS1. Usually for trading for other faction's weapons/ammo.
15530	DAE think lesbians just need to try dick to make sure they really aren't sexually available to me?	Ever let him have a ride just to make sure you're still gay? If he has loved you for years... you should at least let em break off a piece.
15531	prenups still put you at the mercy of a family court judge, which do not tend to go the man's way	What about a pre nup? Thats always been my plan.
15532	well done on understanding the issue as little as humanly possible i guess if they want business they should stop price gouging us its really as simple as that very few people actually care whether downloading is right or wrong, theyre going to do it until theres a real alternative	Good. Something needs to be done. If you download a movie or TV show without paying for it then that is theft. Plain and simple. If something of yours was stolen you would like the theif to be punished which is the same as what the copyright holder of a stolen movie wants. A lot of people for some reason feel they are entitled to something they are not simply because it isn't made available in a particular market. VPN or not - the bottom line is if you download movies illegally you are a thief. The same people also argue that copyright law should be changed simply so they feel that their actions are justifiable and therefore legal. The Pirate Party is a perfect example of this. Even their name suggests it.
15533	god dammit ive told all my coworkers about this and completely forgot to go -_- wtf	Here are a few quick and dirty snapshots I took at the 2014 SF Valentine's Day pillow fight. There's nothing great 'cuz I took my nephew and had to keep an eye on him (we stuck to the mellow northern fringe area), but if you recognize someone, they might get a kick out of seeing their photo.
15534	Yeah, much worse than female groupies	can't stand male groupies. lol
15535	Freedom is *so* overrated	Spacey has been forever burned into my mind as Frank Underwood. He's got such a cold, ruthlessness to him. Kevin Spacey would be a good Templar.
15536	Because having spawn is a GUARANTEE they will take care of you	Then you die miserable and alone with no one to take care of you.
15537	Vista was fine if you were okay with UAC popping up every time you wanted to do something other than copy files from one directory to another.	I think that "general trend" only works if you pick specific versions of Windows to make it work for you. XP was pretty awful until a couple of service packs had been released. Vista was fine if your hardware was modern enough to have decent drivers. By the time 7 came out most vendors had got their act together (or people had upgraded their hardware) which may be why it has been better received in spite of not being very different to Vista. Working backwards you then need to pick whether you jump from 9x to NT with 2000 or stick with Me, and whether you treat 98 (crap) and 98SE (the version that worked) as separate entities or not.
15538	Can't even 2h it :( I was hitting with an unmodded reinforced club, my buddy was hitting with a dagger.	Need 10 dex to wield the drake sword.
15539	it wouldn't have gotten so popular if it weren't for breaking bad	That's true, that's true. Although I think meth is everywhere now.
15540	But decks without Sure Gamble aren't competitive!	+1 for mentioning Sure Gamble, there's no way it makes it into a Nasir deck but a lot of people will try anyway.
15541	I always wanted to drink that blue space milk.	Didn't they got banned because of the blue coloring? At any rate, I understand that they're still available in some parts of Asia. I miss them. I used to mix Pepsi Blue with milk to get that Star Wars Blue Milk. Tastes great. I want my Pepsi Blue back. :(
15542	Yeah where is the gamecube controller...	My girlfriend secretly bought a bunch of controllers and made this for me for my birthday!
15543	After JFF Graduated:The Texas A&amp;M Circle Jerk is over Today: LONG LIVE THE TEXAS A&amp;M CIRCLE JERK	3 stats you probably haven't heard about from the Texas A&amp;M game
15544	It's Co-Jo.	Who do I believe?? Yours makes more sense with the actual correct letters
15545	8 Barely Legal Ninja Wives - The Sword Master Ftfy	Barely Legal Ninja Wives 8 - The Sword Master
15546	Yeah, you're right, the only two options are jabbing a toddler in the eye and getting rid of the dog.	then i guess they have to get rid of the dog
15547	I don't know, there was something pretty magical about Tom Cruise telling me to respect the cock.	It IS his best performance in any role.
15548	yea getting a big company involved will make things all better	So I'm curious what's next contact DC Comics?
15549	It's just a 200-year-old piece of paper.	It's not complicated. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. There really isn't grey area. The argument was settled long, long ago.
15550	wut	5N7FjH.gif ( 320)
15551	If those kids can jump on top of a table at city Council maybe they'll be heard!	can find a spot for them but not us
15552	He could be doing the second campaign mission...	theres no other way. He probably has over 1 million donates
15553	"try saving" - I think you mean ALWAYS save as .png	Looks pretty sharp to me. You could try saving it as a PNG so no quality is lost.
15554	Ah, right.	No official outfit. I just bought a black tux with a black military hat. We'll see how far my luck runs with this gag...
15555	He's got us now!	Awesome! Now, what do you plan to do so that you don't have these same irrational feelings over other things?
15556	thats a waste you cant see over 720p anyways	Putting your glasses on is like going from 480p to 1080p
15557	I didnt see that	The huge UFO in the street doesn't give you a clue? It was added by a script kiddie, the hitbox on it extends further than the model.
15558	Where the hell am I gonna get 300 rockets?	SGA: The most important weapon you bring to the raid... is your heavy Bring a 300 rocket with you to the raid. The biggest problem I see from running hard mode is that guardians aren't properly equipped. No, your ice breaker is not enough. Please, make your life and the lives of your fire team better by bringing a high damage rocket launcher and some heavy synth. Here's why: 1. A rocket gives you an instant clear during confluxes, basically acting as a restart if things get out of control. 2. You need to be able to solo a minotaur and even a praetorian by yourself, a high level rocket makes this trivial (rockets really do that much damage). 3. The gatekeeper phase gets out of control if portal teams go too slow. Rockets make the whole process more fluid as you blast the gatekeeper into oblivion. And yes... it's better than using your ice breaker. Please come prepared to the raid. Your light level is not enough, you need weapons to match. Your primary is for trash and your heavy is for when you need to really do work. Throw pretty much any sniper on for a special to shoot hobs (any legendary no ascendant mat sniper will 1 shot hobs even on hard).
15559	Nah nobody has mentioned it yet.	Fellini has been reborn hard. Not sure if anyone has said much on this yet. I think since his return he's finally living up to his price tag. I wonder what LvG said to him?
15560	You mean you aren't down for that DISCREET fun ~~OP~~ Lamey McLamey?	"YA GOTZ NOTHING ON MEH BITCH..."
15561	If you can remember it, it wasn't that severe.	I had to do that concussions are no fucking joke like I used to think...until you have a severe concussion then you have no idea what the pain is like
15562	Must be why your win% is shit	funny how there are players you see frequently but are never your teammates. i feel like I'm always on the opposite team when playing with zexer, runthajewels, and skwid
15563	It's ok, the stockings cover her up.	grl I'd be sad too
15564	And I've been driving for less than 10 years, so you know I'm always right.	I'm an old timer on the road.....what I think rules.
15565	"thanks Obama" was always meant as a joke, these retards are serious.	Blaming video games is the 'thanks, Obama!' of outrage over entertainment mediums.
15566	Don't forget about how every one of them has fucked your mom.	It's also the most ignored rating system ever created. ^Source: ^I've ^been ^called ^a ^faggot ^countless ^times ^by ^12 ^year ^olds ^in ^CoD.
15567	master chief is superhuman so therefore nightwing can't win because he is human	Master Chief downvotes brigade is back! Been a while guys!
15568	let us consider both options...see what tents are available and then decide on the better option ?	Oof. You have two options: up the budget or up the weight you're willing to carry. The second isn't awful if you have two people and can split the weight, at least.
15569	It's not really *impossible*, but it is hard to comprehend how they could be that careless.	It's just impossible that during the last year nobody at mtgox just brought out the old calculator just to check the numbers. I'm honestly stunned! At my work the economics team breaths fire when the excel sheets doesn't adds up down on the dollar each month.
15570	Take your eyes off the road and look where they're pointing, duh.	my favorite done by the co-pilot is "go that way". how the hell am i supposed to know what that means?
15571	but I kept reading everywhere how much he sucked!	Mesut Ozil's world cup performance
15572	ESPECIALLY	Even Stranger Than Fiction?
15573	Never heard that one before.	Fyourfeelings.
15574	I bet all the TSM fans would enjoy that	Them being angry is apart of the fun though, if hotshot tweeted about tsm being trash after a loss id be pissed, but thats the point really. I wouldnt want it any other way
15575	Yeah, now we can get back to screenshots about how people had a close game with 0 deaths and whatnot.	yeah, the relief this change brings is rivaled only by the relief i get knowing that the reddit will get interesting again.
15576	But their religion (Christianity) is the right religion and Jews are hellbound...	I think the Jews would disagree with them. That's just my 2 cents though.
15577	Because hurr durr 9/11 was Bush's fault	In all fairness, why the fuck would you make a video game like that post 9/11. That's asking for a visit by homeland security.
15578	Finally a huge car accident from UK.	Audi gets cut up by an idiot in my hometown
15579	Piece in the crease	Gun in the buns.
15580	He's a villian, giving everyone autism and what not	Edward Jenner. Wiki sums him up pretty well: "He is often called "the father of immunology", and his work is said to have "saved more lives than the work of any other man"
15581	Their parents were probably raised in an abusive household as well so they're off the hook too.	I think being raised in an abusive household where they were taught to behave this way is punishment enough. I guess I'm the only person in the world who feels bad for kids who are subjected to that kind of abuse.
15582	It's really because they're all out protesting and being lazy rioting blacks, amirite?	I'm gonna assume you're not a troll and just answer the question. School was supposed to start last thursday. Its now been a week of unexpected no school. Like everyone I was expecting my kids to be in school so when I went shopping i didnt buy stuff for their lunch/ breakfast cuz my kids buy lunch and eat breakfast there most everyday. Cue no school and I had to make an unexpected trip to the store. I'm fortunate and could afford this. Now imagine you're living in poverty barely making ends meet. You budgeted this month expecting your kids to get free meals (breakfast and lunch) from school. And... suddenly that just goes away with no warning. Money doesn't just appear when you need it. Also no school means no child care. So now you have to stay home to take care of them. Or pay for more daycare. Again another unexpected expense. (Im a stay at home mom so no problem for me. But others are not so lucky) Add to that reduced hours if you're screwed enough to also be working where they're closing early so that their employees don't get trapped by rioters and you've got yourself a personal tornado of suck that will most likely take a year (if not more) to get out of. (I got in debt of about $300 once. Took me a year to pay off cuz stuff kept happening... ) So its not a question of " why won't they feed their kids?" Its "why CAN'T they feed their kids?"
15583	You are so idealist utopian.	they are the fucking same thing. It like, there is a law saying I cant offer a high-five, or a law where I cant revive a high-five Does not matter which, there are no fucking high-fives.
15584	Also, walls are coded as minions.	Inb4 "OMFG THAT SHOULD HAVE HIT" after the skillshot bounced off a wall. This is difficult as the walls in Summoners Rift aren't straight, as well camera angle would be a real issue....
15585	That doesn't sound psychopathic at all.	The squirrels at my uncle's cabin were reaching from a tree to the bird feeder and my uncle was pretty upset. Before leaving one weekend he started running electricity through the feeder so that when the squirrels completed the circuit with the ground the electricity would run through them and they'd die. The problem that arose was that every time a squirrel died the electricity was so strong that the circuit breaker would flip in his house, thus rending his squirrel killer ineffective. Well, he fixed that problem and when he came up a couple weekends later he estimates that every squirrel on the lake lay dead under the feeder (maybe 90-100 squirrels). It happened to be the same week that the whole extended family (including myself) came up for a family reunion. We had a nice little mass burial.
15586	So like Smite's Poseidon's Pool, but not DoT, and instead burst at the end.	I think that stuff will be draged slightly to the centre, too
15587	Yep, it's definitely the democrats holding back drug legalization.	Keep voting for them revolving door policy democrats and this is what happens.
15588	Actually an infinite amount of numbers have never been used :p	There are some numbers that have never been used. eg. 5.2197213812 probably has never been used until now.
15589	But if alcohol is involved you can't consent hence she is raping you	Because "taking home a hambeast" and rape are not connected.
15590	Westbrook is toxic to the team and impeding on their long term success.	15/10/7 for Russ so far yet someone somewhere will still find ways to hate on him
15591	I too am surprised that humanity isn't one giant hivemind.	I am glad that this situation has been resolved, but for all of the hate that the media has gotten for giving details of this situation out, people are sure happy and keen to find out as much information as possible now that he is arrested. Like people are showing up in the pouring rain at the RCMP buildings in Moncton to try and catch a glimpse of him. The CBC interviewer just said he "is jealous because he hasn't seen any of the footage yet". A bit ironic isn't it?
15592	Yeah, you complaining is definitely a quality post.	This sub is becoming awful. Pretty sure we have enough pics of dirty N64s, Dreamcasts and loose Pokemon carts to last eons. Though I do love the actual good posts when they appear, it's unfortunate how far the quality of this subreddit has fallen in the past couple years. For example, the #1 and #2 posts right now are great! Getting tipped in N64 games for a pizza delivery is interesting, getting a bunch of 3DO games and slightly uncommon CIB NES games for $10 is interesting, finding a loose Guardian Heroes for $2 is interesting. Common junk is not so interesting, regardless of the "deal" you got on it. I think that sort of stuff should be consolidated into a weekly sticky thread or something.
15593	brb checking yahoo for trends	Daily Thread (6/10/14)- Trendy Tuesday What do you think is trending this week? It could be a song, a book, or anything else, just let us now about it below.
15594	And yet he manages to score goals :,) **\#Legend**	There is reason. The two previous biting incidents are much discussed. So ignore those for a moment. You still have a player who has been constantly accused of cheating. His deliberate handball against Ghana. His deliberate handball against Mansfield. His constant diving. He is constantly shown to be a venal man who has little respect for the rules. Which is not to say there is anything inherently wrong with taking every advantage, but taking these liberties certainly can create an understandable animosity. Add to this, his history of being petulant on the field...and apparently petulant enough with teammates at Ajax to cause a physical altercation in the locker room. In the premier league, he is a player who remonstrates after every physical contact, takes any excuse to go down, makes every effort to get players carded and fool officials. He is loathed with good reason. Add three incidents of physical assault on the pitch to this, and one can see why some are saying there is no longer any place for him in the game. *word
15595	Well yeah - I mean it's going to take every waking hour to browse all those suitable vacancies!	I often felt like I wasn't meant to have a life on JSA. If you're poor you automatically forfeit traveling, alcohol, leisure and hobbies. If you're not sleeping you should be searching for work apparently.
15596	Ah yes, the little-known "from Australia" whore qualifier.	"You won't have sex with me, and the only other things you've mentioned are that you're from Australia and your name. You match all three criteria of a WHORE." I love it when they make absolutely zero sense.
15597	This happens because we allow people free speech and protest.. duh... we just need a supreme leader to keep things straight.	Seriously, it's 2014 and the world is somehow going backwards... how do we allow this to happen?
15598	I'm going with the dude sitting in his mom's basement eating cheetos...	Hmmmm...Internet guy or distinguished legal veteran and congressman...
15599	As if the admins will reveal the identities of those who pull their strings aka SRS/Jooz/Feminazis	It will be interesting to see what the official reason for this is.
15600	Yeah, that philosophy will work out great.	adapt or die.
15601	"Air vehicles weren't OP in BF2" Fuck off	1. subjective 2. air vehicles were never op in BF2 3. That was your fault. You can hear it launch with a good set of headphones 4. Kit unlocks bastardize the effectiveness and necessity of a class
15602	Or just add	Sorry, my sarcasm didn't come across (it never does, I should really just start writing in a more literal manner). I meant to imply that a website on which many users tend to vilify a subreddit dedicated to calling out overt sexism and racism clearly has a bit of an unfortunate bias.
15603	Jeez hurry up guys WW3 is imminent!	The Insanely Expensive F-35 Is Delayed Again, Now Because of Software
15604	Republicans and Democrats -- the 2 parties that *both* made the US like this with their wars, crimes and pro-corporate policies -- ought to be ashamed of themselves.	Overwhelming Evidence that Half of America is In or Near Poverty
15605	dude...its obviously because you can't like, trust the cops ya know, they are all pigs and evil	The fact that he got downvoted for saying "Maybe you should have let the cops handle it instead of beating him up" is just.. Disturbing
15606	How does the joint stay lit under water?	Finally a spot worthy of r/trees
15607	Of course that doesn't actually happen, just the animus makes it seem that way.	Yea non suspicious. Because when you see a guy walk up to someone, pat them on the back and they collapse you don't even question it.
15608	Male Privilege is not being able to tell if you're being rapey or naive!	To add to this, bear in mind, if we make the mistake of assuming you're trying to make subtle hints and are wrong we get labelled as creeps, overly forward, arrogant, etc, and we can never go back to where we began. But if a girl makes that mistake the guy was obviously a fool for not saying yes.
15609	I don't know what OP means, but when I saw "meme" I knew Reddit would eat it up; "Everyone who is more successful than me is like this guy, the system is rigged" It's amazing that all these internet kids have the ability and reasoning to envision the perfect societal and economic mode.	Ever notice how so many of the success hating and redneck homophobe hating memes are: "some anon 3rd party"
15610	Due to global warming	2014 Closing In On Coldest Start To The Year In US History
15611	Get that Wraith tank out of there!	My room will be completed on schedule.
15612	Learning tools of the trade definitely ruins creativity.	Reminds me of the super-genius in my music theory class who wanted to be a composer/music major but dropped out because he "didn't want to ruin his creativity by learning how to read music." Lol good luck.
15613	Thanks Obama.	Carter on target on family income. "Adjusted for inflation, the average Georgia family in effect makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago," Carter said.
15614	I agree, he shouldn't have celebrated that goal	No it fucking wasn't good to see. I said this elsewhere, but to me it is pathetic that a Manchester United side celebrated that much going up at home to the team bottom of the table. Shows how far we've fallen.
15615	This is 2014 man.	They were nothing for Bayern.
15616	They're just mentally disturbed kids.	YEAH THEY ARE NOT BLACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15617	I hope those suits come back for the new movie, they were bad ass.	ooh for nostalgia sake . . . . Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (Trailer) 1995
15618	They also have a blue flame... source: crossed the 8 volt and 4 volt rails.	Blown capacitors smell like popcorn. Source: blew up a lot of capacitors.
15619	Get it cut	Reddit, how do you fix your hair when it just doesn't want to be the way you want it to be? Need help/experience
15620	`NUMBNESS WILL SUBSIDE AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES.`	Fisto and The Terminator
15621	works great when it works, but expensive to fix because front bumper for washer fluid.	B-but muh German engineering.
15622	Yes please	Pacific Hidden Base anyone?
15623	But they match, and they're preeeeettttyy, surely that's gotta shave a few strokes, no?	I don't really get the logic behind buying entire club sets of one brand or one model. Surely those weren't all the best choices for your swing or game
15624	Vince Gilligan predictable?	Well just cause its predictable doesn't mean its a bad ending.
15625	This guy gets it	Then miss, kill two bystanders and charge the kid with murder for causing the whole thing?
15626	I used to take Beta alanine for rowing, it doesn't give you a rush.	Ha, no it is not. The NO Xplode tingle you are feeling is from the added Beta Alanine. I'm not positive on its purpose, but it does result in that rushed almost electric feeling.
15627	*tips fedora*	So you're calling be a white night, or in other worlds, a badass from medieval times whose prowess in combat was only matched by his chivalry? You know, chivalry? That code of conduct whereby men actually treat women with respect and defend them from misogynistic jerks like the comment above? The time when men did not feel they were obligated to leer at and make unsolicited comments towards women? The time when men put effort into wooing instead of forcing themselves onto women? The time when people would actually think before paying a woman a compliment instead of blurting out something perverted like "I want my cock in your ass"? Yeah, you know what? I'm okay with that...
15628	This is Tim cooks way of saying "up yours" after the whole U2 fiasco.	Apple not offering '12 Days of Gifts' promotion for first time in six years
15629	Beer #3 and #4 are agents of capitalist Migug dodug and never existed.	Beer #6 is the best. All the times we went they only had beers #1,2,5,6. The other three are less popular and generally not available :)
15630	Big booty burger	Big black burger
15631	So many don't seem to understand that huge breasts and nice breasts aren't the same thing.	It seems like every post where a fat activist describes their body they have to mention their amazing *huge breasts* like we're supposed to be impressed.
15632	but how am I gonna make money like that pimp daddy :(	You shut your whore mouth
15633	prices will come down over time as more competition enters the market, legally.	Because the guy that comes by my house is friendly, has good stuff, and doesn't awkwardly hang around or anything? It's no worse than ordering a pizza. Oh, and we're talking like $80-100 for a half, so it's a damn big difference. $50 an eighth is highway robbery.
15634	A similar error message came up several times just now, running it through a Javascript validator...I have no idea what that means or how to resolve it though...	bootstrapvalidator: unexpected end of input
15635	That knitting circle are a just a bunch of misandrist shitladies!	Right. There are plenty of hobbies and careers out there that are primarily dominated by one sex. This alone doesn't make those things misogynistic or misandristic, it just shows a difference in interests.
15636	Men can't be raped silly.	I'm a gay man. If we're both drunk and we both regretted it afterward, who got raped? LOL This is remarkable trash.
15637	Hey, my mother went to Iowa buddy.	You're comparing a rivalry between 2 teams that haven't been out of the top 25 in 40-50 weeks and both teams having won at least 10 games each of the past 3 years with a rivalry between 2 teams that have combined for 1 ten win season since 2005. It's not the same.
15638	So, here's the deal, Join a college, harass students on your will, molest 'em or "whatever" &amp; then get expelled... So being a college student gives you immunity from the law of the country, sweet...	3 students of Visva-Bharati expelled for stripping, molesting a junior student
15639	pretty certain we didn't have a spare, and it was just as easy and informative to rewire the plug - it's hardly difficult	The Playstation used a normal two-prong power cord. Wouldn't it have been easier to just take another one from an unused device/junk drawer?
15640	That Sharpie tat is surely going to cause some regret for the next few days for sure!	This is what regret looks like.
15641	Nice tips but if the situation is one of shooting through a narrow line of sight don't try to shoot a couple of centimeters away from my head.	Quick tips to lower team killing Tip #1: If you see a couple of fellow insurgency player in prone/crouch position and waiting for the enemy to show face... ...**Stand** behind them. That way you won't shoot their head's off in the process. :) Happened to me several times last night, head capped or shot in the legs etc Easily prevented! Tip #2 Be careful with your **burst firing** ! If you are moving up in some kind of formation, but there is some likelihood that people will cross over, **single fire** is more effective. It also helps preserve your ammo as you won't have 4+ dudes wasting multiple rounds for a single target!
15642	Creepy and manipulative in one short sentence!	A friend told me that she once was told " I think we met in the pre-existence. "
15643	Glad to hear it.	thanks for that never should found it. its in the account management and worked fine. finally^^
15644	Yep, that's the "smart move" I talked about.	I think they separated the alphabets so that you could change case by flipping one bit.
15645	I think it's more Marc Trestman pulling a fast one on literally everyone by making McCown look good in his system.	Yeah, this is just further proof that Josh McCown pulled a fast one on the Bucs front office. There's no way he should be a starting NFL QB.
15646	video link plz	RIP Robin Williams
15647	Yeah I can definitely see the allure in that kind of micro, especially since it is both functional and attainable (but still be difficult)	The lack of difference in control at top level protoss. Most of their units are too automated. The amount of automation and lack of excitement in big battles seems to be the main problem I think... They fixed a lot of things over the years, but they still need to create more oppertunity for micro for all races. You watch zergs just spread their units as they run toward a terran's army or set up a flank, mean while you see this godly control of marine from top lvl terrans. Zerg could do crazy micro too, but they can get by half assing it. Stephano in his prime barely even practiced. He played, but not nearly as much as his counter parts.
15648	Hoax itu mah... momod tolong ti banned dong orangnya nyebarin hoax...	ah hoax itu mah.
15649	I've never seen the Big Lebowski.	I saw The Big Lebowski too. Why don't you actually think about it instead of just firin your laser
15650	coastguard?	which branch doesn't.

15652	Is this even legal?	Attn my southie friends: Missionaries are out in full force in your area!
15653	Are we talking a Panton print, reproduction, or original?	I really liked this artwork at the thrift store and bought it for almost nothing. After some research, I think it might be a Verner Panton piece.
15654	I blame porn overdose.	I don't understand this. I have some male acquaintances that aren't exactly a catch themselves but expect any future girlfriend to be model quality hot, addicted to sex, super sweet, and have a high paying job. These are unattractive, unsuccessful, kinda shitty personality men. Then they go after these women and bitch about being shot down or friend zoned. OR if they somehow trick these women into dating them, they treat them like crap, like objects to do whatever they please, and wonder why they leave. I don't even understand.
15655	There's no way that's pre WWI, it's in colour!	Smoking out of a pre WWI pipe handed down through the generations.
15656	Came here looking for this quote	Well stay here and rot, you stuck up bitch.
15657	Those weren't 12 to 6 though, but they were to the back of the head.	Yeah, like the hands of a clock. It was banned to prevent exactly that from happening, fuckin brutal.
15658	I dont think its a bug, im pretty sure its intended	They can work on bosses/purples but only if they can be knocked back by something. Cyclone Strike is actually bugged and will pull yellows/purples if you hit them with an exactly max range pull. Also, LTK: Sweeping Armada does work on yellows/purples but it's annoying as fuck. You basically have to just kick them into a wall over and over.
15659	Cocky boys that make more money than you + better at the game ;)	So happy to see Soaz and Wickd out of worlds &lt;3
15660	Their reasoning for removing "back" as an option was to reinforce Android design guidelines by forcing you to use the back button.	Right? Why would they ever remove that?
15661	He is just mindlessly repeating what other intellectually stunted people have told him.	Heard my friend say this recently... "First of all there's no such thing as an atheist. 'Atheists' have to first acknowledge that there is a god in order to deny him." I laughed then realized he was serious...
15662	I know, but the Headline gave me hopes for a GC Controller which you could hook up to the wii mote, or maybe even a Pro Controller Version for Wii U.	The caption on said picture says that it was made for the Wii, I'd assume that was designed for traditional fighting games.
15663	yeah, all 5 points of it... smh.	People take karma more seriously than you think.
15664	depressed or compressed?	there was a guy in Toronto about 20 years ago that did something a lot like that except the window was 15 floors up and he ended up very depressed
15665	The Breyer's "blasts" are all terrible.	I had a birthday cake flavor and samoas flavored. Both sucked.
15666	Do you have any idea how many checks are mailed now?	If you do away with the massive number of government checks that would have to be mailed out, I'd be all for it.
15667	I'm not sure if that answers his question.	Well I am drinking whiskey at 7 am.
15668	Yeah but they still made a video for every song.	Half of those were super lazy though. And I am the biggest DG stan you will ever meet.
15669	The solution to all these complaints about indefinite detention at Gitmo is clearly to make it so nobody knows what is going on at Gitmo.	The one other thing to note is that the removal criteria was in place before the messaging started, and there were no complaints until there was messaging.
15670	Ugh... those toolbars	How I feel about any freeware
15671	Why is it okay for police officers to pepper spray non-violent people on the street?	That is true. As a criminal justice major in the US it is supposed to go the order of officer presence, verbal commands, soft hands techniques like oc spray wrist locks and in some cases tazers, followed by hard hand techniques such as using a baton in non vital areas or takedowns, followed by lethal force with a gun or striking vital areas with a baton such as the head or neck
15672	No, they added skins and instantly game performance dropped down.	CS:GO added particle effects and hats? News to me.
15673	I know your anger...	The cult of personality.
15674	Yes, try these on and let's load up 4 plates for you to deadlift.	I'm on the smaller side, but have been powerlifting for quite some time. Some girl at my gym asked me if it's because of my shoes that I can handle so much weight. Mind you I'm wearing inov-8 bare, no support whatsoever. Why can't I just be a strong female?
15675	No, its the plot from How I Met Your Mother.	Isn't that the plot of Superman 3?
15676	can't tell if serious or	OP please make a video of you playing it with someone
15677	one of my only memories from kindergarten was making a girl laugh so much nacho cheese oozes out of her nose.	Clicked on one of the related videos and watched a puppy shit nacho cheese. Then another dog licked it up.
15678	Yep =)	holland?
15679	Well, its not like furries are actual people.	What if they're a furry? Weren't furries around first?
15680	Yeah, but that makes too much sense.	Totally agree, although I also agree with the folks that say it is a freak show. There has to be some sort of show besides "hey...that lady has two heads. nice. let's go home"
15681	If I could understand how he could be confused by 3 sentences and pictures I'd have lots of my questions answered about him.	Because "add 1 cup milk, 1/2 tbsp butter" is *way* too complicated.

15690	Is the kernel the reason why we don't see many games on Linux, though?	well hopefully valve will help kickstart the kernel devs into making Linux a viable platform for games
15691	No, it's a false fact...	Is this a true fact?

15701	The others skins say "Bathe in the glow" at the same volume, you only realized the Ramerica one because of that luscious voice.	This may be just for me, but RaMerica says "Come get some!" when he uses his heal, so I know that I can heal.
15702	Who knows why the New London Police Department didnt want the *40 year old police trainee*?	It is hogwash. One department tried it a decade ago and people think every department in the US does it.
15703	Damn, too bad he didnt know he could read the script before taking the part.	TIL that Alec Guinness, the actor who played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy, hated the film and described it as "fairy tale rubbish" and persuaded George Lucas to kill off Obi-Wan because he "couldn't go on speaking those bloody awful, banal lines" and he "had enough of the mumbo jumbo".

15707	I'm really looking forward to "literally autistic" in twitch chat now	VP.NS flames EG and C9 tweeting that rejecting to play is autism
15708	The 3 I've gotten on WonderTrade beg to differ.	I thought the one in Kalos was the same of Kanto. I'm pretty sure game canon says there's only one Mewtwo.
15709	I like to be called PERFECT because anything less is an insult to my amazing glory.	Do you prefer to be called cute or hot? I've been thinking recently about it and came to the coclusion that I actually prefer being called cute for this reason "As a teenager I personally love being called cute, but I do get the occasional handsome and hot. Cute just seems more humanizing, whereas hot is more sexual, I mean I'm fine with hot and if anybody where to call me it I would be just as appreciative but generally the people who call me cute want to chat longer instead of trying to be sexual with me straight away. In my experience anyway." So, what do you prefer to be called and why?
15710	Need a UN Peace Keeping troops to maintain the "peace" with Palestinians in Gaza	75 UN troops flee across Golan border into Israel to escape Syrian rebels
15711	Thanks for asking permission to repost my shit!	I Fixed a GTA Style PKA Wallpaper!
15712	I guess that's true :\ I hope I won't change when I get a job...	Without knowing you guys personally, all I can say is some people are just like that. Some people are not great at the work it takes to maintain a friendship. I'm guilty of it. It doesn't mean they don't like you.
15713	I guess that is a matter of opinion though	so many awful bands
15714	Most countries binge drink, especially european ones.	The whole point of having lighter beers like the ones we have in america is because Americans like to binge drink. We have good craft beers in america, but good luck having much fun at a party when your bloated and full.
15715	being the best team in the worst division in the NL is not exactly something to be excited about right now.	Man.. you are really pessimistic about our situation. Only in Atlanta can a team be on top of their division and still get shit on.

15721	Lower tier = better camo obv	The JP2 has less camo than the Jagdtiger. Not sure why people still don't understand this - the JT has plenty of camo.
15722	It's because your toilets flush counterclockwise because you're in southern hemisphere	Australia. We flush our toilet paper.
15723	But Git is better, and smart people use Git, and centralization is a terrible idea that should have never been invented, and only an idiot would choose SVN over Git, and mah sugahs are dropping (oh wait, wrong subreddit)!	If you want to preserve a linear history of commits using rebase, you probably should just be using SVN. Most issues with people have with git is them trying to use it like SVN.
15724	Just remember, everyone... GET A JOB.	The drug-free poster in my little brothers high school basically just serves as a list of things that inevitably get better AFTER you get high
15725	Now this is a person you can trust when you ask him during a match to uninstall Dota.	So I decided to uninstall all the steam games that I didn't play anymore, this was the result when I lined them all up... When was the last time you had a clear out?
15726	S1337 makes for a slippery slope.	"S1337 would make it a crime, punishable by imprisonment, to simply photograph or videotape abusive, unsanitary or otherwise unethical activity on a farm. Even employees and journalists who take photos or video to document misconduct on farms could face criminal prosecution."
15727	And TIL all bodybuilders are actually really weak, they just look big.	TIL: a bunch of guys at their computers in sweatpants covered in cheeto dust are arm wrestling technique experts.
15728	Jesus in all my anagramming I didn't figure that out.	And the phrase "April Fool".
15729	That was because the rubberbanding and how it was map specific was OUR fault!	It took them 6 months to officially say something about it (yesterday) so I doubt the fix will come so soon
15730	You are a bad person, how dare you enjoy something that you like.	I genuinely enjoyed Movie 43 and it makes me feel like a bad person.
15731	Blatant racism...great.	I think in a lot of cases they haven't, there are a lot of cases of people not putting discs back into cases or just opening he machines altogether and emptying out all the-- Oh, *RAC*coon problem...
15732	Maybe there is a reason why Poland cannot into space	Polish church wants to tax atheists because they "live off of negating church and god". Tax money, of course, would all go to the church...

15734	That would just be perfect...	If he somehow ends up a Cowboy he'll be the second coming of Hitler.
15735	You can always go to the library	Job hunting/applying would be next to impossible in the case of most professions. In healthcare, for instance, you CANNOT apply on paper, and job listings are exclusively online.
15736	Damn budget cuts.	Flag on top of Thorvaldson is halfway loose
15737	That works for me!	Huh, didn't realize that we don't have class. If you'd like to see them sooner, Wednesday at the same time would work as well.
15738	And there are never pileups up north on the freeways.. I mean, it's not like I-94 in Indiana just had a massive pileup on it a few days ago... and there are never lots of accidents the first few times it snows up north either because people never forget what it's like to drive in snow and icy conditions	Lol, you act like people in the north never get wet snow.
15739	HAHAHAHAHAHA	Shit my husband says
15740	Yeah, GTA V is the only console game to have aim assist	No it doesn't. This isn't GTA V.
15741	He's still not good, just really fast....	"QBs have thrown on Earl Thomas 16 times -- he's broken up six passes and picked off four."
15742	Hey, he might be the oldest ride, but he still has the longest line.	Ric Flair. I'm not talking 70's/80's "limousine ridin', jet flyin'" Flair, I'm talking 90's on. I feel like they only kept him around because of who he was a decade or two earlier, but every time I talked to my friends about it, they'd say something like "oh you're crazy, he's still putting on great matches."
15743	See, there's this amazing thing called Google, you should try it sometime	what does my name mean? my name is Yousuf
15744	I'm 99% sure Bruce Willis was replaced with a look alike, much like the whole Paul McCartney situation.	That Bruce Willis was dead the whole time in Sixth Sense.
15745	Yeah, witness #40 sure gave some overwhelming testimony clearing Officer Wilson!	There was never a trial because the evidence was so overwhelming it wasn't needed.
15746	You mean he's not already?	So if he drew a picture of obama, Obama would look like some mutated freak?
15747	Unjust laws need to be broken.	For some reason, people think that if they don't want something to be illegal, it's a terrible cruel thing if someone gets arrested for it.
15748	Unless your name is Abraham.	Most of the time God tells someone to do something awful, we go with, "bat shit crazy."
15749	Hey that's not very nice!	*retard
15750	Didn't end too well for them...	I think most of the Romans are too dead to be survayed tho
15751	That's worked so well for some of the other Catholic teachings like birth control.	I love what I've seen of this guy so far. But "urge?" He's the supreme pontiff; can he not just ORDER all Catholics to take action?
15752	ITT we find out that *pottersquash* had his gf stolen by Kirk Cousins.	Oddly specific there bro
15753	It's uncommon i promise :)	if it were uncommon in any way, it would be a commodity for the same reason it is in our world: it's shiny. And pretty. And rare. Even if it were only somewhat uncommon, you could use it in place of copper for coins. If it were more common, imagine the way we use iron in our society today. It's a softer metal, yes, but if it's easy to mine, you'd probably see it used in everything from weapons and armor to silverware. Plus, if it were cheap and looked nice, you'd see it in a lot of villages as decoration - fountains, windowframes, sidewalk trim, etc.
15754	That I'm addicted to coffee	What does your username say about you?
15755	I actually find them to be more annoying, because they're being negative.	Its that time iPhone time of year.
15756	You've summed it up more beautifully than I could.	You would think so but as someone who has been sucked into this many times as a dev it is a pain. The expectation of freebees, a misunderstanding of how difficult it might actually be to fulfill their request, etc. There is no such thing as a little side job most of the time ether. This is at least my experience, I will help with hardware and Windows related issue sbut have a hard line at custom software. This story makes me shudder because of the words " less 'Excel' in orientation". As a dev in the financial industry these words make me cry.
15757	Stop lighted roundabouts are a symptom of an underlying disease endemic to all UK councils that I like to call "control-freakery".	Cannot stand them. It's like the council said "We're putting a roundabout in place as it's the best method of reducing congestion and increasing traffic flow", then a short while later putting in lights is like them saying "The people in charge of the decision to install the roundabout had spent little to no time driving in that area and as such were not the right persons to make the decision. Therefore, traffic lights again". Winds me up far more than it should.
15758	Points in dm are meaningless bro.	Extremely important change request: Remove the Zeus from the Deathmatch Bonus weapons. Because wtf. I've never seen that weapon get a kill. And if you're gonna keep it make it worth like 500 bazillion points.
15759	Both of them are.	just call him a poolie
15760	It is and it isn't	This is still a circlejerk, right? I noticed the sidebar says this isn't a circlejerk, I'm a little confused. Wasn't this subreddit made specifically to be a circlejerk? When I discovered it a few months ago it was entirely memes about filthy console peasants and jokes comparing consoles to potatoes and such.
15761	This is just evidence that global warming is a farce made up by the elite leftist conspiracy of scientists and hippies	For the first time in ~10 years, it's snowing in Southern California. People are waking their kids up at 2am so they can see snow for the first time.
15762	Look who's persecuting the christians.	Arizona politician mistakes 'Y' campers for migrant children
15763	Obviously not for dominos who will fire you for having a weapon at work, let alone using one.	You care to take part in a reenactment and explain to me why you think being able to speak has fuck all to do with time to draw a gun and fire on multiple attackers beating you with a bat from behind? Or are you just one of those dickshits that thinks he knows what he'd do if he got stuck in a bad situation? You ever been jumped from behind? Ever been robbed? Ever been to the shady side of town? The projects? New Orleans? Have you ever even delivered pizza?
15764	You did good but if you see him again simply take a picture Nd make him aware of you doing so, this will work for any situation like this, also if the worse ends up happening you have a picture of said douche to give the cops.	My dog didn't like him There was a hard knocking on my apartment door and my dog went nuts. Its not uncommon for my dog to do so but once she realizes who it is she stops. I got up from the couch and peered through the peep hole. From what I could tell, he was a tall man wearing a green jumper and baseball hat. The uniform was similar to the bug exterminator, my apartment complex empolys every month. It was about that time of the month for them to come by. So I open the door just a crack and tried to hold back my barking dog with my foot. "Hello? Can I help you?" "Good morning, sir," the man said with a smile" my name is Mike and I am here today to test an amazing new carpet cleaning product!" Then held out a large canister, oddly covering up with his hands any logo. But I could tell by canister it was a normal Lysol cannister. "Sir," I said cuting him off from the rest of his speach " there is no soliciting in this complex. I am not interested.Have good day " As I shut the door, he stuck his foot in the door frame. This time my dog is snarling and growlibg baring her teeth.(something she never does ) I firmly said " I said no and if you dont leave immediately I will call the cops." I then shoved the door closed and dead bolted the door. It took my dog serveral minutes for her to calm down but when she finally did I took her outside. As I walked her to up to her "pee spot", I saw the man again. This time he was going up to childern playing and asking them where they lived abd if their parents were. My dog saw him and again went completely nuts, barking, growling bearing teeth. "Sir, you need to leave right now!" "Hey!" The man said angrily" I trying to earn a living! " He started to approach me in aggressive manner. Pointing his finger at me, shouting and accusing me of preventing him from doing his job. This whole time my dog was getting more and more irritated . I pulled out my phone and told him I was calling the cops. "Do it!" He screamed walking right in front me. That is when my dog bit his ankle farily hard. He jumped and ran to his truck. He opened the door and screamed" Get your fucking dog away from me. You'll be hearing from the cops about this assault. " ok I will wait!" Cops never came. This guy was a serious creeper maybe casing places to steal from or worse . I am glad my dog bit him .
15765	References to Kids in the Hall or Bruce Springsteen always get my upvote.	What do you ALWAYS upvote? I always upvote references to Daria and Clueless, people who about they are wrong but are getting downvoted anyways, and the people who answer my questions!
15766	He wanted to take over her Navel Base	Did you talk about annexing her while giving her a knowing glance?
15767	I don't know man, I haven't watched him enough but going from being a wing to be a (somewhat) play caller that late in your career and in a new league would be hard.	Considering he is 6'5" i think he can pass for sg or pg. i know he has high bbiq and kobe will play a lot of min so that is why i think maybe we can sign him as a pg
15768	Take note, Paul George.	Roy "The Virgin" Hibbert is saving himself for Miami.
15769	It says "Are you sure" because it's still a Microsoft product.	What happens if you are in party chat and somebody says "Xbox OFF"?
15770	Siglite Night Sights	Your title says pretty much nothing, since I came in thinking you were asking about stocks. Yes the SRT is worth it. If by "siglites" you mean flashlights, I would buy a Streamlight or Surefire instead.
15771	You can't be serious, and if you are then you are lacking knowledge in how the internet works	Why should Comcast sit by and let Netflix decrease their profitability? Why shouldn't Netflix bear the burden of decreased profitability? Because their PR machine has convinces you they are good while Comcast is evil? Quite laughable indeed.

15776	Oh look, it thinks it's human.	The force is strong with this one.
15777	but he complimented your smile so by human nature you should want to fuck him immediately no?	I missed out on this "nice guy." He deleted his profile shortly after.
15778	I'm sure they very carefully measure out exactly how much drugs they have on them at any given time and that there's no cop that'd bust them anyway, right?	According to the OP there, they live in a country where its just a misdemeanor for the amounts they are carrying at worst.
15779	Because giving women high paying, high powered, cushy jobs at the socio-economic right of the bell curve is just giving women their rightful places alongside men...but...making women carry their own weight in cleaning half the sewers, extracting and refining half the resources, performing half the manufacturing, constructing half the buildings, laying half the infrastructure and hauling half the fucking trash is misogyny, SHITLORD!	why nobody proposes gender quotas for physically heavy work? I don't understand the whole argument that women can't do physically demanding work traditionally reserved to men. I would say they can do it, maybe not all of it but a good portion. my great-grandmothers and all my female ancestors before them used to do paesant work like making hay, bundle it up on their back and trasporting it, chopping woods, cropping, watering the vineyard with a water container that weighted like 50 lbs full to carry on their shoulders etc. not as much as my male ancestors but still enough hard labor to probably exhaust a lot of modern day men. they became used to it after years of practice because they didn't have the luxury to do anything different. today we have the technological know how to apply the lever principle and implement servomechanisms and various machineries to help ease the burden of physical labor in many instances compared to the past. I believe this reluctancy to include women in heavy works comes from a more or less unconscious belief that women's life is more valuable than ours because they are child bearers and they shouldn't waste themselves doing too much physical or hazardous work. whenever someone mentions gender quotas is always about leadership positions or company boards and no mention of steel mills or constructions. :-(

15785	All while you sit around completely helplessly because of tristana's passive that makes it so you can't move or use any abilities, dumb champ please nerf.	Still bullshit when trist can auto-ult-auto and end up dishing out potentially 1500 damage nearly instantly (600 from both crits and 300 from ult, mixed damage) if both autos crit at 30 minutes into the game. And if you're NOT dead after that, she can either jump towards you to finish you off (Jumping right out after, because free resets), kite you, or if you're fed enough to where she can't fight you, she's now at an incredibly safe distance to run away.
15786	Yeah, sure it looks cool, but wouldn't you rather carry around a piece of trash?	Could this was a scrap peace of wood, own a wood burning kit, sander and stain. All it took was work.

They said there was blood all over and the dog's nails were ripped off from him trying to scratch his way out. The kid laughed when he found out. I cried when I heard about it.

In WvW you can also look for the one with consumables (food &amp; oil) and/or the bloodlust buff.
15810	Will you quit nit picking, like omg	Of course you're right. They're trying to trick people into thinking it's real. I don't like when people try to trick me so I don't think it's as funny.
15811	Nah any league average players could've done what Kruger and Frolik did	Him and Kruger on the PK were amazing
15812	all of the characters from dragon ball z	The art of getting shit done. Who's your favourite character who always has a penchant for getting results? Kamina, Shiroe, Lelouch, Sora, Tatsuya...all characters who are exceptional at actually getting results. There's very little tip toeing around a problem and most of things hit things head on. Who's your favourite? Be it by strength of will or cunning intelligence.

15814	But iOS 7 is perfect!	Holy crap! Someone else has this issue. I'm not the only one. Yes, I have iPhone 5s on 7.1.2 with boosted animations and i still get the lag. Its so frustrating. I made two separate posts about this, but as I can see, you have haters too. If you cant help, why be snobby? Although, wish I could help, but for now I'm just dealing with it.
15815	Just be happy.	Gather up some courage, money and just do something weird. Anything which you would normally wouldn't do, like go on a road trip or go to clubs and party all night, or just go to a lively restaurant and eat food there. Anything which could jump start your life, you will eventually feel better!

15820	Oh sorry	This poor guy THINKS they have a chance, which is sad enough in itself.

15823	Yeah I hate paying 60 dollars to play 300+ hours of just multi-player like BF4 or COD.	good. I hope its not Titanfall 2 right away. Or if it is, then i hope we get a complete game for $60 and not just the multiplayer mode of a shooter
15824	Cooked anything makes it easier for the nutrients to be absorbed in the body, so whatever you 'lose', you more than make up for by cooking it.	How much nutrients do quail eggs loose after cooking? Me and my girlfriend wond if it is worthy to pay the extra money for quail eggs if we cook them. What do you think? Also can you point us to a empirical based article that assess this issue? Thank you!
15825	We can fix that.	B..But i'm Danish
15826	You belong in diamond when you get to diamond.	Ive been gettin insanely unlucky in soloQ lately thats why i am only plat IV, that being said im pretty sure i have the potential to be at least diamond, thats kind of what i mean with elo isnnot that important cause it doesnt always show the actual skill of the player.

15830	Because those duck dynasty guys sure have all that public support.	What if I'm in a duck dynasty type situation where the local population rallies around it? Should we let the local community enforce this type of segregation and be fine with it?

15834	It's a complete bargain!	The peasants are wising up!
15835	Fucking terrorist.	Here's the funny thing: if I have to get a background check to buy powder and primers, its going to make that more expensive and inconvenient. That means I'm going to want to do it less often, which means I'm going to buy more every time I do it, which means I am going to have a bigger "stockpile" of explosives in my house than I would if I could just take a 15 minute drive and buy a 1 pound jug and a box of primers when I need them. (So I'm probably a terrorist.)
15836	Who doesn't want a more just world where players can bite whoever they want to, it's just not fair!	Diego Lugano on Suarez ban: "Outraged, helpless; I think that's how we all feel. We would all like a more just world, but that world simply doesn't exist."

15842	For sure, hiring an external firm to assess and improve team relationships, or holding mandatory annual *sensitivity training* are really great ways to support your studio.	Also have to give credit to Take Two/2k Games. Every story I've read about them casts them in a very positive light. They give a lot of freedom to studios to make their games and offer a lot of support to meet that goal.
15843	so bulk at 250 over tdee and dont get fat wow that was hard	Do you not have an accurate idea of gaining muscle lol? If you gain one pound a week, around half of that is going to be fat. If you want to gain a large amount of muscle over a long period of time (which is more productive than short bulks), then you will gain a significant amount of fat. I will probably choose to not continue this conversation, as it is basically me responding to **your** **opinion** with evidence that points otherwise. No point in me trying to change your opinion, when most others will understand this concept.

"Can you keep a secret? I'm trying to organize a prison break. I'm looking for, like, an accomplice. We have to first get out of this bar, then the hotel, then the city, and then the country. Are you in or you out?" - Bob Harris in the Lost In Translation trailer.

15890	In the off-season MotoGP Riders often do Motocross... so... theres that.	Thoughts on dirt bikes Just a disclaimer i do not own or have ever ridden a street motorcycle. I have however owned 5 or so dirtbikes so far in my life and do have an interest for all things 2 wheels. One of the guys i go dirtbiking with who does ride streetbikes brought up an interesting thought about motorcycles, what he said is that anyone who wants a motorcycle should own a dirtbike first. Now i know some of you probably are not interested in gearing up for a day at a motocross track or driving hours to put around a forest trail but there are many benefits of riding an offroad bike before an on road bike. The first obviously is that you can learn without the threat of cars or other motorists and actually get comfortable with the controls and handling at your own pace. Another is you can learn basic maintenance more easily on a dirtbike since many times they are much simpler and have far less components that streetbikes, and more importantly they require maintenance more often. A big factor as well is that you can learn how the bike will react at its limit more easily and safely than on a streetbike and can therefore potentially become a better rider in emergency situations. Personally though for me my favorite part about riding a dirtbike is that i can drive as fast and aggressively as i want without endangering others which it seems is a big problem around certain motorcycle riders. Now obviously they are not all good. For one they are very expensive for something i cant even drive to work, they require much more maintenance (which may not be a bad thing for eager learners), and they are not very forgiving in challenging terrain. Thoughts?? Also, i would like to note that i am interested in eventually getting a road bike. But at the present time it is too expensive and too impractical for me.

15900	Maybe it is stress from worrying about taking care of the new kitten?	I don't know if this is a Glitch This is very minor and I am not good at writing, but here it goes: I just brought home a kitten the day before yesterday, ever since then minor little 'glitches' have been happening, I cannot remember the ones before the one I just experienced minutes ago, here, sitting at my desk, but here's my experience. -I am sitting on my desk, and my kitten is sleeping at the end of it, so I went to grab my mouse for the computer which is within a few inches of my hand, but then for a split second, my hand pets my cat, when my cat wasn't even within arms reach. -By the way, ever since I got the little guy, I have been having really weird dreams, for example: On the first day I got the kitten, I took a nap, and I dreamt that my father stormed into my room and was going to shoot me and kill me, but instead of being scared, I said that I wanted to die anyways, and I showed him where to shoot me. -I also had another dream where I got hit by a train -I have had other dreams, but I can't remember any of the others So if you guys have any advice, thoughts, etc, it would be appreciated

15917	Yeah, Carcillo's boarding calls where he gimps himself in the process are way worse than career ending headhunter hits.	I'm not surprised to see Dan Carcillo over Matt Cooke. Cooke at least has some talent and value as a hockey player, whereas Carcillo is just a gigantic pile of shit that needs to kindly go fuck himself forever.
15918	No, nobody has ever thought that before.	Does anybody think each team should start to get a 4th ban? I mean, we still are running off the 3 we had since before there was even 100 champions. It would really change things if 8 instead of 6 total champions were banned during champ select. Opinions?
15919	Just to strengthen your argument, the latest USA Today/Gallup poll has Santorum beating Obama 49-46 nationally.	I don't agree with this in the slightest. The goal isn't to make GOPs look ridiculous. They are doing just fine on their own. Isn't the goal to put the two best possible candidates forward who are most committed towards bettering the country? Yeah there is no way Santorum could be elected -- unless gas prices continue to rise and idiots think that is Obama's fault, or there is more unrest in the middle east and Santorum uses it to his advantage. Never underestimate America's ability to go full-retard. Santorum was in the race before this operation. That is troubling enough. Do whatever it takes to fucking keep Santorum out. Yeah, it would be funny if Santorum got nominated and then got slaughtered. But you guys haven't really thought this one through -- if something happens and this fucking tyrant (I am NOT exaggerating) is in office - **we can only blame ourselves because we will have voted for him**
15920	Came here to say this.	this
15921	Bullshit, we all live in America!	I'm English and don't live in America. So no, I never voted for Obama.
15922	Yeah because releasing information to the public about current or recent affairs as well as developing technology totally doesn't compromise our safety and security.	Hmmm....
15923	That sounds loads easier than just changing the disc	I would assume the same way steam handles games, since they are tied to the account, I would hope that you could uninstall it, and reinstall later if you wanted.

15929	Yes, just roll over and be violated.	Exactly. He was going out of his way to be rude, hostile and condescending. Stop being a dick and maybe this gets resolved a lot quicker. You can have a disagreement without calling the police pigs while demanding that they call you "sir."
15930	Yea, but he looks like a hipster so he must get laughed at.	Tell you what, this is actually pretty cool. When I saw OP's picture, I didn't know what to think at first, the attire was...weird at least, and who would carry a typewriter around? But now that I know the guy is out there, writing short stories, I actually like the idea. I don't even care if he does it for money or because he likes what he does, this guy gets to meet new people all the time and entertains them, either by making them ponder his activities, or by providing them with a story. There are far worse ways to spent your time if you ask me.
15931	You didnt build that!	This will do nothing but cost jobs. Let me explain: I am a business owner in the State of oregon. When the vote came up to increase the minimum wage (again) I explained to my employees (1/3 of which are minimum wage manual laborers who work part time) that if the minimum wage increase passed on election day, I would be forced as an employer to do one of several things: Because the cost of labor is added into the price of my products, the price of the products would have to go up. This would end up costing the consumer more, effectively negating any minimum wage increase that they received. (this goes for ALL products and services) OR, I could put a halt on expanding my operations, thereby keeping the unemployment rate stagnant in my State. OR, I could reduce hours and benefits, simply in order to keep operating costs the same as they were prior to the minimum wage increase. Finally, I could leave wages and benefits the same, but I would need to reduce the workforce to an amount that would keep operating costs the same as they were prior to the increase. A minimum wage job isn't mean't for a family man to feed a family of four on. It's meant for part timers who want an extra job, students who are working through college, etc. I simply cannot justify paying someone who punches a button every ten seconds, $10 per hour. If you want to make more money than minimum wage pays, learn a skill and get a better paying job. Or, simply do what I did: Create your own job by finding a need and filling it.
15932	Yes, that would certainly lead to a balanced and reasonable conclusion to the study.	Easiest way to do it is to pay other feminists to a few bucks each to play the games and write a synopsis with some kind of grading matrix. Then use that data to start doing videos.
15933	Well at least his meat wouldn't be wasted!	op you are one sic fuck and i hope you are eaten by wolves
15934	You'll want a full sized 1911, I'd suggest Ed Brown, and in a nice OWB retention holster to carry condition 1.	Concealed carry recommendations (firearm and method of carry) for petite 5'2" 120lb female, please. I'm 5'2" tall and 120 lbs, so I'm quite small. I've been looking for a concealed carry weapon, but am disheartened because everyone I talk to looks me up and down and says "don't bother" because anything that I can conceal on my body is crap to shoot or anything worth carrying can't be concealed. The most common recommendation I get is "buy pepper spray". That's fine advice, but not the solution I want. Do you have any advice or suggestions?
15935	Oh sure, complain that their 500 year future tech is too modern, then complain they shouldn't be able to build mechs.	I thought the Mantis should of been a promethean vehicle. Then everyone would be happy that there was a new type of vehicle, and nobody would be complaining about the practicalities of the UNSC manufacturing a Mech.
15936	My internet points!	A subreddit whose only purpose is to downvote brigade on reddit does not have the right to exist.
15937	ME TOO HOLY SHIT	Today's game was my first at the Camp Nou, no words can explain what a wonderfull time I had. I'll be back!
15938	Obviously you only wanted to stay with your dad because he would let you smoke crack and play violent video games.	I believe it is sixteen where I live as well. My parents divorced when I was twelve and I said I wanted to stay with my dad, but was forced to live with my mom.
15939	They have cliffs they can throw the inferior child off of.	Poor bastard if born a boy then.
15940	Yeah, this'll end well.	French President considering homework ban because it favors wealthy
15941	pretty great, seems super popular in the forest!	What do you guys think of my new pvp build?
15942	Double the freshness!	Double the fun!
15943	Yes, because you *clearly* need guns to solve that issue.	What happens when Japan's government decides to become tyrannical?
15944	Yeah openness and only one platform mix very good	Reading PC Gamer when suddenly... I caught a glimpse of the future.
15945	SHOCKER!	Danks to Have Season-Ending Surgery
15946	Well, until someone comes up with another way to go underwater for 2 minutes, we're pretty much stuck with this, right?	Please, for the love of god do not attempt this. On the other hand people willing to try this won't be around for too long anyway...
15947	Sounds like you need to check your privilege, you typical cissexual misogynistic womyn-hating male pig.	There's nothing wrong with booth babes, though, it's legitimate and functional marketing.
15948	To anyone reading this:	To anyone who has never tried it before, I highly recommend it. Icy hot feels unbelievable. The feeling when you start to stroke your dick while having a handful of icyhot will make you cum so hard your jizz will hit the ceiling
15949	Oh well, if you say so, then	No, he didn't ffs.
15950	Oh, i am so funny for saying something nobody actually thought of.	MW3, a full price game for an overpriced map pack and you get all of your stats reset. Usually, by the 3rd lifeless remake of the same series, reviewers around the globe are calling out the developer/publisher for lack of innovation. For some reason though, the only negativity regarding this game is found by individual user reviews. Are our gaming news sites controlled by corporations as well? Prepare for the downvote army.
15951	That great spaceship that replaced the shuttle, Soyuz.	Your best friend awakes from a 10 year coma. What is the first piece of technology you show him? I would show him the evolution of Internet radio. SHOUTcast, Last.FM, Pandora, Grooveshark, Spotify, etc. I imagine this technology would be easy to understand and wouldn't be too jarring.
15952	No healthcare is free in any society.	Yep, the movement will be hijacked to introduce draconian tax laws that further burden everyone. A token dogbone will be thrown to the masses, such as 'free' healthcare that you are required to pay for. Meanwhile, the gods of society will retain their clout.
15953	That's fucking stupid.	For all you easterners, a 5 point deer under the western standard means 5 points on each antler. A 5x5. Or what you easterners would call a 10 pointer.
15954	OR THE CHAMPION OF THE ACC	I've kept up the vitriol for 7 years, I think I can handle a few more weeks. Hey Texas, your coach is a whiny cry baby. That said, Austin is the best city in Texas, but that's like being the "smartest Texan" or the "least slutty girl at SMU."
15955	What are you, a communist?	Isn't policy supposed to represent the people?
15956	4 sentences too long YAWNN	Evolution is just a theory!? My reply- Scientific Theory: A framework of interconnecting facts. Any contrary fact would destroy the framework. The mountain of facts is growing every day!
15957	Yeah, because whining certainly will.	It's the people like you that they love. Keep on thinking working hard will get you somewhere.
15958	NO it is cod, therefore it is bad	It's actually not half bad.
15959	Indeed, they are needed in Pakistan.	let's shelf the devil's advocacy for a minute, and remember the fact that complete troop withdrawal from a nearly 10-year long unnecessary conflict is objectively good news.
15960	Corporations are people too.	The Trans-Pacific Partnership would create a virtually permanent corporate rule over the people.
15961	It's not a bug, it's a feature so you can see if you bought the correct item or not.	Game freezes for like 2 sec after buying an item. Any1 else has this ? Literally freezes for about 2 sec after every single item is bought.
15962	Yeah, you can consider them novelty items.	ok, that makes sense. but what's the point of sending people these mini amounts if they are never able to send them further, hmmm...
15963	Pretty sure it's getting a buff too	does the mantis chain gun = warthog turret?
15964	Fucking France.	Current Flight path between Portugal and Switzerland due to French ATC Strike
15965	Don't tell me what I can and can't judge!	Don't judge the book by it's cover. It might be a staff member!
15966	I'm pretty sure that other picture was of the North Pole (considering the location the flags).	Tell your friend to take a pic at the REAL pole next time!
15967	I LOVE YOU P3	I LOVE YOU AISHA'
15968	i have him tagged as "wat" because that's my reaction to most of his stuff.	I have him tagged as "GIFs for Every-fuckin-thing" because he literally has a GIF (or picture) for everything.
15969	Girl Guide camp... shrinkage?	Skivvies?? But then everyone would see my.... SHRINKAGE 0-0
15970	Same!	To be honest. The comments where i mention that i'm bi are the comments i get most upvotes :D
15971	Good luck, the cops have been trying to win that game for a year now.	So I took a crack at playing this game last night
15972	CNN ran something about black market sells of AK-47s (USSR surplus) a create was going for $400 US.	* "Gun shows have proven to have a correlation with crime" In Colombine the guns used were bought at a gunshow. In the Batman shooting the guns were bought at a gun show. The big problem isn't in America. The Cartel buys the guns in El Paso TX at a higher mark up price. What they can't buy at a gun show they buy from people exiting the gunshow for upwards of $10k I live in El Paso and have seen this first hand. Mexico is also a great example why I am pro-gun. Citizens have a hard time getting a gun legally. As a result the cartel has them outgunned. * " More manditory education for gun owners" How is the irony palpable. Owning a gun is a responsibility, you should know what your state laws are. Texas (despite reputation) has a pretty decent record with making sure hand gun owners are educated. I've seen other states that are a joke when it comes to this.
15973	No, I don't.	Redditors: Do you even lift? Please respond!
15974	As someone that played before there was a dodge penalty and routinely had 40 min+ queues to wait through all I can say to you is that **YOU ARE A MORON**.	I really think that dodging should be encouraged not punished. Its the nicest thing you can do really. Also i think you should be able to enter the queue with telling the system your preferred roles etc so it can match you up accordingly to avoid conflict.
15975	They've mentioned in interviews that both Scott and Emma survive.	I was so sure Scott or Emma was gonna bite it. So who does that leave, Colossus or Namor? Or an Avenger. I'm actually kinda curious who will die at the end of AvX now.
15976	You act as if they have some kind of choice in the mater.	That is seriously insane. How can they tolerate it?
15977	I would have loved to have seen a goal, or some subs to add to the chances, but I completely understand why he didn't	Exactly right. I see Arsenal supporters worldwide asking the sub question now, but I saw in the game why no subs came on - especially towards the end.
15978	We are next in line...	Lot's of conservative trolls since r/conservative was taken over by r/politics.
15979	There's a few of them.	What sort of plane out there costs $200 million?
15980	Ah the Great Place.	Extreme outdoor recreation in Texas
15981	No prob man, we were newbies at one point.	yeah i feel bad for posting it now. this is my first year playing. I knew it was a bad trade. though just not THAT much of a bad trade. thanks for the help man.
15982	STILL HERE, BUT FUCKING OFF IF THEY GO FULL RETARD ON BANS AND PICKS AGAIN.	WHERE ARE THE C9 "FANS" FROM WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP?
15983	It's not.	Jeez, I hope college turns out to be as fun as this.
15984	You had to have the last word, last night	All your friends were so knocked out
15985	No one has the heart to tell him.	My name is Trevor, and I look like Barack Obama.
15986	This is the first time I've ever seen this meme	After being on reddit a while I've started to notice...
15987	lady has clearly forgotten her duty to be an object first and foremost	"This woman doesn't please my peeenis waaahhhh" - this thread
15988	Both sides, right or wrong, often come across as "Yarble yarble, you are acting like an idiot"	When I was hardcore into politics in college, I just went along with the anti-gun message because I didn't know any better. Then a bunch of nice guys brought me out to a range and after that I reevaluated my position on guns. That ultimately cemented after I saw how anti's launched misguided attacks after the Dark Knight shooting. It just seems like most gun control advocates haven't really thought about the issue and assume all things on their party's platform are correct. You're right, confronting doesn't change views as well as being friendly and offering new experiences.
15989	The big about vaughn made me laugh.	The Downfall of Rob Ford's Subway Vision - YouTube
15990	Again, did you read what you wrote?	the media was made to look stupid because he sat out?
15991	They definitely have, we used proxies for about 2 years before they caught on.	Ummmm have you tried proxy sites? That's what I always did... Given I'm 23 and maybe schools have caught on to proxy's by now
15992	first time i have seen this	Neighbors gave me a sweet gift
15993	The overlord who feeds it, massages it, and most importantly, cleans up its shit.	I always thought of it as an offering for being a kind overlord.... I could be wrong though....
15994	Well for one FLStudio is more of a sequencer than a DAW.	Well, that's what I figured, but I'm asking if there are any fundamental differences that makes, say, Pro Tools a "better" DAW.
15995	Alright, I'll try that, thanx :)	I'm sure if you google it you could find a rocket club relatively near by. I have to drive an hour to the launch spot.
15996	Cliff hangers, bro.	First MTM Black Lapel Suit - Thoughts on Fit?
15997	Too late actually.	Too soon?
15998	Because the familiarity of a beloved character promotes thier "sooper-sekret reddit nerd-club"?	Hey reddit, check out my drawing of Ian McKellen with a wizard hat and beard. So much for originality. Why can't we see a new design for Gandalf? Why does it have to be something that could have been traced from a promotional photograph?
15999	Because all teenagers are dumb/delusional and obviously have no idea how the REAL world works.	Why on earth does her age matter?
16000	I love popular opinion bear.	I am not a violent man
16001	It cost me 30$ + 42$ shipping.	but.. What's the price tag on it?
16002	Sorry, it's definitely creepy, but it goes against rule 3!	This isn't a PM, but I do have a YouTube channel, and this was one of the creepiest comments I've ever received.
16003	Very funny orignal definitely not a circlejerk	These Worlds matches are taking too long. It's taking away time from this excellent analyst desk!
16004	yeah	Electricity, portland cement, and plastic in religious places should be considered ungodly. I sound like a luddite, but heck it would be awesome. Imagine rock temples with oil lamps and live music if any.
16005	Ben AflecK?	"sir, our facial recognition software works on faces only, not rear ends."
16006	FIFU?	This is what happens when people refuse to pay taxes. FIFU.
16007	SO POWERFUL	Freedom.
16008	So refreshing that someone took a break from the Amanda Todd jerk to return to our regularly scheduled beaten to death potato jokes	can still count to potato
16009	No wonder that (FINAL MISSION) [guard in the Big Score shut up and took the gold brick.]	No. I used to be an armored car guard back in the day when security was a concern. Nowadays it's all about delivery times and money saved. Safety is lowest on the list of priorities. Armored Car guards used to get paid really well. Now it's basically minimum wage.
16010	Someone who works very hard?	He's exactly what lazio supporters deserve as their emblem-player...
16011	Confirmed by reddit: Julian Assange is *literally* Hitler.	Not sure Bruno Ganz would have gotten Hitler's approval for Downfall. Note: Not comparing Assange to Hitler.
16012	I hear Seattle has an emerging tech industry.	The wifi on the boat is operational! The yachters in Seattle are years ahead of us!
16013	Yeah, I also get creeped out when my confused body is turned on by boobs regardless of how young they are.	Ephebophilia is still creepy.
16014	anecdotal evidence is the best evidence	I like the guy claiming a part of his molar came off, and he stuck it back on and it healed. And how he hasn't been to the dentist for 20 years and his teeth have changed color and broken apart but it's all proof that teeth just heal on their own and this is proof no one really needs dental work.
16015	Does watching games on The Price is Right count at making me a gamer?	You're officially gamers.
16016	Look amazing now.	Always went with lighter shades in the past, so this time I dyed my hair black!
16017	Actually before that she updated and said everything was fine.	She deleted her post. I bet it was a troll.
16018	Yeah but he's not a hero.	Dad was born same way in the 60s, survived being shot. Getting kicked in the head by a bull and cancer. The man is tougher than any person I know. Seriously
16019	Please tell me more about how ethics or metaphysics are falsifiable.	Philosophy and science are closely related, and build upon each other. Philosophy generally addresses questions which are falsifiable, which is fundamentally different to questions which people simply deem to be permanently outside the purview of scientific investigation and therefore unfalsifiable. Religious claims fall into the latter. As if there is a certain class of knowledge which you're not allowed to look at scientifically, and must accept on the basis of nothing more than a gut inclination, or "faith", which varies from person to person and doesn't actually mean anything beyond "What I think about stuff".
16020	Yes, because he does not care when his explicit prohibitions are violated.	I very much doubt Allah cares if non-muslims enter Mecca.
16021	Yeah, she wasn't even democratically elected 3 times in a row, what a dictator!	100% of dictators and tyrants? Explain Margaret Thatcher.
16022	The originality of the jokes on this thread are amazing.	An Irish sunset
16023	Nah she should just quit overreacting about it.	Even leaving out the minor part, it's still blatant sexual harassment.
16024	The unwilling participation in any activity, sexual or non-sexual.	If you don't mind my asking, how would you define rape?
16025	Oh OK stranger I'll accept that	University prof. It's pretty much agreed upon.
16026	I won't hold my breath.	Lets not get too outraged, they can still protest if they propose a different route. We will see how this develops
16027	Yes, it must be terribly difficult being different in this day and age; because it's so hard being different, we should totally blame white males!	Finally, a white male on reddit willing to speak out about how hard it is to be a white guy and how we don't need to do anything about racism or sexism.
16028	I, too, consider my opinions to be facts and think the people that disagree with me or feel differently only do so because they're stupid.	So they cater to idiots. Well considering how easy it is to get gear on WoW it's not surprising.
16029	That guy with the bouncing betty wasn't lucky - he saw you aiming back to throw the knife and blocked it with the BB...kind of a badass if you ask me	My little TDM montage thing. Isn't that great I know sorry.
16030	Yeah, Maybe they can cure the gay out of people too..	If we have some magical machine which will remove unorthodox thought from a human mind, why place any limits? What a wonderful world it would be if no man were capable of thinking a thought not approved by Oxford.
16031	Yeah child abuse doesn't happen anywhere else except America.	What the hell is wrong with you America? sheeeeeesh
16032	I applaud you for your originality.	DAE Atheism?
16033	Yea a legendary MMA fighter with good charisma is a horrible signing, they should have signed a up and comer.	TNA sign Rampage Jackson
16034	Cheesesteak with raw onions and peppers.	"Philadelphia Crunch", I really like that name but can't think of anything to give it to, any ideas?
16035	Yeah, definitely isn't applicable to the military.	This can't really be applied to real life...
16036	Someones got to foot the bill to reward our hardest workers!	Incomes of bottom 90 percent grew $59 in 40 years
16037	That would never happen to a good old Christian ...	its no secret that these islam scum have been misogynistic women abusing pedophiles that date all the way back to the bastard child mohammed the faggot.
16038	Perhaps they could bring back the guillotine and so it's like French revolution all over again.	France to deport radical Muslim clerics
16039	Interesting in the way she frames it so that women are never really the victims, it's only the men?	girlwriteswhat's comment is interesting.
16040	No no but it was *insulting* an had to be removed.	Crying...while on the computer (no true personal contact)...over a children's card game?
16041	yeah but walt is an expert crystal grower, so he was able to do it in a meth lab.	He's saying that with such a large single crystal (which would be fantastically difficult to produce without specialized multimillion dollar equpiment), stressing the crystal even slightly could cause enough piezoelectric potential to spontaneously detonate.
16042	Well it's obviously because of the homosexual agenda!	Why is it becoming popular to not like hot chicks? i just dont get it....
16043	silly rabbit, thinks he can just go around free trading willy nilly!	That's not your apartment you're renting, it's the state's apartment you silly billy.
16044	Yeah any person who enjoys dubstep has no musical taste and should be ignored completely about anything related to music because they're stupid.	Well...that was awesome. Kurt would've loved that. /anyone hating on this has no understanding of how great that was. Go back to your dubstep.
16045	Maybe you could put in pet freeze too, but that might require too much skill	that is correct, except there is a frost nova in the middle to get extra frozen procs.
16046	But this misses the point: The rich own/control *both* political parties *and* the mass media that report on these issues.	Add It Up: Taxes Avoided by the Rich Could Pay Off the Deficit
16047	Oooh, a sweater...	I think it is ok if couples are willing to compromise. At the end he does show up in a sweater so he was willing to change as well.
16048	Because "snagging a man" would have fixed all her problems... women are not empowered, after all, to captain their own destinies.	Why, its true in her case. She ran out of money in the college town after graduation and 2 years unemployment and was forced to move back into a small town which is completely gentrified and the only way to afford anything besides an apartment is to marry someone and work in the tourist industry or hope for a job at the meatpacking plant that ships to Asia. Roommates who braid each others' pubic hair while listening to Sarah McLaughlin don't buy houses together, sorry to ruin your femdreams. I'm her sister and she has said this of herself multiple times.
16049	Someday the carriers will charge us a reasonable amount for data without keeping track of minutes, text messages, tethering or any other arbitrary method they use to rip us off.	I had read that the phone is supposed to be penta-band. If that's true, it will work! Roll-over is never coming - the way it is now is simply too profitable
16050	Yeah, cause Jennifer Grahnholm did such a bang up job creating jobs here in Michigan.	Jennifer Granholm, former governor of Michigan: "Facts show Democrats are job creators"
16051	That's surprising!	$220 Million Battleship Flop Sinks Universal Pictures
16052	Great observation, I would have never noticed that without your insight.	HE FLIPPED THE FUCKING MUSHROOM!!!!
16053	No, that's the chemicals from the dye they added in to make it look fresh.	Is this why my sushi glows in the dark?
16054	Because it's funny when women kill men.	Ken shouldn't have been hanging around with those bratz dolls.
16055	Its a good thing glocks are all plastic so a scanner won't pick it up.	NYPD looks to scan people on the street for guns
16056	TIL ancient aliens deposited whales in the Chilean desert.	TIL there is a mysterious "whale graveyard" in the Chilean Atacama Desert with fossils of over 75 whales
16057	also make sure its plugged into the wall and turned on.	Still can't get a signal to the monitor So yeah I've posted this a few times before, but at this point I have no idea what to do. I've sent my motherboard back about 4 times now, each time it's done something different but the last two times I've gotten it back it just fails to give a signal to the monitor. Specs: 2600k asus z68 motherboard 8GB G.Skill RAM HD 6970 Tried pretty much every trick in the book, starting to think it might be the CPU.
16058	Odd, were they having electrical problems in the area?	This reminds me...I once attended my mom's evangelical church a few years ago. At one point during the service, they prayed for the college students in attendance to act as beacons of light in those schools of darkness, where no other light can be found.
16059	Keep in mind that nicotine also quells your sense of hunger, take a vape break and see if you're just hungry.	All-day vapers: how much do you drink? I've been getting headaches and wondering if it's dehydration related. I do drink a lot and my urine is always clear (sorry if TMI). Wondering how much other people drink.
16060	I thoght he was arrested after he failed to capture those one hundred and one puppies again...	I thought that guy got put to death in "The Man In the Iron Mask"
16061	I would love to see a source on this.	John Adams also said that the Constitution would only work if the US remained religious sooo...
16062	Stay Classy Tuskibear.	Wow, way to put words in my mouth, asshole. I never said the faithful can't be decent people. I never said or implied that I thought you were even Catholic. But you can keep replying to that if that's what you are in to.
16063	Goddamnit OP.	OP never delivered...
16064	I have general and social anxiety disorder as well as clinical depression, and benzos, opiates, and MDMA all destroy my anxiety and make me feel totally sociable, it's nice to not be incredibly awkward and shy all the time :\ also even if I didn't have these issues I'd still do them, feels good man.	Why do you do drugs? I hardly see any discussion threads in this subreddit, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Is this type of post against the rules? I'll gladly take it down or move. I'm just sort of curious about all of you guys. I'm not sure as to why I do drugs exactly. Might be my inherent need to rebel (parents, society, blah blah). I also like to see what my mind is capable of, as silly and as hippy as it sounds, whatever. Aside from my every day drugs (marijuana, caffeine) my drugs of choice are acid, dmt, mushrooms- I like psychedelics; the newfound perspective I get after an experience is something that I really do respect and try to learn from.
16065	man we really have some awesome bands in Australia	Closure In Moscow - The Church of the Technochrist - Official Video (Song's been posted, video hasn't, and it's hilarious)
16066	To be honest, that's my suspicion as well	This is totally speculation but maybe the adjuster is broken?
16067	You play on MTGO or cockatrice?	My boyfriend and me occasionally play magic the gathering online, he taught me how to play it. Also, currently we both like cookie clicker...but that's not really something you do together. We're basically competing to see who can make more cookies per second. You can play games together on a site called omgpop too. We'd sometimes play hangman, or read a book together (obviously we both had our own copies of it) taking turns reading from it out loud. You could watch a tv show or movie at the same time while talking over the phone, this one doesn't work so well skyping/watching something on your computer. I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting.
16068	Can't stand sport in the slightest.	People with ADHD tend to participate in "risky" sports and activities. What's your thrill? My passion is whitewater kayaking. I also love motorcycling (and am currently enjoying a broken collarbone for that one) and, though it's too expensive for me to do regularly, skiing. How bout you?
16069	yup	Serious question: Do you have to throw it over your shoulder when you poop?
16070	That's a bit silly - how would making a huge public announcement of one's change from "Bradley" to "Chelsea" make it likely that people would ever forget that you were once "Bradley"?	I wonder if Bradley changed to Chelsea and from male to female in an effort to separate his current self from his future records....much like prince changing to that sign so he could separate his crap music from his good stuff.
16071	What was he arrested for	I had a friend when I was stationed on Okinawa get arrested (US Military member) and get thrown in a jail for 4 days before they called ANYONE. I had a vague idea he was in trouble that night, and insisted that he isn't AWOL and is being held in prison. Sure enough they finally let him make a phone call. All he ate was old rice and bad fish for 3 straight days. 0 Calls, no bathroom, nothing. This isn't anything new.
16072	Ugambu!	What is your most basic need that is not getting met? Mine is hearing words of affirmation from other people. Sounds trivial but is it really so hard to say "good job," or "I appreciate you" every once in a while?! So it got me thinking, what are some other basic needs that people have and are not getting?
16073	James Taylor.	Easy. Sings slowly and softly and manages to pour so much emotion into his voice that you tear up simply listening to it.
16074	That's not the point.	I agree she its with some dude right now. She will show up in a few days just fine.
16075	But he had that one bad kick in that one game and we need someone who is 100% perfect on every level right out of the gate.	You're giving up on a rookie that is #5 in punting average, #6 in net and #4 in return average? Glad you're not running the team.
16076	At first look, most people would probably do without most of their relationships - except the last, or the ones they really wanted that got away.	Being young and in love is overrated. I didn't have a boyfriend until I was 19 and honestly now I have had a handful that I probably could have done without... including the first one.
16077	Was it pickled?	Foreskin (my first rage comic )
16078	End of Fuck.	end of file?
16079	maybe it comes IKEA style w/ some assembly required ;)	"Builds"? They bought it from Lamassu...
16080	I love me some dragonball z, and i binge-watch because, even though i know whats gunna happen, it always leaves me in suspense for the next episode.	Reddit, what has been your favourite series to binge-watch, and why? Also, with binge-watching on the rise, do you think broadcasters have to up their game to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu?
16081	Or to be more honest, "Some guy outside the NSA makes that claim."	"NSA operatives see what the surveillance subject's eyes are seeing."
16082	If you want to screw around with someone, you want to pick someone as stable as this one?	She appears to be enjoying herself.
16083	CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER YOUR FADED FLAIR	I DON'T LIKE IT!
16084	The Kardashians are one of the few intelligent ones out there!	That if you've made money you're smart, or your opinion is worth more, or you have license to have a large ego. Life is not "the race to accumulate assets and status", and plenty of people make large sums of money without actually being intelligent.
16085	But guys it was totally Justified because	Mass grave uncovered containing dozens of Palestinians killed in 1948 war that founded Israel
16086	Well no smart cop would try to arrest someone who is basically Superman, and can kill you with the power of dubstep.	In Saints Row 4, he *flew* off really fast.
16087	I live in the US now and miss loonies/toonies.	They're very often $2 in countries that have $2 coins, at least. I know one that doesn't even accept loonies, just toonies.
16088	SKC and RSL have both shown they don't need multiple DPs to be successful and the spending would increase for these teams as well in the future.	But I don't really see smaller-market teams like Sporting KC, Portland Timbers, Colorado Rapids, Columbus Crew, Vancouver Whitecaps, Montreal Impact and Real Salt Lake benefiting from it. The bigger players aren't going to want to play for those teams, they are going to want to play for the bigger cities. That is the whole problem. We don't want to see the West Coast &amp; East Coast dominate MLS titles. It should be equal opportunity for every team. The top two teams with the most MLS Cup wins so far are LA Galaxy and DC United, obviously the biggest west coast city, and DC is part of the Northeast Megalopolis.
16089	Ok, that was uncalled for.	If that fat girl is so concerned with health, maybe she should lose a few pounds. This chemophobia is absolutely getting out of hand.
16090	They aren't playing Texas so it should be ok	I dunno, I honestly think it's some of the best in the nation. Some real fuck ups in that Tech/TCU and then the infamous Iowa St/Texas game but really I felt like throughout the year there were a lot of great calls.
16091	YOU ARE A RACIST, EVIL DEVIL WHITEY!	TIL Muhammad supported the murder of a woman who insulted him
16092	Your dad's name is "Cool"?	While my mom doesn't know any Mitch Hedberg jokes, nor does she visit Reddit, she is also pretty fucking cool.
16093	100% the worst in the history of humanity.	I have Martin Jones as my goaltender... Does that make me a terrible person?
16094	This is going to get big, I need a good comment... Zlatan is good	Zlantan's 4th goal vs England
16095	Nice, a wider backrest for me to lean on!	New poles on the subway! Saw this on an uptown E last night
16096	Very sexy.	Collarbone dermals
16097	He's not stating an opinion, he's stating it as fact.	Because the god he may be thinking of would be observable or perhaps provable. This all depends on if you personally view god as observable. His opinion is just as valid as your own, in this case.
16098	Glad I didn't open this up for work, you know because of all the "not safeness"...	Pornhub comments on stock photos.
16099	SASSAFRASS!	Jay Mohr: Flippin' hilarious. I love when he's on the show.
16100	This is the only caption I will accept for this photo.	Jesus take the wheel!
16101	"Giggity" to any semi sexual thing... So cringeworthy...	Family Guy. 90% of conversations were just exact quotes of entire episodes.
16102	Yeah, the Venutre Bros stuff clogs up Google :(	There's a Venture Bros episode with that title, but that's all I know.
16103	No teaspoon could hold that!	TIL that the particles in Neutron Stars are so close together that a mere teaspoonful would weigh over 1 billion tons on Earth...
16104	Okay, but cold fusion is quackery, let's not forget.	I was just at a talk today that posited runaway electrons leading to fusion as the source of these neutrons.
16105	What's the EL and subsequent XP for killing a player?	TLDR: DM Didn't actually kill a player. The player's character did die in game though.
16106	If someone does something to Uga...	Auburn's trees? Clemson's rock? College football needs an Updyke Law (Scarbinsky)
16107	Even China won't put up with North Korea now, I wonder who are they gonna turn for help... Maybe Japan can relive the glory days and colonize North Korea?	Bank of China Cuts Off North Korea Trade Bank: One of China's biggest banks said Tuesday it has halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the U.S. of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs in the latest sign of Beijing's anger with its estranged ally.
16108	And Cujos to you!	I can't believe I had to scroll even this far down to find an "IT" reference. Cudos you three.
16109	Pulls out knife ... Look up to the skies and see	*sobs* WHY DO WE DO THIS TO OURSELVES? OPEN YOURR EYEESSS..... OH GOD WHY
16110	Like he even benched Ridley after pollard mAde him fumble in the playoffs	Its not just when Ridley fumbles, its when any of his backs fumble. Vereen got benched in a preseason game for fumbling. Ridley got benched in week 1, and Blount in Week 5.
16111	And beat the sweet love of Christ into those damn heathens.	After all, the Aztecs gave *blood* sacrifices. It's a good thing the Spanish brought Christ to the pagan savages before they destroyed themselves.
16112	Because there's no shorthand for sarcasm on the internet.	An option to select Comic sans to show that you are being sarcastic.
16113	It is always the right time to start drinking, somewhere on the planet.	It all starts to make sense now... Is it too early to start drinking?
16114	Sorting and grouping a list with a thousand elements is actually really hard for a computer to do, some computers can take up to a week to do this, especially consoles because they're not as powerful as PCs	Sort. Saves. By. Character. How are we five games in and still don't have this??
16115	Obviously you're a monster and should feel guilty about mutilating your poor sons	Just had my son, born three days ago, circumcised. He was asleep 15 minutes later and hasn't cried since. My first son had a similar experience. I am both an atheist and a biologist. The only reasons I had my sons circumcised was tradition and the fact that it is considered by the AAP to be a medically beneficial practice. What others decide for their own children is fine and doesn't bother me in the least. If somebody decides that I am some sort of horrible person for doing it, that is their problem, not mine.
16116	Should remove the auras altogether.	How about just check the monster mods before attacking a pack in water?
16117	mmm...insect bukkake vomit...	Honeybees and their beautiful honey
16118	Fuckin poor ppl amirite?	Most likely caused by the immense consumption of jelly filled donuts with sprinkles.
16119	You mean Attack on Titan and K-On aren't the best anime ever?	Can we take anime polls seriously for anything other than popularity contests within a narrowed number of voters? Every time I see one of those "best of" polls I can't help but shaking my head. They never choose the best but rather the most popular at the moment of the poll. If the same poll is done a year later, the winners of the previous poll won't get anything. Also I don't believe in giving every vote the same weight, even though that is the point of democracy / voting / equality and stuff. A veteran clearly knows better than a rookie yet his vote is as important as the rookie's. By default most anime fans haven't watched a lot and the veterans are far fewer, so the results are always skewed away from what actually deserves to be the best. I can even say that the MORE people are voting, the MORE skewed the results will be. Last year, SAO was voted by most as the best anime of the year and sold a ton of copies. SSY was loathed, dropped by most, and sold nothing. If the industry takes that into account, then it will of course head for more SAO-like shows instead of SSY-like ones. Checking their average scores today though you actually see SSY having slightly higher average than SAO something that according to polls should not make any sense. But the industry doesn't care about polls as it cares about sales. TL;DR Never trust polls for anything other than popularity and never take part in polls expecting "the best" to be the winner.
16120	look at op being so le random :3	would you fuck a swan if he bought you dinner first?
16121	ecblends dragon's tear	Looking for a good strawberries and cream type flavor. Any suggestions? Howdy all, I've been largely inactive for that last couple weeks due to a move and no internet, but I'm back and ready to pester you all with new questions! Aren't you glad? Anywho, I've tried Moo-juice from MBV and now Roundhouse with Cream from Fuzion. I can't do MBV anymore as I feel like I can taste the chems in it and vapor production compared to "Premium eliquid" is... lacking. Roundhouse with cream is phenomenal, but it's expensive $14.00 for a 15ml bottle bah! (Yes I'm being cheap =p) Any ideas?!
16122	I cannot fathom how the Jeff Probst show didn't last more than a single season.	He's such an idiot. I swear aliens must have replaced the old Jeff with this new one. Does he not realize how far the show has gone down since he's become a producer?
16123	Mate, you ever been to the US?	And when I can walk around a broken fucking ankle,I'm sure pretty much anyone could just fucking, you know, walk. That little bit of exercise form the stroll around the store is better than plonking your ass down in a cart &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
16124	If they refer to their age and add stuff like, "And a half" or "And three quarters"	How young is too young? What is the youngest that you would go in dating someone? When you are in those questionable high school/college years do you think it's wrong to date someone if the laws in this context are relaxed (aka Romeo and Juliet laws) for example if one person is 18 and the other is 16? Does it make a difference if the guy is older or the girl?
16125	Herp durp it will be funny ruining expensive equipment and having to pay for it.	This is what one idiot student put in front of the dustfilter on one of the classrooms projector. Turned it self off after a couple of minutes....wonder why
16126	Obama's proposal to increase taxes back to pre-Bush levels only on 250k earners would have totally balanced the budget, and as we all know higher taxes help the economy.	Oh it's not Obama who's against paying the bills. It's the guys who ran up the bills.
16127	But theres no need for them anymore!	On an unrelated note, this is why labor unions exist(ed).
16128	Goddamned women oughtta be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen making me a goddamned pie!	Hey they wanted to work, if they wanted to have kids they shouldn't have taken the job!
16129	I can get behind it only if the drones are weaponized and capable of delivering pinpoint drops on people drinking large sodas and/or smoking with minimal (&lt;30) bystander casualties.	Why? I'd support drones flying overhead to make sure people aren't violating the soda ban. It's about time we modernize our policing efforts.
16130	there's an implied	Neither is butthurt, but I doubt you're having a hard time understanding what's meant by it's use.
16131	if you don't like a song that native americans are singing you're racist.	Every other goddamn person here is talking about how awesome it sounds and pow-wows and shit
16132	Is that the actress who plays Sansa?	Saw this guys sitting at the bar in NYC by himself. Recognize him?
16133	You don't need front sights when you're spraying those horrible, cop/baby killing, military class bullets.	You'll also notice they sawed off the front site, don't want that getting caught on anything when you're pulling it out of your waist coat : P
16134	Self defense is scary and that's what the police are for!	I don't know why so many liberals seem to think self-defense is bad. This is what happens when people live in a bubble their whole life.
16135	Yep, it's also definitely the first time they ever did something like that.	Theory? Armenia slaughtered entire villages.
16136	Maybe he was taking Smite for lane control.	Well he probably was jungling?
16137	True, it is not the centre... It is the center, commie.	Because America isn't the centre of the world?
16138	Does anybody know if there will be a European release for the 3DS game?	Met Pen Ward today. He signed my sword and i got to ask him some questions (in the comments):0!
16139	Better go to FreeCreditReport.com!	Columbia house subscriber here, I never paid for the remaining 7 CDs I was supposed to order back in 1998.
16140	yeah because getting a constant 60+ fps in gold source games was easy back in the day	playing Counter-strike with a CRT monitor, didnt need THE BEST computer either, and viola, a solid WAY over 60 fps... also no delay on those monitors. ^(come again?)
16141	But then it's not his fault!	Actually sounds like you should just hold off on ulti'ing untill naga uses her ulti. Using naga offensively with QoP can be very powerful as you can get in perfect position for an ulti scream combo.
16142	did you let him top you fucking retard?	I love normal draft
16143	I would be, because the fact that smaller breasts are superior to larger breasts is so obvious that there is no argument to be had!	If this thread doesn't turn into a smaller breasts vs. larger breasts argument I will be astounded
16144	Yessir.	Wow... to whatever level you get it to, I'd love to hear it when you've gotten it to "performance" level. --Robert
16145	Actually it does, my comment caused a temporal warp that changed what you had said in the past.	That doesn't change what I said.
16146	Yes, this is exactly what I said.	And that obviously makes you an authority on everything Syrian and Arab.
16147	CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION	It would be shorter for most people.
16148	Right, because hazing has never been tolerated before.	In the new Army we don't do KP. And you can have two wives, embezzle money from the government and still keep your retirement and benefits. Also, hazing Soldiers until they kill themselves will see you only reduced one rank and 30 days confinement. Tell me who's embarrassing the nation, again?
16149	It is perfectly natural, why should we be ashamed of our natural body processes.	Next time you eat at a restaurant

16151	Yeah, the back of her head and left arm is suuuuper attractive.	i thought the model-was a nice picture, attractive. killer shot by photographer.
16152	can you get a new GP?	Have to be referred by your GP in Ontario unfortunately. And no, I'm not going to help her die. And I have every reason to believe that she'd do it herself anyway (There's a history)
16153	Yes, because riding drunk was exactly what he was implying.	because ride a bike drunk is totally secure.
16154	Too bad it's scratched up.	Found this fine piece of ass at a flea market.
16155	Not only that, also you have to be an Arabic native speaker to get the "correct" meaning.	But you're reading the translation and you obviously don't understand what the verses mean! :)
16156	Battery life on today's phones suck?	Mobile Phones, Then and Now
16157	anything i don't understand isn't art	It isn't for your taste, therefore it's not poetry?
16158	Well isn't this new and exciting, we have never seen this posted before.	Possible Draft/Ranked Solo Queue Fix? To be totally honest, this has probably been mentioned before in some way, shape or form. Regardless, would it be possible to implement a system where you select the role you want to play as a part of choosing what queue you want to enter and then are subsequently matched with people to fill the other four roles? I understand there are problems with this concerning imbalanced amounts of people wanting to play each position, but are the numbers close enough to be viable? Again, this has probably been brought up but, if not, lets hope that I can get some feedback so I can understand why this wont work.
16159	Patriarchy made them do it.	These women are just victims of rape culture... somehow.
16160	They are released into local streams and ponds.	Since the supermarket can only keep lobsters for a few days, what happens to unsold lobsters? The store sells Lobster bisque and chowder so some of it ends up there, there are pre-cooked tails and tins of lobster meat, but there are a lot of lobsters in a tank, they can't all end up in soup. Where do they go?
16161	I am not convinced!	No downvote, because I am assuming you're joking. (2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2)*0 = 0 take out () and its 28
16162	Ya, I'm totally ganna do that, thanks!	Argue against science. It will make you stand out, and seem more courageous. Arguing against something you believe in strengthens your tactics and debate skills. If you actually have decent points it will make your unique debate much more engaging and memorable.
16163	Quit being an asshole!	Up vote to you sir!
16164	Now that's the spirit!	People like me who don't have thousands of dollars of disposable income? Yeah, I'm a terrible person. I should stop donating the small amounts I can afford to animal shelters like I do and go kill a lion, because that will make the world a better place.

16171	I feel ya, same with me and my fundamentalist Christian parents.	That Allah is real. I don't believe it, but I pretend I do only for the sake of &amp; in front of my parents. They'd die if they knew the truth about my agnosticism.
16172	Stop triggering me with your being triggered!	I'm a batshitcrazykin! I'm a crazy person trapped in a sane persons body! If you don't acknowledge me for the insanity I identify with you are literally trigger raping me. Educate yourself shitlord!
16173	I think many American Jews share you sentiment.	As an American Jew, I find it disgusting that Mitt Romney will say, or do, anything in Israel to try to earn my vote.
16174	I abandoned a pay pal account that had a positive balance of about $100 just because I was tired of fucking with those people.	I had been using Paypal off and on for random eBay purchases for years. Nothing major, nothing huge. Was tied to my old bank account, verified, all the good stuff. My friend sends me 25$ via Paypal to repay me for something and I initiate a transfer to my checking account and my Paypal account goes into lockdown mode. They freeze the money. They then demand that I send them a scan of my driver's license and a copy of my most recent bank statement but won't give me the address to send it (yes, physical mail) because you need to log into your account (again, frozen) and speak to a representative to get it and I couldn't use the phone help because I no longer had the number that I originally registered the account with and they wouldn't help unless I was calling from that number. All this after five or more years of totally benign transactions, some of which were larger than the measly 25$ my friend sent me.
16175	I wasn't, but I may start now after being lost long enough.	Are you drawing your own guide like a lot of people did when it first came out?
16176	I imagine that certain wikki pages like this one will be filtered as part of the new porn filter in the UK 'for the children'	TIL the Queen of England has two mentally handicapped cousins, who were disowned by her family and essentially declared dead. One was buried in an unmarked grave, the other is still ignored.

16183	Huh?	Are you that Alzheimer's person from IAmA?
16184	Detroit.. $10.00 can get you a house and a meal	How expensive is it to live in your city? I think it would be interesting to know: How much do people earn on average (maybe you can estimate) How much rent do you pay (is that in the expensive or cheap part of town?) How much does it cost to go out?

16191	Stores run out of games all the time, what planet are you from.	Pre-ordering back then made some sense, as stores were likely to run out of copies of some of the more popular games. These days it never happens, and pre-ordering games for anything other than day-of-release delivery or steam preload is nothing other than giving the developers a loan and a free pass for a potentially terrible game.

I am in Georgia, and the car is in California. I went through SunTrust and I was approved but they changed their minds when they learned the car is in California. I then tried Lendingtree, CapitalOne, BOA, USBank, and Chase to no avail. They either won't give it to me for the same reason as SunTrust or they won't lend on the car because it is a *1995* model. Anyone that can shed some light for me, I appreciate it.

16208	Yeh tell the people in Chicago that were killed by gang bangers that the super strict gun ban didn't kill them	Some people, perhaps only those whose ancestors were liquidated in the Holocaust and perhaps those sympathetic to said plight, might view it as a colossally insensitive analogy to invite comparisons between curbing or banning an inanimate tool that is voluntarily used to commit violent acts with the literal attempt to completely eradicate a race of people from the face of the earth, an event which in the real world cost 6 million people their lives and unspeakable suffering for others, all while precisely zero people have died because of attempts to ban or curb the aforementioned tool. Maybe they're crazy oversensitive bleeding heart types and this is a reasonable comparison to make though, I don't know.

There'd be a significant increase of voters first of all, I know its prone to hacking but come on, what isn't? This would also give people more power in politics which is definitely what congress doesn't want. PROgress or CONgress? I pick progress!

16238	Hilarious	So this is the way we told my girlfriends parents she's pregnant
16239	Just because you don't know them doesn't mean you don't have children, Jamal.	I'm a 31-year-old heterosexual black male, but I have no children.
16240	I'm sure adding a source of private handgun ownership to the drug gangs of London equation would reduce violence.	Isn't England the violence capital of the EU?
16241	The first time that has been properly said in a while.	Thanks Obama
16242	Their art is just 3deep5u.	it pisses me off people like this can't get their shit into museums, but some pretentious asshole who puts a basketball and a wooden alphabet block next to each other get into the Guggenheim
16243	But haven't you heard, it slows down the game!	the only way i can see the ref thinking it was off of illinois is because it glanced off of the underside of the backboard. i don't doubt for a second that he saw it come off of kadji's hand, but maybe he thought the change in trajectory was off of paul. in either case, the rules need to be amended allow that to be reviewed since they review just about everything else.
16244	did you hear, they're going to fix the spit bridge?	Like every other NSW infrastructural project, I'll believe it when I see it.

16246	You must be at the wrong bar.	People always say he's the kind of guy you'd wanna have a beer with. I don't really look around a bar and think "hey somebody here should run for president"
16247	This would've never happened if only licensed and trained lumberjacks were allowed to have saws.	Saw-wielding robber stole cash register in Connecticut
16248	You mean individual anecdotes are not sufficient evidence to counter significant statistical data?	15 civilians died during a Tibetan riot in 2008. At least 36 civilians died from Iraqi insurgents targetting sectarian differences just last Monday. Violence is commonplace in the Muslim world, but in Tibet its so notable that calls for a Wikipedia entry. In any sufficiently large group you'll find all types of characters. Many issues are at work. Perhaps it's common in the Muslim world because jihad, martyrdom and fetishizing the afterlife are tenets of their belief system.
16249	Yeah, the cops aren't what they were in 1963.	Bro, go outside. Cops aren't what they were 50 years ago.
16250	I'm a gamer, I switched to Windows 8.	Fuck you Microsoft, just fuck you. No gamers are going to switch to Windows 8. I feel like Microsoft is making all the wrong business decisions here. Windows 8 is just going to rip people off as a glorified tablet operating system.
16251	CHECK YOUR ABLE BODIED PRIVILEGE, SCUM!	As someone who partakes in sports gambling, I can say that its getting really difficult to handicap the Paralympic Games.
16252	You are rewarding the people who never exercise and win all the time	If you're not ready for this, start with 10 pushups for a win, 20 for a loss.
16253	OH MY GOD ITS A PENIS THAT'S SO FUNNY	I can't say my neighbours were as impressed as I was..
16254	you forgot	This is why I'm glad I'm Christian, we never do crazy stuff like that.
16255	Give up or become too confused that it erodes enthusiasm (which they've succeeded at in many ways).	The entire campaign is being run as an attempt to try to get those in opposition to give up. It's not about what Walker has done positively because, let's be honest, he hasn't done anything positive. Instead it's about trying to make those opposed to Walker give up.
16256	But, but, going that fast is dangerous!	Agreed, and on another note if you or your car are not so good at winter driving then please pull over and let the line of cars behind you pass. There is nothing worse than going 25mph when you have studded tires and enough skill to go 40+ safely.
16257	Na, I'm not really capable of thinking like that, so let's just call it Jesus.	Stay with me, but where I end up on that thought is... So we humans control more and more right? What if we just kept controlling larger and larger things and spreading further and further into the universe. Soon we're controlling asteroids... planets... stars. Maybe not super fast, but we move them as we wish. Larger and larger this builds up. More and more stars bent to our will. Galaxy's bent to our will. Then, what if we look on that from a huge scale. The galaxys follow rules that are a new physics on this level of size. What is billions of years to our size is the equivalent of seconds on this scale and we are what make the universe more at that scale. What if this already happened? What if what really controls particles is another life itself so small as to be only recognizable on massive scale of atoms. Maybe that's why matter seems to follow rules that break down when we look too close. Maybe it's really just life all the way down and all the way up. Maybe there is nothing else.

16268	Oh look a gun, the owner must be a career criminal with a long record; I doubt very much that they just want to protect themselves since the gun laws in NYC are 100% effective at stopping gun crime.	Outside my hotel window in NYC.
16269	Yeah, Apple's product strategies are all about "the next fiscal quarter".	They need to keep making even more money through even bigger earnings, every single quarter, to keep the share price climbing so their investors and owners (and CEO) can keep making healthy profits. Every little stream of revenue that adds to their earnings is welcome. And even if they won't make a lot of money selling user data today or next year, who knows how much they could make from it in three or five years? Who would have thought 15 years ago that a "simple" music playing device would be the biggest source of earnings for a Computer company like Apple, or that a phone would take the music device's place as the top earner after only a couple of years? Building and selling computers is but a minor part of Apple's revenue and earnings today.

16278	-The Government	Good. This isn't like a guy who is a first time offender and is sorry for his mistakes. This guy is a fucking ass wipe whose been arrested and put in prison before for credit card fraud and various other shit. I know him personally and he's kind of a little shit. I will be quite blunt, but I believe he is much less about actual caring for the causes that he claims he is an activist for, and much more about wanting to justify his criminal behavior. Don't feel sorry for him. He wants you to think he was the victim of some grand governmental conspiracy to keep all of us down. Truth is, he's just an asshole and he's better off removed from society.

16285	They were talking about Kaesong on NPR earlier how things were still 'operating normally'	its crazy that i get my news from reddit now before any news organization. this has been reported for hours and hours yet every major news organization hasnt reported it until an hour ago. from now on ill check reddit before shit stained cnn.

16289	No, the rule change was that they would be shooting fouls last year, now they're just like a reach in foul or something so they don't take you to the line, but when the other team is in the penalty it sucks because he'll still get the free throws.	They invented a new rule to stop giving him those bullshit sweep through fouls, but somehow the refs keep calling it anyway.
16290	Yes, all human with all the baggage all of us have and the mixed set of tools we have to work with and achieve, or fail, professionally and personal.	Some of my favorite artists/musicians/actors/writers are horrible, horrible people. Not proud of that, just stating it.

16300	The way you wrote about it in your initial comment made it sound like it was an interesting theory because there may be some truth to it, but there isn't.	Yes, that solves everything. Pack up, nothing to see here. That means no one should even read about it.

16305	Well an era is defined as a significant period of time, so good or bad they believed the 21st kicks it all off.	I will now, thank you. I will be at this all day. I did find out that no one knows what will happen. That just makes my anxiety and curiosity peak more. The day they say something will happen, will be here on friday..I'm not going to lie but I will freak out more on Thursday. It does soothe me that they believe it will be the beginning of a new era. I hope that is a good thing.
16306	You're vastly underestimating the toll one NBA game takes on your body.	Their schedule was: 1. Washington (W) 2. NO GAME 3. Orlando (W) 4. Heat (L) 5. NO GAME 6. NO GAME 7. Memphis (W) 8. NO GAME 9. NO GAME 10. NO GAME To be honest, this only boosts my opinion. I was under the impression they had games the days prior and games the days following the Heat game. They really need that much rest to play against two good teams in a four day span? No way. Especially after coming off two EASY wins.
16307	YouTube comments are the worst thing on the Internet.	The number of YouTube comments shouting with wild indignation that this guy stole this entire routine from another video of himself doing the same bit...Jesus. If you ever want a good approximation of how stupid people can really be, think of someone trumpeting "This guy stole this entire joke from that other guy at the Laugh Factory, word for word!" while ON THE INTERNET, but lacking the ability to somehow connect the fact that it is the same comic, and this is his routine. I went from bemused to baffled to irked to angry to fed up to disgusted so fast that I've now gone to a place far beyond emotion. I'm in a blank state with a mild headache and thirty fewer IQ points, and all of my senses will only register cardboard.

Umm he still thinks the internet is a fad and the "just do it don't ask questions" I got all my life has made me have to learn everything I know myself.

16321	Fluorescent lamps have a filament for starting at each end.	Fluorescent bulbs, in a classical sense, don't have a filament, nor do LED bulbs. Most other consumer bulbs, however, operate in a similar fashion: heat up tungten in a vacuum.
16322	Yes because the publishers really care about that.	Exactly instead of adding this "New" gamemode with LeBron focus on what's worked before and make it better.
16323	I hope the people commenting are pointing out how disgusting that is and not asking for prices.	Here is a translation. "Hi, I'm selling my dildo collection - have been used extensively but are in good condition and they have a cleaning bag that follows.

16329	All you can eat sushi for 18 bucks sounds terrible.	Cosmetic set Discussion: Pricing I'm a big fan of the new sets that recently came out but I find issue with the fact that the new Mirana set is considered "mythical" and priced at 17.99 while the previous set is "legendary" and priced at 17.99. Why not label them both mythical. personally I even think the Lion looks cooler than the owl. Also, while I value the hard work the artists put into these cosmetics I feel that the price of the cosmetic limits purchases. 17.99 is a bit much. I would definitely snag it up at 11.99 or less but for now I'm gonna pass and buy all you can eat sushi. I think they could sell 3x the amount they do at 17.99 if they listed for 11.99 instead. Just an opinion

16333	Or equalism.	Feminism gives feminism a bad name, for people who actually give a shit about everyone there is humanism.
16334	Ya because I am arguing legality.	There needn't be loss in order for it to be illegal. The band provides a service, and in order for you to enjoy it, they want to be paid. That's wrong, and it should be illegal.
16335	If you're old enough to remember that, you're too old to drive!	Oh good, I'm not the only one on here old enough to remember that!
16336	Maybe if they were playing with paintball guns, but real guns is just wrong	I would have loved to do something like that growing up... If not for the fact that the enemy in their game is Israel, and that they're probably not preaching peace and love, I would see nothing wrong with it. Hell, some christian camps in the states are more extreme (If in a different way).
16337	In one study, 65% of the respondents that were classified as rape victims didn't think they were.	It's isn't a lie. Most of them don't agree it was rape, either. If you ask most men and most women if they've ever had sex when they were intoxicated, many people would say yes. Not many of them thought it was rape, but some studies classify it as one.
16338	Dude, just because they have bigger balls than you going around using their brake calipers to stop, running on tyres with no tread in the snow and crabing across the road every hundred feet doesn't make them idiots.	I think it balances out with the idiots who drive them....

I stood on top of a fire with in inflammable shield; I took damage when the shield was depleted. So ironically a fire immunity wouldn't save you when you actually need it to...
16342	For such a talented woman to *not* pass on her genes is a shameful example of selfishness!	Betty White, Childfree at 91... She'll probably change her mind though.
16343	yea, who knows what will happen, it's not like there are patterns or anything	You "understand" nothing in particular. Monkeys are about as good at estimating the movements of the financial or housing markets as informed investors. Stop trying to pretend you are an authority in guesswork.
16344	Welp, that's all the prove I need.	Yeah they were
16345	That "our woman" part means he and his nigga friends keep a woman in their basement.	Tupac had all the answers..
16346	Stanford didn't win any championships and they literally had Luck	What it want from it is WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT? Because I can say the B1G has 6 championship caliber teams too, if I don't tell you what I mean by that. And even in defining it, you make it more vague. How do I know if a team "should" win a game? What does "stack up well" mean? Any team has the potential to be "championship caliber," because winning a championship takes, above all, a shitload of luck.
16347	This is terrible and you should feel bad.	Good guy E-bus driver (happened to me last night, xpost from r/Austin)
16348	Im thinking that the "new engine" frostbite engine is that they change the blue filter to a yellow one	Honestly, BF4 looks like BF3. Shadowfall looks next gen.
16349	Come on dude, they give you a 25% discount!	I still don't get how this is a thing. I mean I totally get most religion. It's appeal is part tradition, part comfort, and part community, I just don't see how Scientology has this. It obviously has no tradition. It's comfort depends on how much cash you have. Is there an actual community? Does Scientology have "church" like community centers?
16350	Because he's white.	how can you possibly know this
16351	In their defense, they also do a shit job of staffing everyone else.	It's very real. For being the hub of training &amp; development for any company, HR departments do a shit job of staffing themselves.
16352	Wow, I bet your friend isn't going to fucking regret this.	I drew the Flying Spaghetti Monster for a friend so he can get it as a tattoo. Can I get a r'amen?
16353	Shocking.	Report: Phil Jackson won't be joining Raptors
16354	You mean "best" culture, no?	apparently mixed ppl aren't allowed to recognize their ancestry (unless they're celebrating white "culture")
16355	sounds like a hilarious show.	DAE see the tv crew on South Congress doing pranks? A couple of friends came to visit so I took them to South Congress to check out the shops. While we were walking back to the car a "blind" man stopped us to ask for help. He said he was meeting his fiance for lunch and needed help locating a restaurant. He said she texted him the cross-street and showed his phone to us. The contact name was Sarah with a heart icon next to it. The text said something like this: Hey ___, for the last the time, you are my brother. I don't feel that way about you. As soon as I read this I smiled and knew something was going on. I looked up and saw a camera filming across the street. I looked at the blind guy and then my friend. My friend was still looking at the phone and was clueless. I wanted the prank to go on for him so I slowly walked backwards towards the group of friends waiting. The blind guy asked my friend what it said, and my friend read the text out loud. The blind guy was like "oh....really...?" with a sad tone of voice, trying to get a reaction out of my friend. My friend was still oblivious to the whole prank and just said "yea man that's what it says, I don't see any addresses." And then he just walked away haha. When he joined our group, I pointed out the camera and had to explain what was going on. A lady came up to us and asked for our consent and all that. My friend regrets giving the most still reaction but it was a cool experience for them haha.
16356	Wow... this is really amazing.	So I was sitting in the cell phone lot at LAX when suddenly...
16357	One time she wore her hair up for a guy and he didn't even notice.	Source?
16358	No that's racist.	Funny, there are a fuck load of underprivileged white people out there; where is their help?
16359	But what about the man making her do it that they didn't catch?	Mexico's most powerful woman arrested for stealing millions from teacher's union through illegal operations of 2.6 billion pesos.
16360	I should have added	Son is Korean. Asians in big pro leagues tend to be generalized together, and I don't necessarily have a big issue with that, but come on...
16361	Shoot where you want the bullets to go.	Any tips on improving my aim for War Games? For all of you War Game pros do you have any tips you could spare? I feel like my aim is poor enough that the opponent just gets this weird feeling like someone is shooting at them.
16362	You mean domestic empowerment.	It's men who beats women? Even though people who commits domestic violence are in majority women?
16363	Boy are you funny	By opening them up and removing the magnets.
16364	right, because all judges are paid off and the entire justice system is corrupt.	It does not matter how YOU interpret the law, its how JUDGES interpret the law, and if paid off enough, judges will interpret the law VERY loosely.
16365	HIRE HIM TWICE.	And unlike many Redditors, he can spell *paid* correctly. (It's not *payed*.)
16366	No, that is terrible; I believe a government should not force anything on anyone.	Just curious (honest question, no implications from asking): Would you feel any differently if all citizens had to serve a "civic duty" term of 2 years from 18-20, regardless of gender or ability; and that that service would only be military if you put down on your forms that you were willing to be enlisted into combat. Maybe you do clerical office work for the IRS. Maybe you work the counter at the DMV. Maybe you work at a government sponsored day care. Etc etc. 2 years after high school you work for the government in some capacity and then you are sent on your merry way. You go to college, or you apply for work (having 2 years experience working in some capacity you have something to put on your resume at least). Maybe you stay on for whatever government service you were working before if they like you and you like it. I ask because I know a lot of countries (in Europe especially) have that or something similar. Would you feel differently if the mandatory service was combat or military (unless you wanted it to be)?
16367	Thank you for that well thought out and helpful answer.	Yes
16368	But I thought students only perform when their teachers are threatened with bad ratings and/or unemployment.	Giving Teachers Raises Earlier in their Career Correlates to Better Student Performance
16369	Because only women can represent women	The problem is that the republicans made it sound that they would be looking toward women for the future of their leadership, or at least show interest in filling up a little with women. But instead, they went right back to all men.
16370	I'm sure this is the #1 thing on his mind the weekend of his wedding.	what is incontrols answer to all of this???? retirement? triple the practice?
16371	The memes I could do without, but DON'T QUESTION THE CAT PHOTOS.	Good stuff. This is why I joined Reddit in the first place. Too many cat photos and memes have nearly driven me away from this site.

16387	I didn't know that black people are the only type of non-white people.	No one else who has lived in or even gone to school in a place where there are large numbers of blacks has ever concluded that "there are just as many white assholes" as black ones, unless you are literally speaking of their anatomy. In fact most people conclude that blacks and whites are quite different. Your experiences certainly seem to be unique - if they are not pure bullshit.

16409	I thought that a tank was a penis substitute, but you've got real inadequacy issues when your penis substitute needs a penis substitute of its own.	Your gonna need an NFA stamp for that tank suppressor

16428	The clippers	what could you tell someone 5 years ago that happened this season that they wouldn't believe you? For me it would be telling someone that a team of Ron Artest, Steve Nash, Kobe, Dwight Howard &amp; Pau Gasol would just squeak into the playoffs.

16434	You should remind him of "separate but equal" and Plessy v. Fergusson.	My dad and I had a discussion where he suggested that those who think that marriage is sacred and a church thing can keep their marriage, and we just make civil unions have all the same rights as a married couple, thus giving homosexual couples all the rights of a married couple. Just that the straight couple can do their ceremony in a church. I'm paraphrasing hours worth of discussion here, so forgive the simplified language. But my response was that even if you give them all the same rights, but call it something else, you inherently are NOT giving them the same rights. It may just be a word to some, and removing the word might make a lot of people change their minds, but it's still not equality.

16453	Yeah, because we've all seen how the well the developers have taken advantage of the extra power in the the PS3	So.. Still Sony?
16454	Haven't you learned the truth from reddit that every girl ever wants the D.	There isn't anything inherently wrong with making a new friend, but I look at it this way, what if some guy had come over to OP and asked for directions, would he still have wanted to make a friend? Or just give the guy the map and move on as soon as possible? The issue isn't even, would it have been creepin' on the girl. It's the mindset that so many redditors seem to have. That all these encounters with women they have are some how just a hairs width away from blossoming into something romantic or flirty. Sometimes asking for a map is just asking for a map.

16460	Because joking about rape is always something fun to do?	Im pretty sure the joke is that men are mindless rapists. He wasn't being serious.
16461	Yeah, because "evolutionary psychology" is a hard science and that's a fair comparison.	You might as well say the same about evolution and man-made climate change, ignorant people will reject science that doesn't fit their sociopolitical agenda.

16466	said the smelly french boy	Just made this for a thread about slavery. Because of white guilt in the American school system it's better we teach about how we enslaved the people. The Portuguese were the real villains of the tale. They are responsible for most of the slaves in America. We should be blaming them for the blacks oppression. We the Americans were just using what was given to us. The roughest part of a slaves life was the transport to America. When working on plantations they had the easy life slaves were barley ever abused. Before you start bleeding blood out of your asshole take this into thought. You just paid for a very expensive slave that is important for your economic prosperity, would you want to abuse it often hindering it's working capabilities? Hell no you didn't just put a large amount of your assets into it to ruin it, you would want to keep the slave in tiptop shape, well fed, well treated, well clothed. The average slaves life in America was the good life. That's why when slavery was abolished most of the slaves stayed working on the plantation. They liked it, don't you think it would be better then living in some filthy hut in a tribe where no major order is upheld and illness was common? For most slaves the plantation was heaven. This concludes why we shouldn't lay the blame on ourselves as a country but instead on those fucking racist cruel disgusting Portuguese! America should, no needs to go to war on the Portuguese for our black brothas and sistas. Please do America a favor and copy-pasta this to your local senator. It's time to stop these murderers.

16475	That sounds like a really fun way to play the game	And if you want to be a "real" sniper, don't just hide in tall buildings, you also need to be a bit inside it so you blend in with the shadow and the barrel of the gun does not show from the sides. You should also be absolutely still and only keep an eye on small portion of the entire area, even if it means fewer kills for you. And try to communicate with the team so they can at least expect where the enemy is. Don't camp and steal kills, be a teamplayer and a support (as snipers are basically that, unless they are way behind enemy lines taking out high ranked officers)
16476	It was God's will, duh!	totally.........treatable.......diabetes. But we're going to just keep praying as she turns blue.

16479	No, you see, if we don't force people to hire the qualified teachers, they will intentionally seek out the bad ones, duh.	Wouldn't you think that there would be a market for these unemployed individuals to find work in private schools, using their skills in a more efficient manner?
16480	Good, I'm glad everyone is in agreement now.	yes, it is arrogant to say your criticism was based on not bothering to pay attention.
16481	Parking spaces aren't really "required places to park" so much as they are suggestions on where to park.	Some dick took up the only two spaces left at the mall today.. Did I do good?

16483	Good guy boss: Sees you are working too hard so makes it impossible to work	Boss wanted to make sure his staff was working hard. I worked for a private company once and the owner was certain that all of his employees were wasting time online rather than actually doing work. He wants to do something about this so he writes a bit of code and puts it on the server one night. The code monitors all of the websites that get accessed and if the site is accessed more than a set number of times an hour the site gets blocked. Sounds good right? With in ten minutes the next morning the company web site (that we have to access in order to do our business with our clients) is blocked. The next to go was our access to Log Me In, which we used on almost every call to remote in and set up the computers. The next was Google. So now all we get when we go to these sites is a pop up saying "This site has been blocked. You will need to submit a reason why you want to use this site to get access to it." The Boss? He took the morning off and was not answering his Cell Phone. TL;DR - Boss is afraid that his employees are actually working so he blocks the company web site from being used.

16502	I just remember what I have...	Electronics parts inventory database? I am looking around for a good program to get an inventory/organize of all the parts I have in my shop. My first question is does anyone know of any existing software to help with this? It seems most people use spreadsheets, but I want something that prints out labels. If no such software exists I am thinking of writing an android app to do this. Some features I want: * Print labels with QR codes so you can scan the label and bring up the db entry. * Use phone camera to take pictures of parts. (maybe even try to OCR the PN) * Automatically find and download data sheets (probably from octopart) * Compare a project parts list with the parts you have on hand to show what you need to buy/ and check mouser/digikey etc for prices. Would anyone use this? Should it be an android app or perhaps an online app? Any sugestions?
16503	I know people who wouldn't know what "aggregate" or "threaded comments" mean.	a link aggregate with threaded comments why do people think this is so difficult
16504	It's like ghosting didn't cross your mind at all.	remove the 3 min delay on spectate - feature for players to remove the delay when watching a friends game I suggest riot adds a feature that when enabled by everyone ingame it would remove the 3 min delay for spectating. Say we have this in the champion select screen so people can enable/disable it before starting a game. This method would not be able to be abused - say in case someone does not want to have his game spectated live he can just not enable the feature and it would not take effect. *The key here would be: * **if all players (in the same game) agree to allow live spectating they should be able to do so.** Oftentimes I play with friends and we sit over TS or Skype organizing tournaments. It`s really a pain to rely on streaming websites all the time in order to spectate live.
16505	He has an owl, so....	Your capitalization in That title is weird.
16506	Give us enough money to do it, maybe?	Question to all the people in here bitching about their health insurance.

16520	The Christmas spirit is strong in this one	i don't remember the last time there was truly blind hate on the front page. sometimes people tunnel on ONE stupid thing riot does, but it's nowhere as ridiculous as what they get praised for. it's like people think them adding AP to the rabadons tooltip, or making a summoner icon for christmas, or like i said the paper toy, is praiseworthy. the "thank you riot for your game" on thanksgiving or whatever is ok, but it's just funny when people grasp for straws for an excuse to praise them. give credit where credit is due, not where it's not. blind hate is directed on pro players usually.

16527	I'm certainly not going to discount the possibility...	So, for clarification, you think it may have been part of God's plan for us to sin, so that we could become more than we were made to be? If so, I'm inclined to agree.
16528	Business batman is all business.	Best Ad Placement I've Seen In A While. The Batsuit.
16529	thats just sad :(((	Yup.
16530	Of course they do, but when some religious nut bombs an abortion clinic, performs an honour killing or flies a plane into a building then it has nothing to do with their religion.	Conservapedia finds direct link between young mass murderers and video game playing, atheist liberals
16531	B-b-b-but FEMA camps!	Every time I read "police state" in the context of the United States, I want to punch whatever trust-fund anarchist wrote it. I emigrated from an actual police state. With labor camps and a one-party government and ethnic cleansing and censorship and state-sanctioned assassinations. America is anything but, you entitled asshole.
16532	No you cant not not hit a mine on the first shot	Cant you not hit a mine on the first shot?
16533	Erm, because feels?	Spot on. From a business perspective, why the fuck would anyone enter into a contract that the other party can terminate *at any time* and depart with a preponderance of *your* assets even if they *contributed nothing* at all?
16534	Yes, and the Christians who wear those What Would Jesus Do bracelets all think of themselves as Jesus as well.	I know he's making a comment on his footballing ability. He's comparing himself to one of the best players of all time who got away with smoking, and he's saying if it was fine for Zidane then it should be fine for him. Problem is that Wilshere isn't as good as Zidane, so he can't get away with it. I think you're the one over-complicating this mate.
16535	oh no, I understood, I just think that's a hilarious suggestion.	I don't know how to explain it any simpler for you. Sorry.
16536	He's being sarcastic.	You believe the jewish people have an historical right to Isreal?
16537	Yeah, reddit loves hating on that show but I think it's pretty fun.	Tosh.0 is entertaining too, it's just not intelligent, high-quality television.
16538	Well then, sure.	its not trolling this is real
16539	SCCM, vCenter, Lync 2013	Sysadmins, what is your favorite enterprise software or appliance product? By enterprise, I mean software that you pay for and feel that it is well worth the money. We have a lot of software, and I don't normally find any that are worth it. One exception is Tableau. This is a beautiful tool for displaying graphs and metrics. Another would be RubyMine for development.
16540	Yeah, and she got raped because she was wearing that dress, too.	He wouldn't have attacked anyone if Zimmerman hasn't followed him. Still zimmermans fault.
16541	Yeah, I can't believe that UNC was actually favored.	Since UNC was favored by 2, I'm gonna call this an upset. Duke looked so great tonight. They're nearly unstoppable with Kelly.
16542	Yeah, what an asshole.	Jerry Buss chose a really really bad time to die.
16543	See my reply to Geschan's comment just above yours.	What? I saw him commenting before, but never saw a reply like yours about him. Who is he supposed to be?
16544	So amazing to learn that carnivorous animals will eat flesh.	Yeah, dogs will totally eat people. It's seemingly hard to believe if you grow up in the US, since they **are** *man's best friend*, but yeah. They'll totally eat you given the chance. It's actually kind of interesting how common the domestication of dogs is in the world, considering.
16545	Dont think of them a slaves, they are "Freedom workers"	not for the slaves.
16546	Growing to?	I'm Growing to Despise Dr. Oz I started watching Dr. Oz's TV show in it's first season, and it seemed chock-a-block with solid information. I've had somewhat of a skeptical mind since I was about 18 (39 now), but for whatever reason, I seemed to have blinders on when it came to Dr. Oz at first. Then last year, when I had a physical with my GP, she noted that I was overweight, and recommended I go and get a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day, and I mentioned in passing "oh yeah, I've heard Dr. Oz say that.". This caused my doctor to give me a bit of a dirty look, along with a "yes, and now I'm saying it.". It bothered me a little that she would have that reaction, because she is a very patient, good-natured doctor with fantastic bedside manner and a well-respected clinic. Was she offended that I would bring up the advice of another doctor, or was her derision directed toward Dr. Oz himself? From that point, I started paying closer attention to what he said on his show. Perhaps coincidentally, or perhaps because I was actually listening, I began to notice things. Like how much homeopathic material was presented, like how expensive all the "superfoods" he was recommending are on supermarket shelves, like how he had John Edward on his show, and became "convinced" there was something to what he did. Yesterday, he had a debate in his studio about whether food is addictive. I had some problems with how he presented the debate, the main two are 1) a concensus on the definition of the word "addictive" was not established, and it was apparent by the fact that both parties seem to consider different definitions, and 2) Oz was acting as a moderator, but at the end of the segment it was obvious that he had his mind made up before the debate, and was giving advice about "addictive foods" by the end of the show. This man is a medical doctor! Aren't doctors supposed to be critical and science-minded? Does he actually think like this, or is the show presented to attract an uncritical, sheeplike audience? TL;DR: I used to respect Dr. Oz's opinion, but a talk with my own GP made me look at him more critically, and I no longer like or respect what I see.
16547	Because it's normalising the vile and reprehensible narrative that a girl doesn't owe her boyfriend sex.	I'm not surprised by the reaction at all. But I don't get why they all care so much.
16548	Gotta spend money to save money.	After you spend $100,000 on the car of course.
16549	Wait, so should I be shooting at 720p on the t3i?	News flash: the t3i isn't ever going to give you 1080P H264...even at Canon's "1080P" setting. The resolved image is much closer to 720P.
16550	Hopefully we'll buy another CDM instead of a CB this year and that will fix our problems.	Yeah I wasn't putting the blame on him, it's just shows that there are extremely evident problems with our defense that management needs to fix, instead of trying to buy Torres.
16551	It's silly because they can treat you like crap for free.	Last night, my customer insulted my appearance and then justified his comment by insisting that he will tip well. Why does the service industry make people think they can treat others like crap for a few extra bucks? I'm just wondering about other people's experiences and whether or not anyone thinks this system can be fixed or if it indicates a larger problem in human convention. Does the gift of empathy now come with a price tag? And whatever happened to the Golden Rule?
16552	If the Hipoint would have fallen apart, less lives would have been taken.	They had multiple weapons... Semi-auto "tec 9", Hipoint 995 carbine, one pump action shotgun, and one double barreled shotgun, both sawn down in size/length. Their lack of money and planning are a good reason more people didn't die.
16553	yea nice job!	New front door and tiled the small foyer. My pup also gave me a hand. What do you think?
16554	But dude, edgy is sooo funny	carlin and hicks are both terrible
16555	Should've used the	I was being sarcastic.
16556	you made it real obvious	No shit. It was rhetorical. As in "how could the Vikings give us all that"
16557	This only makes sense if you don't apply logic, stop doing that.	Oh there's so many levels of stupid here. First off does a hybrid naturally save gas over a conventional car? There are many 34MPG cars and there are 31MPG hybrids performance cars. Even if you do drive a 40MPG Civic that's a 6 MPG savings. The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon on gasoline that means that $100 tax equates to the tax someone would pay on 543.48 gallons of gas. The average person drives around 13,500 miles a year which at 34MPG would equate to around 400 miles. So a hybrid driver would have to pay a fine HIGHER than what a person driving 34MPG a year. And if it's a hybrid they'd still be paying gas taxes on the 340 gallons of gas that a 40MPG hybrid would consume. So they'd end up paying $162.50 for the combination of the $100/yr plus the normal gas tax. A 40MPG hybrid pays $10.95 less in gas tax than a 34MPG car. I'd also wager that the vast majority of plug-in electric drivers drive far fewer miles due to range concerns, and I have a feeling that the average miles driven by hybrid drivers might be a touch lower as some of the people who drive hybrids are the eco types who would walk or ride a bike when possible.
16558	No, I'm on an island, we have limited internet lol maybe not 3.7mbps but close	I thought BC was supposed to have relatively decent speeds available. Any chance you meant MBps?
16559	boomdingaling!	Really? A community-sourced paper? If Reddit was anything to go by it would be largely about homosexuality. Enjoy your fuck-fest gayboys!
16560	Super glad that I got excited about new Pokemon news.	GameFreak Says Pokemon Will Evolve In 2013
16561	Bartenders also call a bottle opener a "bar key".	I have honestly never heard it called a wine key. TIL
16562	But... but that's for losers!	Somebody tell him about prostitutes.
16563	Tried and realized they were a bunch of soulless, lazy, potato-eating drunkards.	Tried?
16564	Oh thank god, it would have been difficult for him to talk.	Jets receiver Santonio Holmes has X-Rays, does not have broken rib.
16565	What really stinks about these guards getting caught is that they have been warned over and over again about abusing prisoners in view of the cameras.	Cook County, IL Jail Guard Attack On Inmate Caught On Surveillance Video
16566	Your logic is flawless	This makes an interesting point. Do vegans still eat pussy, seeing as how they don't eat any animal byproducts whatsoever? I mean, pussy juice is from an animal: the human.. Jesus christ, vegans violate their principles on a daily basis I just realized. They drink their own spit, but they themselves are an animal!
16567	lol I have that.	Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings oh THAT bible
16568	Strange.. it's not blue :o	By going to the link that he posted.
16569	If you click my second link, you'll see he stated his intentions very clearly on Meet The Press last Sunday.	Suddenly, I care. Your link leads to more links where in various proposed legislation Santorum has fought against health of mother exceptions.
16570	Nope, the people hating on someone who's harmless and an easy target give America a bad name.	Oh god, shes American. Shes the kind of person that gives America a bad name.
16571	If we can make a chainsaw that runs on wood, the energy crisis would be over!	TIL that during and after WWII cars were converted to run on wood, and in 1989 FEMA published a book about how to return to the technology in case of disaster.
16572	Because that other guy was a much better choice.	Step aside and let the grownups clean up the mess you've gotten us into.
16573	They always looked like they'd have enough room to stuff a dead hooker up front and still be comfy, but I'm assuming the exterior of a vic is misleading.	I'm 6'5" and I'm a little tight but not terrible in a Charger. Crown Vics are awful though.
16574	They're just jealous of my obviously leet skillz.	cant believe all the hate you are getting. you cant catch a break!
16575	In what world do you live in where having 200 dollars saved up proves you're able to live on your own?	Well he doesn't *have* to. If he can afford a $200 dollar sword he could probably afford to move away from his brother. Alternatively, he could stab the kid. That would probably shut him up.
16576	Give it back!	No, that's not what he meant. He said it is *my right*.
16577	Tormund would say they found their "manhood"	Winter came and the guys all grew beards.
16578	Honestly it's will power and quitting cold turkey.	What is the best way to quit tobacco use? I've been trying to quit for a while and can't bring myself to do it. Any tips?
16579	Fundamentals of engineering exam.	what is the FE?
16580	Great, you've reduced his story down to a cheap bumper sticker for karma.	I'm convinced we hate our freedoms far more than the terrorists do.
16581	I am in the same boat my friend, by the time I take my phone out to read Reddit I already finished.	I shit about once every other day. I'm on the crapper for about 30 seconds tops when I do. Always perfectly clean, half the time when I wipe there isn't any crap. I also eat total shit. Monsanto probably fucking loves me.
16582	American here, I don't care how you spell it ... only that the 'Murican way is correct	We have a choice. To be laughed at by the Brits or the Americans.
16583	Fox News viewers will.	New GOP Slogan: Down With Greed! - Will voters buy the new Republican attacks?
16584	Too soon!	^^^^^and ^^^^^each ^^^^^other
16585	Dat dynamic range.	Oh god even people in the industry don't understand brightness and contrast well. Oh look, let's make it so black as to obliterate at least 50% of all tones the picture may have had, and make it look like everyone has snowblindness. People just don't get subtlety. It's the same shit with people who naturally set their equalizer settings to BASS BOOST OH YEAH MOTHER FUCKER! making it sound like you're listening to your music underwater.
16586	The government making you pay for a freely available and limitless resource on your own property is capitalism?	Yay capitalism!
16587	much more difficult to make, set up, and detonate a bomb than it is to walk into a public space and shoot people.	Not with an illegally obtained gun. Or a bomb. They didn't ban fertilizer after the Oklahoma City bombings.
16588	The problem is politicians redraw district lines to ensure their own re-elections.	Yet, America keeps reelecting incumbents. It topped 90% for both houses of Congress last year. That tells me the outrage is feigned or misdirected.
16589	It was taken just outside Waterloo station to be fair however I do see the point you're trying to make.	Because buses show where they are on the front of them rather than where they're going?
16590	Are you a cop?	Are you just spamming this link over and over?
16591	How about another first round pick?	We'll give you a 7th to take that scrub off your hands.
16592	it's sad half these comments below dont understand the post.	I think I'll be spending more time there now
16593	C'mon, this is worth your future.	Sorry I'm late to the party -- I'm a grad student and I'm swamped with assignments, so I can't watch it live today. That said... BROWNS!
16594	I just love how it is still so relavant...even over 10 years later.	One of my favorite little things from Transmetropolitan.
16595	*splash*	*harden*
16596	for Reggie Bush you need to get a WR1 who is producing right now as a WR1; Dez, Cruz, Marshall, Welker, etc.	Ok thanks! I'm sitting on 6 RB's (why...I'm not sure) so I feel like I should trade Bush (injury prone) while he's hot right now. Who is a good WR value for him?
16597	Maybe we have evolved a stronger control over our muscles which control movement whilst we haven't for stress sounds or maybe since we identify the sound we dont react that much.	So if we hear nails on the chalkboard why don't we run or move? Screaming in a primal sense I'm sure is caused from the presence of danger, no? Then I would feel that we would do more than cringing or covering our ears.
16598	Giant checks like any other big event/lottery LDO.	How do they pay you in the big tournaments? ive never played a huge tournament so I was wondering how they pay the winners. Ive always imagined just getting a shitload of cash from they, but i assume they give you a cheque or direct deposit?
16599	Spy-duh!	First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies Next, tell me what's always the last thing to mend, The middle of middle and end of the end? And finally give me the sound often heard During the search of a hard-to-find word. Now string them together, and answer me this, What creature would you be unwilling to kiss?
16600	This is a serious thing because you are setting an example.	I don't see how my abuse concerns anyone outside of who I mess around with which is only people I am friends with. If it was that big a deal it would have been dealt with long ago. It's not like it's a secret what I do.
16601	Destruction, Illusion and Conjuration.	Thanks! What about magic? Which do you think a vampire would likely use?
16602	The karma you missed out on	That's weird... When I was looking at these pictures, I literally said "That wallet looks sick!" And then I thought about how weird it was that I said sick. I never say that!
16603	You could have used a stomping grounds.	Paid roughly $500 for my alpha taiga that is in my belcher deck. Yes I could have bought the revised one, but I wanted the Alpha cause reasons.
16604	And the legislation takes laissez-faire to a whole new level.	Not exactly, more the I own a politician so I get the legislation I want types.
16605	It's a muppetish thing turning to look at the screen ^^or ^^is ^^it?	What is it? ^^^^^^Dragons?
16606	Don't be ridiculous, *modern* programmers wrap their serialised Java objects in JSON...	Surely you mean serialized Java objects in an xml wrapper?
16607	Laidtex (TM), a new fragrance from Axe/Lynx	After closely analyzing the video through various zoom-zoom-and-enhance style techniques that I won't get into (don't want to bore you) I have discovered that despite the myriad of other vaginas and bazonkas that are making their way to the rain-coated penis, the penis remains firmly engaged **only with the first vagina** that leapt upon him. In the end, the message is clear: though it is important to have only one partner at a time when using a condom, other women will be attracted to you once they see that you are obviously taking the proper precautions and will descend upon you to observe your gyrating capabilites mid-coitus, awaiting their turn, each with fresh condom in hand, dripping from their loins with anticipation. **tl;dr** if you wear a condom, within minutes a vagina (presumably attached to a woman) will begin humping your penis.
16608	It's almost like it's a movie or something.	This always annoyed me (Mission Impossible)
16609	Ah let the normal pickup truck circle jerk begin.	Asshole parking level 100
16610	it is actually just strange parts for the stranges you don't have now.	And by rare item, you mean a force-a-nature 90% of the time
16611	At least you got to see 'John from Cincinnati'	Fuck you man! You just had to go and bring all those horrible feelings back up! I thought I was over it...... I now know I'll never be over it..... :(
16612	Are.... are you female and you don't know what used tampons look like?	What the fuck is wrong with people...I've been out of high school for quite some time and I see this shit in women bathrooms so it's not just high school girls...just nasty people. Also...why is it yellowish and black!?
16613	I don't really think you understand what opinion means.	If it is my opinion I should get to bathe in your family's blood, am I right?
16614	Is that OP?	heh
16615	It's almost as if some teachers actually do know how to teach!	As someone who always read in class.... I never thought about it from that perspective. Makes certain teachers seem less ass-holey in hindsight.
16616	A guy with a gun in his pants in San Jose is normal, anyhow.	Its over now. And to think I'm a tall white guy in a black T shirt. Guess I'll be trying to not look sketchy today. In all seriousness they never found the guy, so things are back to normal.
16617	To any of you who actually believe that creationism is an accepted and frequently taught viewpoint in churches because you're too narrow-minded and caught up in the liberal form of learning that involves; "X (Government, media, celebrities, etc) said Y is this so that makes Y what X said" Go evolve into a more intelligent being.	If Only This Was True
16618	Hey unpopular opinion, but maybe Utah is pretty good I guess?	Yeah this was in no way an upset, no disrespect to UCLA, but Stanford had home field advantage and was still probably considered a slightly better team by Vegas.
16619	Absolutely, his achievements in each individual code are almost enough!	Would a win make Brad Thorn the most accomplished rugby player of all time?
16620	Except it's not alcohol, it's the blood of Christ	considering it's a part of Mass, it'd be weird if catholics started believing in prohibition.
16621	That would be racist.	why was he not in custody after violently and arbitrarily assaulting someone like that?
16622	Would like to see how people would react if the sexes were reversed, but we live in a patriarchy so it is okay	Boyfriend trainer. A nickelodeon game aimed at young girls.
16623	It's a good thing the WWE always gives things to people who deserve it and bust their asses for the company then.	Hopefully not. There are far more deserving men on the card who have been working hard every week on TV and house shows.
16624	What rules am I making up?	Now you're just making up universal rules for buildings. Shut the hell up you lying asshole. :) Feels so good to be able to say that without being moderated on the forum I normally argue with you people on.
16625	but but..she did them herself, so that's like, original and so edgy!	Those make jail tattoos look like fine art
16626	But it's still a virus!	Not scientific? Antibiotic resistance and the viral mutation that causes a need for a yearly flu vaccine are *perfect* scientific evidence of evolution. It's actually one of the best answers to the claim that the theory of evolution is not predictive and is therefore bad science; we can predict that the organism will evolve, *and* the direction in which it will evolve (toward resistance), sufficiently answering the stupid claim to the contrary.
16627	Wow, I totally didn't see that coming	UPass Compass Cards delayed until 2014
16628	They just keep having a rough time, perhaps they should invest a little more in safety testing.	Toyota recalling 680,000 vehicles
16629	Not in California	Yes, cause wildfires almost never happen in the summer......
16630	Only Christians can criticize Christianity, its so simple guys.	Fox News wrote an opinion piece on how the media is wrongly targeting them because of the Reza Aslan interview. What they took from the criticism is that people are defending islam and attaching Christianity.
16631	What are you trying to say...	Is family guy the one about the stupid fat guy that marries a hot wife has a son and a daughter as well as a baby?
16632	the team of the two interviewed guys didn't make it to the group stage in a previous tournament.	He was talking about how they didn't do groups or something and the guy just cut in to agree.
16633	Yeah it's been a nightmare for us.	really good read; suspected as much. I thought the idea of 'co-captains' (Grimes, Trengove) was a farce when I heard about it, the player group needs to pick one guy to help them start down a road where they play for each other and develop their own culture of success.
16634	He was totally right about Joker....	I took a screenshot of this so that I can post it when the Heat win this series.
16635	Don't worry, Wizards of the Coast just released Modern Masters to make it easier to get into that format	"some"
16636	Yeah, I'm sure her and her gay hairdressing husband have their evil plan against all the menz figured out to a tee, glad we've got you to warn us about these heinous evils.	Julia Gillard has declared a gender war on men, with her false accusations of misogyny and her attack on guys in blue ties. Men are starting to notice. Why should we vote for a party that hates us?
16637	Yes... because those T3 Cruisers balanced EVERYTHING.	tl;dr CCP spent too long focusing too much on their walking in stations stuff, neglecting the main game, and when it came to their summer expansion, they had almost nothing finished, but delivered it with all the fanfare they could muster. Players WTF'd, quit in hoardes. CCP fired a shit load of people and apologised, EVE is back on track as a spaceships game. The Incarna stuff should've been a cool addition to the game, but it shouldn't have come at the cost of maintaining the core gameplay.
16638	Ya, why can't they be like us intellectual redditors?	Anyone who uses a 'hashtag' can go fuck themselves.
16639	You will be missed, Randy.	"Why I am done with the web."
16640	Seriously, what a quitter	If I hear one more goddammed thing about Cam's head and a towel...
16641	But all the people who crash and are injured/killed when you deploy spike strips against them, those people deserve it right?	My uncle was struck by a fleeing vehicle a year ago while throwing spike strips. My father and I realized we had the opportunity to save lives.
16642	It would be the perfect plot for season 8!	President... whatever his name is was only in his first term, no? Frank would have to wait until 2020.
16643	He's into bdsm too if that's your thing	I see a lot of GD, TOP, and Taeyang on here, but where's the love for Seungri?
16644	Brah just move to section 8 housing and live with 4 other room mates stop complaining this is America, the greatest nation	The illegal immigrants are all living in houses with like 50 roommates, illegally. A lot of them with family members too. What are you talking about? I don't know any illegal immigrants that are living in a nice apartment and able to browse the internet at their leisure.
16645	Yeah, the internet is totally going to do this.	Anonymous calls for internet blackout to protest CISPA
16646	10k here 10k there before long you're talking about real money.	100k over 10 years. 10k a year isnt a lot so I wouldnt really be up in arms over it
16647	Wait I thought the seahawks invented the 12th man.	Well, LA Rams - Look's like we're going to have a dance-off! "Thanks 12th man!" - 1986 Redskins
16648	I read through that, then started seeing all the facts as TILs and downvoted them all.	TIL about the IMDB trivia page for Arrested Development.
16649	*shhhh* you're not being open minded enough for reddit	I'd like to ask the 2 people who just downvoted me if they honestly think that having sexual contact with a dog is NOT off limits.
16650	Vanguard Bandits for PS and Magician Lord for Neo*Geo (also on PSN) Bother great games imo, that are rarely ever mentioned or brought up nowadays.	What's one game that wasn't popular amongst the gaming community or even remarked as bad but you played the hell out of it and couldn't let it down? Why? Just 1 of mine among many other titles would have to be The Simpson's Road Rage (basically like Crazy Taxi with free roam environments of different sections of the city of Springfield. Had a HUGE cast of characters to pick from the show and all of em had personalized vehicles they drove). Being a Simpsons fan, I loved getting to drive around Springfield, seeing all the landmarks, laughing at all the personal comments and conversations everyone had. All the voices were there saying trademark punchlines. It had races, multiplayer, timed taxi run, and so many Easter eggs.
16651	My grandmother calls black people 'niggers'	My Grandpa calls those little adhesive stickers for reinforcing notebook paper "Sailor's Buttholes." What alternative names do you guys have/have you heard for items?
16652	The obvious solution here is to use a better laser (eye-safety be damned).	Every time somebody reposts those "laser lane" rear lights, link them this video...
16653	No worries Ehnsaji, we're here to play cricket anyway.	Pakistan Taliban vow to attack Indian targets over Kasab
16654	OH BOY ANOTHER REFERENCE I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND	This your only form of I.D.?
16655	Chief Keef	Know any good rappers that don't curse? My 15 year old cousin wants a rap album so I was just wondering if you guys knew any rap artists that our moms would not mind him listening to. Thanks in advance!
16656	Nothing like church to autofilter those with the most pent up sexual frustration	Maybe he just wants to pick up some church babes.
16657	scroll to the bottom, I put graphics only that doesnt have any of the armors and what not, its just my graphics mods	I really wish someone would just put together a good visual/audio overhaul pack instead of including dumb stuff like baratheon armor and other non-digetic things.
16658	Thank you for your erudite contribution.	No, you're both putting forth nothing of actual substance and taking things way out of context with hyperbole.
16659	So is eugenics the answer?	TIL There was an experiment with overpopulation in an utopia with mice. Social decline, cannibalism, and violence ensues
16660	Oh good, another two WASPs for office.	They've got my vote this year!
16661		And thus an universal sarcasm indicator is born.
16662	as long as its a govt that does the killing, its fine by me!	This man isn't being discriminated against. It isn't a human right to traffic illegal narcotics. It its within the rights of a nation to draft its own legislation regarding drugs. You could try from the angle of right-to-life, but that's awfully hard if your nation still has the death penalty. The man willingly chose to do something illegal in a country he knew punished it with death. He's an idiot who fucked himself. I don't think he deserves to die, but I don't think anyone is obligated to help him out of a whole he dug himself.
16663	What a healthy, creative and friendly environment for children to develop their minds and self-improve!	Uncompromising Photos Expose Juvenile Detention in America
16664	Still the funniest thing on SNL...	Tim Tebow + David Bowie = Hilarity (Jimmy Fallon)
16665	"Don't be bad" - Best advice for all new players	Don't be bad or you will get raged at.... hard sometimes XD
16666	Why else are you on Reddit?	Yeah, you're right. I need a bunch of strangers on the internet to validate me or I get real depressed. You caught me.
16667	Wages are higher because everything in australia is trying to kill you	20.00 AUD = 18.80 USD Australian money is'int really the problem it's the cost of everything.
16668	I guess in the finished game it will do something!	That's sad... i was really excited :(
16669	i think you doubled a word you	What comes up, must come down.
16670	Thats all a pile of **shit**	BELIEVE IT OR NOT BY BAYLA1234 ITS TRUE. CHINA IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING HUMAN FECES INTO STEAK! I KIDD YOU NOT! BAY BAY.
16671	I feel like I have learned too much today about fetishes	This is an actual fetish. Once again, people pushing fetishes on one another.
16672	Yeah, but the ones they own are open 24/7.	Most of the stores for rich folks stayed close on Black Friday.
16673	I don't know the time, sorry.	You may want to link the actual time and not the WHOLE 50 minute video.
16674	nah, i had checked only 23.7 years ago and it was still broken.	Happened a little while ago buddy.
16675	I am not a marxist, I live in Canada and whatever you think I am trying to win has already been won here.	And it seems you are a cultural marxist so likewise. You will lose and Europe will be free.
16676	Bigger screen/variety of sizes, physical keyboard, LTE.	And what exactly does any android device have over iOS? (and don't say lack of polish and style b/c that's just universally known)
16677	That won't be a problem as soon as we abolish net neutrality.	The only reason we ever had a moral high ground is because secrets were easier to keep in the past.
16678	RTFA	I'm not up to date with Hitchens' writings. A couple of quick examples?
16679	If this was a story about a woman suddenly sticking her finger up a mans hoop because she misunderstood how a butthole works I am sure there would be a similar reaction :)	Making fun of a man's sexual incompetence? Thats fun, lots of fun...I sure would love to see the reaction if the genders were switched.
16680	Is that what happened to his hair?	TIL James Taylor's song "Fire and Rain" referred to him being in a mental institution and receiving shock therapy.
16681	lol	First time I have seen a plain "LOL" get ANY upvotes.
16682	He's not an actual superhero so much as an ad campaign for Combo snacks.	dear god i did not know such a super hero existed.
16683	I never said it was malicious; I'm just pointing out the flaw in your reasoning.	Actually, it's more of a tautology; it's not begging the question at all. Look, this was just a miscommunication. You make it seem as if I was maliciously trying to pull a fast one here or something. I only ever meant that when infallibility is invoked, the teaching cannot change.
16684	actually it's not, the picture is dota related obviously since it's CM.	pretty sure that these posts were the ones that were supposed to be weeded out of this subreddit, not sure how that has anything to do with dota.
16685	What texture pack is this?	Contrary to popular opinion, pigs get lonely too
16686	Islam did not inherit the mantle of Christianity.	That explains Islam.
16687	Oh... I'm in row 2.	Sec 333. I'll have to swing by and say hi. :)
16688	I think OP's point is that gimmicky new things, while not necessarily bad in themselves, should not be wedged in at the expense of getting the basics right.	yes new things are bad, lets be conservative and throw all innovation in to the hate truck. young people these days with their improved technology.
16689	If firaxis can find speakers of ancient Assyrian and Aztec for civ v, surely Hi-rez can get their hands on a Chinese person.	Chinese God's names. With Smite's renewed interest on the Chinese pantheons, i thought i would share some of my 2 cents regarding them. One thing that irks me terribly is the pronunciation of the chinese god's names. After watching the Zhong Kui spotlight and listening to the narrator's pronunciation, i thought it best to bring this point up. Even though most people wouldn't care, i just wanted to bring this up. I know its difficult to pronounce chinese words without learning the HanYu PinYin phonetic system, but isn't it simple for Hi-rez to ask a chinese friend or a teacher for the voice actors to learn the pronunciations from? I found myself laughing when the Jade Rabbit couldn't even pronounce Chang'e's name properly, and He Bo keeps referring to himself inaccurately. He Bo sounds more like Her Ber-wor; Guan Yu's "Yu" is difficult to transcribe without its phonetics, but it's not pronounced as "You". Chang'e is also difficult to transcribe, but it DEFINITELY isn't pronounced so aggressively like how the jade rabbit says it(CHANGGRER).It's much softer and elegant. Ao Kwang and Ne Zha is pretty much the same, except for the difference in phonetics. Zhong Kui's voice actor got his name pretty much right. The spotlight narrator's pronunciation is a different story though. As an ethnic Chinese, playing as the characters of stories i grew up with is cool; Hi-Rez did a fantastic job at translating their unique visual styles and characteristics (except old Sun Wukong, that was terrible). Just wanted to voice out this pet-peeve of mine, so that the eventual players from China wouldn't laugh themselves out at the translations.
16690	So privacy for little girls don't exist in your world?	I am rather sure that before you can sexually harass someone who have to be old enough to know what sex is. The article sounds to me like kids being kids. Of course the young boy didn't stop the first time he was told. They never do. Additionally if the school thinks that suspension will somehow stop this I question if those in charge have ever dealt with children.
16691	No, because he's not criticizing scrolling itself.	Anyone else find irony in the fact that the writer is criticizing scrolling, while constraining his own site to 400px and forcing the content to stack and push well below the fold, when it doesn't supposedly *need* to? UI designers.... *sigh*
16692	I won't report you if you give me a key	Two hearthstone keys to giveaway! :D
16693	Imgur needs us but we don't need Imgur.	When I learned "Imgurians" hate redditors.
16694	.....Congressional medal of trolling ?	A lot of people get trolled. But this woman trolled her husband on the board he *moderates.* Give her a medal.
16695	you are absolutely right i spend as much time going over word usage and spelling in an online forum talking to strangers as i do on my resume.	You here nothing? Maybe you're resume needs work. Brush up on capitalization, homophones, and word usage. You might here something after that.
16696	Oh, Banndit, you are the *living end*!	Never noticed the Christmas light nipples.
16697	Wait, I thought the party line was something like: If they do that then they are not REAL Christians.	They terrorize Africa, kidnapping children and turning them into soldiers and sex slaves, murdering, raping, mutilating... But Rush Limbaugh defends them because they're Christians.
16698	Then move insurance away from employment toward individual and make it more like term life insurance.	The old way was far more complicated. Do you have a pre-existing condition? Maybe, maybe not. What if you don't tell the insurance company about it. Now you're in limbo if you get seriously sick. It's up to lawyers to fight about whether or not your cancer was pre-existing, and if you're drawing big treatment dollars, more lawyers are working to figure it out. And what if you're drawing big treatment dollars and they find out you had some *other* pre-existing conditions (treated for acne at 16...that's a pre-existing condition). You can be dropped for that, even though you need treatment for something totally unrelated. That's far more complicated and requires lawyers. There were loopholes before, too, and you could make a solid argument that they were even more severe.
16699	Male privilege	Sacrifice
16700	Akali's not bad because of her shroud, I'd put her mid tier in terms of 1v2	Best 1v2 Champions? I'm just starting to cross into the level of play where Junglers are more common, which I've really been looking forward to. However, since not ALL teams at this level have a jungler, I'm often left on teams where my team has a jungler, but the other team does not resulting in a 1v2 top lane, which gets absolutely crushed. What are some good champions to fend off 2 opponents long enough to get through the laning phase? Also, are there any good strategies for being the team without the jungler? I often get teams where nobody wants to jungle and nobody wants to risk taking a 1v2 lane so that I can jungle.
16701	Cowboys are land pirates.	I would eat a kitten to see this happen. Hell, two kittens.
16702	Tell them I'm Mormon, close the door, and realize that's going to be me in a few short months.	What is your usual approach when dealing with Jehovah's witnesses?

16705	So Ghanian-African-American.	But they're not American, the Ghanaian
16706	Your baby sounds like an asshole!	my ex gf was mad at me because our 4 month old baby cried sometimes when she was holding her and she didn't cry when i hold her. =/
16707	unless it's pee or he spit in it!	See, not everyone over there is an asshole.
16708	Cocaine.	What makes you better?
16709	That's quite a strong opinion.	TB is such a cunt.
16710	This right here is why I hate most Reddit users, this ad is supporting the website you love so much but all you do is bitch.	Because FREE Watch?
16711	think of the handjobs you'd give!	My mother told me not to strength train as a girl because "With the way you're built, you'll bulk up and look like a Russian farmworker!"
16712	Thank you CUNT-THRUSTING!	I WISH!
16713	Yes, because everyone has a phone with wifi capability.	LPT - If your power is out and want to confirm that others are also without power, use the Wi-Fi on your phone to browse for access points If no access points are found where you typically see them, it is safe to assume that others have also lost power.
16714	oh yea their vegan selection is superb	sorry that i go to trader joe's fams I know certain members of the hiphop community don't think it's trill enough but I got a pretty dank ass curry from there so #yolo i guess! (drake is so fuckin soft lolllll) :*D*

16719	This doesn't seem like a military coup *at all*...	At least 20 killed after Egyptian Military opens fire on Pro-Morsi demonstrators
16720	But our may-mays, they listen to our may-mays.	Yeah, because talking on Reddit will solve it.
16721	Not fair, you forgot the third thing they are doing to make it all better, removing child labor laws.	interestingly, republicans are working hard to remove the minimum wage as well as get rid of abortion clinics
16722	and around her arms and legs, with chain wrapped around her body.. All we'd need are a couple condoms and a plastic bag for disposal.	Blind fold on, ear plugs in, just missing some duct tape over her mouth.
16723	she must be balling her eyes out.	"I find unintellegence a turn off"
16724	Then give up	Fighting fire with marshmallows
16725	yeah its not like Hitler tried to outright overthrow the government all at once.....its not like he published a book outlining the building of a dictatorship and advocating persecution of minorities while he was in prison for a failed violent coup...... yup, just like obama.	Exactly. People act like Germany just woke up under the third reich. Like it wasn't a slow contiguous usurpation of rights and authority.
16726	Aww, I thought you were serious until you said you were kidding	Since they can't see or hear how much poop there is on the paper, they have to lick the paper to make sure your butt is clean after. You don't want to taste your own feces, so they wipe more than enough to get the clean lick on the first try (I'm kidding)
16727	Yes, because I'm sure there are heaps of those.	I think this might be designed to encourage those who fill out x number of job applications for no matter what job each week so they can stay on the dole.
16728	Well duh, he didn't even know how to spell dentist!	A shop front in Mogadishu, Somalia. Illiteracy rates are so high, many business owners paint bright pictures on the wall to advertise the service they offer.
16729	You'd catch more if you used high end pensions.	Bait the cops
16730	Context?	His best friend left today. Not sure if they will ever see each other again.
16731	Yes because all white people were racist.	Black people hating white people was pretty justified during most of America's history.
16732	[I felt bad when I won Whiterun as a Stormcloak; Jarl Balgruuf The Greater really makes you feel bad when you best him. ]	I always tend to play as a Khajiit or an Argonian. The choice was kinda simple for me. Also, I quite like Whiterun.
16733	I had to quit when the live band started	YouTube comedy live, tune in now and watch the cringe roll
16734	This is definitely downvote worthy.	I was unaware of that, I use alien blue and reddit pics for the iPhone. No double comments yet I'm proud to say ^_^
16735	Guys can't be raped, they should be grateful for any sex they get.	I've seen girls fall down drunk but these girls are insane. They basicly planned rape.
16736	After watching that mermaid spoof on Animal planet I have deemed this proof that apes evolved into mermaids.	Summertime
16737	Guise John Terry is white and English but since Suarez is foreign the FA treated him unfairly	Fair? Terry vs Suarez. Do I need to say more?
16738	I think he means the shadows on their forehead.	This isn't foreshadowing. At all.
16739	I for one will boycott KH and all SE games for supporting M$ Xbone.	Kingdom Hearts 3 also on Xbox One? It would appear so. Thoughts?
16740	Eshays bruz!	Those are still commonplace as fashion statements with the kids-young adults growing up in the lower income areas of Australia. I make a joke of rocking one for a couple of days whenever I get my hair cut.
16741	All them damn illegal immigrants, go home.	Colorado SUCKS!!!
16742	Well this is new information.	TIL that Zuko was originally going to be Katara's love interest.
16743	Being a guy is such a 21^st century choice.	And a guy.
16744	I, too, hate people who wish to make a positive impact on the world and a family, I will downvote this man accordingly.	I want to impact the world in some sort of meaningful way that will have a positive effect even after I've died. Not sure how, yet. And I would like a family one day too. I don't think the second question applies to me.
16745	Let us all of a moment of silence for those poor bourgeois reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries that Stalin *brutally* oppressed...	Also...killing between 200,000 and 700,000 is still horrific. Criminals or otherwise.
16746	I'm sure France, GB, and the USA are doing all this to make the world a happier place for everyone to live in.	^^I ^^think ^^that ^^destroying ^^violent ^^islam ^^is ^^important ^^and ^^that ^^saving ^^northern ^^mali ^^from ^^sharia ^^law ^^is ^^a ^^good ^^thing. ^don't ^hurt ^me
16747	Oh yes, because manipulating the memory and feelings of a lost loved-one for profit is fine as long as you make them feel good...	Watched this last night and I can't recall precisely... but Alex's reaction was more that she now "understood", not so much "believed". She saw the comfort that the superstitious beliefs were bringing her Aunt and decided to bite her tongue rather than call them out. A mature acknowledgment that not every situation is the right time for that sort of thing.
16748	Maybe even slow-motion!	I would like to know this as well. Is this running in real time or sped up?
16749	This works well when you have Type A managers and Type B employees...	One of the world's largest technology companies has taken the extraordinary step of banning working from home as concerns that telecommuting prevents interacting with their coworkers.
16750	Are you an Alyoshav bot?	iOS delenda est.
16751	What am I, a *nerd*?	Rss is pretty good.
16752	Yeah, cuz only only black people think you are a loser.	OH FUCK MAN YOU REALLY GOT ME THERE! I couldn't be more surprised that an Africoon couldn't come up with his own original thought.
16753	Nah, every girl is the same and they all like the same things.	Some girls just don't like it, they cant get over it by no fault of their own.
16754	I'm *shocked* that now that there's no chance of a Conservative being the Republican nominee they just fold up their table and leave.	Third party group gives up seeking a candidate
16755	All the way down.	How do we feel about turtles?
16756	They had to make sure it wasn't the guy, I mean really sure..	Black man jailed for nearly a year in rape that alleged victim recanted the day after making accusation
16757	But, but... but Russo thought it was a genius idea and there were FIFTEEN other people who thought the same!	you can name as many as you want to, but only one is needed to shut any defense down......David Arquette Wins wCw World Heavyweight Championship 4/26/00
16758	We are better then them as we are taught to turn the other cheek, that's why it's ok to kill them.	How I feel about politics and Christianity...
16759	the negative karma people are the BEST	:)
16760	The thing is that this footage will most likely not seen by a majority of Americans.	hmm, honestly i think that this non violent approach, recorded and forced out into the media-vers as much as possible is the best approach. because watching footage like this is impossible to find good or healthy or just. it's just wrong, and honestly takes just as much strength, fortitude, courage, as physically fighting back. just as much courage, if not more because you're putting your life on the line for everyone and leaving yourself entirely vulnerable, not even defending yourself. it gives the oppressor 0 ground to stand on. our biggest problem today, i think, as this guardian post shows, is subverting our corrupt national media's unjust goals and making sure this is seen by all citizens. simply because it should. anything less is criminally irresponsible of journalists, or i'm sad to say what generally passes for them in this country today "First they ignore you, Then they ridicule you, Then they fight you, Then you win." - Ghandi
16761	I dunno, he seems legit.	You keep talking, and yet you've got nothing to say. Fascinating.
16762	I especially like the plastic feathers on the shoulders	I may be going against the general circlejerk here but those are sexy. I like the base layers/undershirts the most.
16763	Because men are obviously ALWAYS aroused when they have an erection.	I think you may be mistaken about what hard nipples mean. They aren't the female version of an erection.
16764	That's why you bury them out back!	It is legal in most states to shoot someone who breaks into your home.
16765	There's been absolutely nothing of note for them to report on recently	What happened to yognews? I really liked those.
16766	G'day, old bean.	Yes, I said that in a jokingly way. Anyways, everyone is entitled to their own opinion so have a good day, sir.
16767	that's the problem though, people are all "i figured they've been doing this for years" and are ok with it	Something like this would be a good start, but personally I don't think there is enough public pressure for this to happen, as it is inevitably going to be highly damaging for the government. The (perhaps surprising) level of support for the Amash amendment means that maybe this is going to be taken seriously enough for something to happen, if the headlines continue and enough people are motivated enough to apply pressure to their representatives.
16768	a decentralized facebook running on people's computers so that people can keep their private data.	What's your stupid, unrealistic app idea? I want an app that can tell me how many photos on the internet I appear in the background of.
16769	you obviously dont read as many threads as I do	Saying it has the strongest lineup of games or calling it the most enticing console this year =/= saying it will outsell the others. Neither does saying it has a chance to shine, or saying that the PS4's day one sales haven't guaranteed Sony lifetime dominance. Saying that the WiiU is in place for a comeback isn't the same as saying it will "win." Very few Nintendo fans on these subs talk about Nintendo winning this gen.
16770	CONGRATUFUCKINGLATIONS	So my friend signed up as an organ donor today.
16771	What's your fucking problem if I do get to?	What's your fucking problem? So you don't get to fap to a humiliated woman, boo fucking hoo.
16772	I felt like if I were to take this to any of the apple stores I have been to they would ask my why I own a Zune, if they even noticed me.	Brought an old toy to test something at the apple store today. The employes went crazy
16773	Are you saying verified and scientific studies that PROVE what I I'm saying is right is not PROOF?	that is not how proof works
16774	The race probably uses a ton less fuel that it took for 200,000 people to drive there.	Does anyone else think that the amount of petrochemicals used in a sport like NASCAR is fucking atrocious? And if so, why, and if not, why not? And having jet-fueled track dryers seems like the definition of waste. Thoughts?
16775	And, just like when you left, still no stealth rework yet.	6 months.. quite a while these are the MAJOR changes imo - visual overhaul - several new champions, the most notable are nautilus (jungler) and darius (top) - new items: maw of malmortius, athene's unholy grail, locket of iron solari - lifesteal on several items nerfed - deathfire grasp, morello's evil tome, zeke's herald changed - shen reworked - jax reworked - ryze reworked slightly
16776	but we are talking about detroit here...	The 'art' in this instance would be a 'bad frat prank' in any other city.
16777	Ill allow it	Oh... i was going to say, that this Wilson would have no problem looking over the fence... but now you ruined the joke.
16778	Friendship and murder is magical.	I'm no brony, but I can appreciate the irony on sticking the characters of a show, of which the primary message is "peace" or some shit, on a big fuck-off sword.
16779	I'll start working on that right away.	Quit being a fag and own up to your posts like me
16780	&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;	Adorable, but I couldn't help laughing at the "1337" at the top.
16781	Well, I'm also trying to change that too, but I'm a bit of a neophyte compared to the rest of the mods.	r/politics is all too often devoid of politics...
16782	Yup, just you.	Am I the only one for whom it exceeded all expectations?
16783	I'm fairly certain that being a Raiders fan is synonymous with having a criminal record.	Something I've always wondered regarding Niners fans and the Raiders I'm from the East Bay, and I've been a 49ers fan my entire life. That being said, I can't find it in me to have a good reason to actually dislike the Raiders. The way I see it: we very rarely play each other, and it's not like they've ever been someone we've been competing with for a division. So why is it so many 49ers fans vehemently dislike the Raiders (and vice versa)? Maybe I'm just too nice or something. I do hate the Rams, so it's not like I just don't hate anyone.
16784	I think that's fairly obvious given who they give it to.	Interesting link, but take it with the world's largest grain of salt. The organization that gives it, the National Council of Teachers of English, is a pro-union (and therefore more liberal) organization.
16785	I get free extras easier :3 Besides nurgle and tzeentch dont mind miscasts	It picks up miscasts better.

16788	3:05 oh god stop that	Girl desperate to get Eminem to visit Romania. So cringe it hurts!
16789	That's why I vote for the NDP, they offer an alternative...	yeah right because the big 5,6 parties are any different when it comes to surveillance. truth is they are the same once in power as the past shows. it's embarrassing to watch this propaganda ping pong being so efficiently manipulating people.
16790	Show me your tits	These comments are fucking awful. Everything from fake geek girl to attention whore to show me your tits. Reddit never disappoints.
16791	"We were just better than the Cowboys today" What a dick.	Like...?
16792	Really good, she smells nice and is a good hugger :) I should have gone for the kiss, however	How was the hug?
16793	Maybe it will instill a strong ~~work ethic~~ desire to make themselves wealthy.	Except that from now on every time you take them on a plane they'll wonder "Why aren't we sitting in the nice seats?"
16794	The Sun is better, it even gives the moon its light	I mean, redditors will argue about anything; What is better the sun or the moon? People who whistle at work are obviously morons! Lets argue about what dictionary defines this word more to my liking And now this gem, lol
16795	Because it worked out so well for those guys.	its depressing to see a kickass movie line get shit on by this asshole. pun intended. "im sorry" WTFuck.
16796	He was letting it hang and the toilet just pulls it out of his ass... you just don't have the skill and style he does.	Why does it sound like he's still pinching one off as the toilet is flushing? Dude that's not how you do it.
16797	The piece of paper is only worth what you put into it and what you can prove you are able to do.	The piece of paper that says you've got the degree is worth a lot in terms of employability.
16798	Yeah he did a great job of taking it too	Maybe you had gold he wanted?
16799	Does anyone else think this is tacky as shit?	Thanks to Reddit, I now have an awesome loft full of some sweet avenger night lites!
16800	No bro, this is real lyfe	You don't think that such media constructs its own *narratives* in order to bolster itself? I remember the interview with Jordan. He made clear that he held both Kobe and LBJ in extremely high regard. Yet we ignore the context and only hear about his hierarchical stance concerning the two.
16801	huh	Chronic masturbation is bad for you, for example. I've been able to observe the effects that masturbating upwards of 14 times a day has on your mental state. And plus orgasms just start to suck. Dick starts to get bruised and scabbed... And you get addicted. You will start to masturbate out of habit, not horniness. To me, "lessfap" is a lot harder than "nofap". If I masturbate once a day, it's harder not to go a second, a third, a fourth time. If I masturbate no times a day, it's easy to keep that streak going, until I start getting erections from the mere rub of my shorts and then I have to just_masturbate.
16802	I dislike those casters.	MegaZero's fakeout flash juke in today's WPC winner's finals.

16807	Yeah guys, this doesn't get posted enough!	The only thing missing from X/Y.
16808	I usually find those movies hacky but I can give that one credit for legit jump-scares and a good job keeping the story together.	I noticed he was good in that when I wasn't busy shitting my pants.
16809	I don't know, I found his economic theories quite applicable to government policy.	Milton Keynes - so. many. roundabouts.
16810	He already said he *doesn't* have a deep shrink issue.	Given your wealth, have you considered seeking therapy?
16811	After all, if they are not hiding something, what do they have to fear?	When you are living off of someone else's money, you are not not free.
16812	Totally the same as MSNBC!	Fox News: Al Jazeera America Is A Plot To Activate Muslim Sleeper Cells In Detroit
16813	I'd say Jack Russell and some other breed, but dominate is the Jack Russell part.	No fekin clue.
16814	You drive pretty well for an Asian.	What are some of the best backhanded compliments you know of. A coworker and I were talking about it and wanted to know.
16815	Naturally, the US was founded as a Christian country, breaking away from the heathen and secular British.	Does this seem inappropriate to anyone else? "float" in local parade for the fourth of July.
16816	Uther the lightbringer warcraft series, I'm a suckerfor the cliche honor duty respect characters.	Who is your favorite video game character of all time? Has there been a character in a game that's made a difference in your life? Maybe one that you've gotten attached to over the years, or one that didn't get enough appreciation?
16817	I should add, there's also nothing like a nice customer who makes it easy to say "Not our problem, but here's some freebies anyway."	Man, ain't nothing like saying "Not our problem, no freebies for you."
16818	Pretty much the only feature I miss from my old BlackBerry.	A notification led is the best feature that every other manufacturer ignores for no reason.
16819	Yeah the helicopter dick is always a real creative one	This as nothing to do with the thread but the creativity and randomness behind this comment was itself so hypnotizing that I had to upboat.
16820	Thank you :) I spent a lot of time putting this together	This is a perfect build, can't see anything to change.
16821	Dont tell me you bought an alienware haha	I ran PS2 off a ramdrive a couple times and it oddly smoothed by FPS out almost flatline, which was a total surprise. My rig is the best you can buy and there's always some variance in FPS jumping around. That ramdrive though... really brought some unexpected results.
16822	that whole combination of church and state is really working well for Egypt right now.	That's an extremely cynical view, and undoubtedly true in many, if not most, cases. It is not, however, universally true. People actually have ideals and believe it or not but in some countries idealistic people actually get elected.
16823	I call bullshit.	It's worth at least looking. A couple of my friends are going to be making over 5K a month at their internships this summer (going into senior year of college). Depends on the job/company though, I guess.
16824	Yeah, everybody knows men have no standards and will fuck literally anybody that shows interest.	No no, it doesnt matter... If he is willing to hang out, he's willing to bump uglies, as it were.
16825	It's all just a bet with Luiz, whoever has the least fans wearing a mask or afro, JT sleeps with his missus	Torres... will his nose ever heal?
16826	It also ruins the game with that fat stack of souls	So 2 of the same boss soul makes you a hacker? I don't think you know what hacking is.
16827	They just don't want to spoil it for you.	I also hate it when someone comments with the link to a picture first and put NSFW at the bottom of the comment box.
16828	Yeah but you forget, Judaism = Good, Islam = Bad.	It blows my mind that everyone is all up in arms about Shariah when an equivalent is literally in full effect in parts of the US.
16829	Oh yeah, you fit very well in the "not-asshole" department.	Aww, is the little angsty teenager upset? Oh dear, I'm sorry little man, I didn't mean to upset you, just to point out why most people on this site have a problem with this sub. Dry the tears and cheer up, there's a good lad.
16830	You're right, what ever was I thinking.	You're kinda gullible.
16831	True, but that doesn't discount the fact that all these stories are from Florida.	But in fairness, it's also a HUGE state. Part of the reason so many of the crazies come from florida is that so many of the everybodies come from florida. There just aren't enough people in rhode island, say, to leave room for face-eating cannibals.
16832	It seems that it would be a lot of the GOVERNMENT that would be killed.	so kill them with no fair trial? Would you really be willing to give the government that kind of power? Well, having an extension of that power?
16833	What more can you expect from a Russian Commie Professor of "Sciences" Jew?	Have you read Asimov's Guide To The Bible? It's brilliant. He treats it purely as a secular historic text, and doesn't really try to address any supernatural claims (he does, and there are some slightly snarky shots in there, but that's all part of the fun). Anyway, reading the bible as a historic text is actually really interesting. Stuff like Noah's story being a retelling of Gilgamesh, Samson and Delilah likely being related to sun worship due to the Hebrew names being similar to the words for sun and night, or even how the bible is actually a grouping of several different texts (which is why there are two different creations, two different lengths for the great flood, etc.). I mean it's all too easy to cherry pick quotes out of the bible, but reading Asimov's book you really get a proper understanding on how all the bullshit came about. I thoroughly recommend it, anyway.
16834	Yes, but are you a mod?	By a redditor for reddit. I'd appreciate your Feedback!
16835	flannel shirts and combat boots right that's what being a lesbian is right?	I feel like maybe he doesn't understand what being a lesbian is all about.
16836	Sorry I forgot Occupy owns all the rights to that term and the concept associated with it.	Within the 99%? You said Anonymous, not Occupy. Off to a tough start huh?
16837	Because I don't believe it's a very far stretch to equate hate speech with violent incitement which is already illegal.	Wat. Yeah, of course. Because we have the first Amendment. No one's argued otherwise, and I'm not sure what your response has to do with the price of tea in China.
16838	Wasn't even worth me stealing it... Lol	IMHO, This is overpriced crap. What's your favorite?

16840	how do we know someone on youtube didnt think of it first?	I saw this all over YouTube and FB
16841	You're not doing it right, if that's the case.	Of course I'm in favor. Really though, I'd be more in favor of a bill that makes it legal to pick up a bag at Spec's on my way home from work. It's completely asinine that I had an easier time getting a bag of reefer as a junior high school kid than I do as a relatively productive adult.
16842	Hate speech is speech that is a little too free.	hate speech is free speech.
16843	My senator is on the list, how shocking.	Here are the 16 Republicans who voted to kill Rand Paul's gun control filibuster before it started
16844	Enough with the misty cosplay (Fixed) shit.	Dat misty cosplay (Fixed, Fixed)
16845	Yeah, Melo really matured....	I never thought I'd say this, but I'm very glad that Lebron has proven me wrong over the last two years about him. I've thought he was an egotistical douche since like 2006, but seeing stuff like this and seeing how he turned shit around to rehabilitate his image after the "Decision" has been a huge pleasure. I was one of the people ecstatic after the Heat lost to the Mavs in 2011, but seeing Lebron come back with such a relentless resolve and focus was pretty damn scary. I still cheered against him when the Heat were nearly knocked out by Indy and then Boston, but seeing him take over crucial games still made me awe-struck just as a basketball fan. Same thing goes for Melo - never liked him until he matured recently, and it's a pleasure to see now.
16846	whos Leo?	Why are the pretty ones never on PCP #leoproblems
16847	Aw come on, not even a celebratory gun for the GOP win?	Business is UP!!!! Gun dealers gotta be happy as clams to keep propagating the hate and fear. If Romney was elected...sales would have gone DOWN.
16848	Good thing there is no way you can change something that is in the constitution.	The "loophole" is actually called the "Bill of Rights". The "Second Amendment" gives the states the right to an orderly militia ( it means they can regulate guns ) it also bans the Federal Government from doing the same. Thats why the vast majority (over 90%) of Federal gun control laws have never , not once, been enforcedion , because they are so blatantly unconstitutional that federal prosecutors don't even bother trying. Back in 1996 a Federal Prosecutor made the mistake of trying to charge someone with violating a federal law that makes it a crime to carry a loaded gun into a school...the courts promptly struck down the law. They cant even ban carrying a gun to school. If you want gun control laws that can actually be enforced , GO TO YOUR STATE GOVERNMENT.
16849	I think that all this realignment, is secretly just about the money...	Conference Realignment Conspiracy Theories in Here I'll toss mine out there. I think that Delaney and Slive are colluding to have the BIG and the SEC rule college football forever. In the first act these two raided the B12. But the PAC came close to landing UT and OU. I think that Slive and Delaney decided that the B12 should survive and not the ACC since a PAC16 could rival the BIG and the SEC. So in the second act, the SEC anoints the B12 as a partner in the Champions Bowl, and the BIG steps into the NJ and MD markets. In the next five years I think we will see a third and final act where the BIG and the SEC separate UVA and Vtech, and the B12 acquires ACC survivors.
16850	Ah another incite-full and detailed story from ign	Quentin Tarantino says "Probably no Kill Bill 3"
16851	Yeah, its not like China has a reputation for this kind of thing.	It is absolutely logical to judge one billion people by the actions of a single person. The statistics add up.
16852	Ohio is lovely this time of year.	Obama returning to White House as Boehner continues vacation in Ohio
16853	A cold shoulder is a kind of attack.	Fox news just said Dems are "attacking religion" because they don't even mention the word "God" in their platform. If they don't even mention God, HOW IS THAT AN ATTACK?! Someone please explain this to me. Rationally, please.
16854	So, none?	Presumably the same reason as every other game.
16855	that must be one of them' third world countries he's talking about	Which one is Israel?
16856	The American ideal of an alien coming to do all the heavy lifting?	I personally dont mind superman as a character, although he is not my favourite but i am slightly worried by everything needing to be dark and edgy. It just seems to be the taste du jour. Superman has always been the hero of the day. He takes his powers from the sun. He is the white knight which is what diametrically opposes him to batman. He is supposed to embody the truth, justice and hard working nature of the american ideal. He fights the unjustices that plague our society by facing them head on. He is the ultimate celebrity of the superhero community. Even in kingdom come when it all goes to crap years in the future he is still the ray of light that the governments will listen to. I know this idea is a hard one to sell in this day and age. But it worries me a little that we seem to be moving farther away from the point of the character. This is just my opinion obviously and i dont actually know what the movie is going to be like. Feel free to disagree with me
16857	But but religion of peace!	Unfortunately, I was forced to take down my blog because of fundamentalist muslim threats to myself and my family... So, even though it did have some impact, I am not willing to forfeit my life or the lives of the people I love in the name of some bogus deity and his barbaric, delusional followers.
16858	Fuck you for coming in here with your "accuracy" and "facts" and ruining a great headline!	this title is inaccurate. that's not what they said. they simply said that congress had not waived sovereign immunity here, contrary to the district court's findings, so the suit could not proceed.

16860	We will never fight again, we learned from our mistakes and wont let history repeat itself.	This is precisely why these sanctions are so stupid. They will cement alliances economically. If such actions continue over the coming years they will quickly find the world divided into two hostile camps. It is actions like this that lay the ground work for world wars. The very idea is unthinkable at the moment, but that can change more quickly than we would like to admit.
16861	Yes but as long as he prays to Jesus while he harms the children and elderly, then he's forgiven and can keep enjoying his money.	So Joe Barton is a false witness and sinner?

16874	Don't worry the parents are paying at least 20k per house.	In NY that's 1500$ a month.

16905	Then give it time.	Yeah, I already said I've stopped doing that...
16906	....but we already have a republican party, so what would change?	The tax revenue is NOT worth opening the US Government directly to the churches. The first step is giving up their tax exempt status. The immediate next step would be creating their own political party, and getting their own candidates into office. I know it may seem that way now, but it's no where near as bad as it could be. We must keep Church &amp; State separate. And everyone should be working towards greater separation than what we have currently. Saying "Well they influence politics already, so we should start taxing them" is GIVING IN to their rule breaking and REWARDING it with greater power. The correct response is penalize and separate further.

16915	Yes, the future of music will conform to your definition of "art".	The Future will restore music to art. We all know that the industry of music has promoted countless forgotten names of mediocrity. That only happened because music was a viable source of money. But since the digital revolution is destroying music's profits, it's only a matter of time before music will be incapable of making money and that greed and lust will no longer be a motivator to musicians, or those that are paraded around to be musicians. Thus the entirety of the musician population will be limited to expressing their art just because they like it, and they think others will, and they want it to be heard. Which is how it should have always been.

16924	You're pretty brave.	For what it's worth, I may simply be expressing my ignorance. I'd hardly say I'm anti-American, but I am biased.
16925	You are nothing if not maladjusted.	A corporation isn't a person and can't actually hold beliefs because only a sentient entity can truly hold a belief. Corporations are not sentient beings and are instead a construct, therefore can not be a person. Therefore corporations have not rights protected by the constitution, but the people who make up those corporations do. As far as your "If you don't like it, get out policy." If corporations don't like providing health care then they can quit being corporations. They need the people more than the people need them, they literally can not exist without people. People can farm off the land or hunt and exist without corporations. So go suck a dick, fascist. Next time, come with an argument and quit being a corporate apologist.

I mean she is smoking hot even without all the makeup but she also has a team of people to make her look smoking hot. I dunno, maybe i am alone here but i look at those people as art. They are made up and airbrushed...etc. I prefer someone with imperfections. Those are my favorite parts of a man. He's real. He's human.
16930	Oh, but that's so sweet!	Something about how he wouldn't be able to control his hands and we would get frisky in real life.
16931	Stop being selfish/entitled.	Oh really? Please oh intelligent one, direct me to a non mmo with those interactions. A guild to chat with, a PvP experience in that type of playstyle, and the occasional gear run. Because I'm pretty damn sure that describes an mmo. But please, enlighten me.

16936	How do you install a hard drive like that on a PS3?	I Checked out Best Buy as I had $45 dollars in coupons and bought it for about $90. If you're interested in the drive I bought you may find it cheaper online. It's a Seagate Barracuda.

16949	Yes, it is always a good idea to commit tax fraud!	Just set your location to somewhere that doesn't have taxes. Also, no.
16950	We should assign everyone their future profession at birth, and train them solely for that, instead of waiting until they are old enough to make their own decisions.

16962	So what you're saying is that Jesus was into S&amp;M.	He also likely ended up with an erection. :D Thanks to the vertical positioning and where the blood would pool. Certain types of muscle cells are activated by calcium ions. After activation, the cells expend energy putting the calcium ions back outside the cell. After death, the membranes become more permeable to calcium and the cells don't expend as much energy to push the ions out, so the muscles contract. So ejaculation was plausible too. :D Enjoy your dead people fun fact.
16963	Are you sure?	Sarcasm.
16964	I love science, it's so logical and reasonable compared to the idiocy of religion!	TIL A Greek scientist jumped into a volcano because he believed he was a god and would be resurrected.
16965	SO BRAVE	Being super-religious. I know I'll be slammed with a horde of "so brave," but I mean like SUPER-religious. I guess I can make an exception if they have a Facebook profile in which I can mock their beliefs
16966	But they're raking in all those valuable internet points!	No, he wrote that on his face so that people don't sell his pictures to celebrity tabloids, he doesn't really care if people take his picture, just as long as they don't make a profit off of his picture.
16967	Thank you.	The Senate voted against the Motion to Proceed to discussion of this terrible bill. The yea's required three-fifths of the full Senate, normally 60 votes. Note that the Bill sponsor Harry Reid voted NO as a procedural maneuver to reserve himself the right to bring the bill to the floor again.
16968	No, you obviously think about reaching into the center console of your car and taking out a gun, pointing it at the guy and pulling the trigger before your think about resume driving.	The driver could have drove way from the scene, but with traffic around and a person hanging on to you through your window its not the easiest or first thing that comes to mind.

16991	It's not particularly stealthy though.	Not everyone gets a nice tidy sexuality that fits into the safe pageantry of BDSM as we tend to think of it- with the outfits and rules and so on. But, one of the reasons why we use these themes in our fiction is as a form of stealth softcore porn.

16996	There isn't a jersey on that site for $25 though, even the replicas are going for more than that.	It seems like a legit site. I can't find a Kuechly jersey on it. And no male jerseys in my size at the price anywhere, but they do have a lot of cool stuff on there there that I like and may end up ordering later. So I'd say it's a good resource.

17007	Sorry, but this statement is a pantheist one and inconsistent with the Abrahamic faiths.	It is the infinite sum of of -,0,+. Your self has created the illusion of separation from the supreme being. When you open your eyes you are looking at God. Even when you look in the mirror and look at other people. God is everyone and everything. We make reality together. If you don't have faith in God you don't have faith in yourself, people, and all his great creation. Thus is the Lord's great will :)

17011	So if a person points a gun at your face, you aren't allowed to aggress against them until they pull the trigger?	Are arguing that the initiation of hostilities without first being threatened is legitimate force? There is no "preemptive" offensive legitimate lethal force. If it's preemptive, the other party has not initiated aggression against you, and thus you are illegitimately aggressing against them. The only legitimate use of force is in defense of yourself or others. No slopes needed, slippery or otherwise.

She can't even lean on the desk she stands next to. All to kill Rick Perry's anti-abortion bill that could close all but 5 clinics in the state.
17026	which mill is this?	If you plan on using a drill to run the mill, you should remount the mill so the axel you lock the drill into is facing into the base plate, and not away from it like you have depicted. The reason for this is the weight of the drill will be acting to tip the mill over. If you have it going the other way, the base plate will balance the mill even with a drill attatched. (I have the same mill) Also they recommend a gap size of 0.045" but I'd get a set of feeler gauges from your local auto shop, and reduce the gap size to 0.040" for a more efficient crush.

17030	Ah, next time try adding a	I'm going with sarcasm too subtle to distinguish from serious. I don't troll, so apparently I am a failure at sarcasm.
17031	She seems kinda unintelligent and indecisive.	I know this isn't a restaurant story, but it's relevant. I used to work at a store where I sold wedding gowns. Every bride/couple we met had a different story. You could usually tell the people who were serious and if the fiance/family came with the bride, you could really get a feel for the relationship. Anyway, a typical appointment lasts from one to two hours depending on how many dresses they want to try on. So, this one particular Saturday, we were having a sale. So it was going to be very crowded. Each consultant worked with one MAYBE two brides, but no more than that. Once you were done with a customer, you'd get assigned another one. So, my first bride of the day is a customer who I'd worked with before - let's call her Jane. It's not unusual for a bride to come in and plan on coming back with friends or family to give a second opinion. So I get her set up in the fitting room and start pulling dresses for her. We try on all of the dresses she'd previously tried on and she was still indecisive. So I ask her what she likes, what she doesn't like, etc. and go pull more dresses. Two hours pass. Then three. Then four. She just wasn't making a decision. She kept calling her fiance and talking to him. I only heard her end of the conversation and, while there weren't any obvious alarm bells, I did think the conversations were odd. They didn't seem happy and excited. So we keep trying on different dresses and veils. My manager even came in to see if she could assist. Nope. I'd been on my feet all day - no lunch break, no bathroom break - all working with this one bride. Finally, after hour 7, her fiance shows up. They FINALLY pick a dress. I get the dress and veil information and take them to the cash register. Jane and her fiance stand at the register and - in the time it took to walk over to the register, there was palpable tension. I just went about going through the process because I didn't know what else to do. After one minute of the tensest silence I'd ever sat through, he turns to Jane and blurts "I can't do this." She just stares at him. I "become busy" with something behind the counter, but am totally right there. Jane starts crying and says, "what?" Her fiance says "I can't do this. I don't want to marry you." And he leaves. Jane and I are left standing there, I'm not entirely sure what to say, I ask if she'd like some tissue and she just shakes her head no and leaves. Easily the most awkward breakup I've witnessed. **TL DR** Worked selling wedding dresses, after a full day helping a bride choose her dress, her fiance comes in and breaks up with her
17032	Foothill Blvd... Narrows down which range the cowboy pimps on...	Any radio commercial where two friends have a conversation that just so happens to include every detail about a business. "Oh what a nice dress Julie!" "Thanks! I got it at Sunshine Dresses on 17482 Foothill Blvd, and if you go Friday, you can get 15% off red tags!"

17034	Ok	No it's not
17035	I thought you were going to say that as you were carrying her, the dildo slid out and hit the floor.	We were doing a lift assist from a hospital for a fat, nasty looking chick. We get her half way down the hall and she says she forgot something in her room. She eventually says what it is. A big, black, dildo, she had left behind a dresser. Funny as hell as a nurse had to go back to the room to get it. She was only there for a day and a half, but couldn't be without her dildo.

17039	but you see, that's the tax payer's problem now, not Walmart's	A study determined that due to low wages and employee's reliance on government subsidies, a typical Wal-Mart store costs taxpayers over $1.7 million per year, or about $5,815 per employee.
17040	yeah but when white people do it it's different	fuck rioters, yellow,brown black or white
17041	That must be why all those Russian orphans do so well later in life.	"Slapping and shoving", which they call "harsh discipline" are a far cry from spanking. Children need to learn to cope on their own, period. The way to do that is by letting them "cry it out".
17042	Yeah, fuck SRS for thinking rape is a serious issue!	Shitty Rape Subreddit has arrived in full force.
17043	finally a reasonable, truthful accurate statement comparing pre and post 911 america .......................	It's a big deal because the terrorists *succeeded*. As a result of 9/11, the United States of America has become a virtual police state, with people being arrested for what they say and do and look at on the internet. You can't walk onto an airplane without government agents molesting you. If you're wearing a turban, you're gonna get shot dirty looks, will get "specially treated" in airports, and might get jumped on the streets in some places. It's like the Cold War fear of communism, but worse, in that it's actually destroying the country from the pure fear. Al-Qaeda accomplished what they wanted to. They've ruined the United States of America.
17044	nice job misunderstanding the issue	Am I the only American left who thinks that protesting killing using drones, but being fine with guided missiles is a tad odd? Why is the word "drone" so upsetting?
17045	Good to see you have your priorities straight.	I did. I was a vegetarian for years, even tried vegan for a few months, but I lift weights and it's kind of hard to put on muscle with that lifestyle.
17046	Yeah right because striker is countered by flares.	if you want to run anything that isn't flares fly vs vanu or nc.
17047	If I recall correctly, it became popular at about the time Hitler was alive...	Funny to see the trademarked Hitler finger-stache went way back, and isn't a newer thing.

17049	I guess I needed this	Raising the riches taxes won't change anything, they need to lower the poor and middle classes taxes. The people who work their balls and/or tits off everyday just to get at the most 75% of their paycheck unless they have exemptions or a million other worthless derivatives.
17050	Had to check the comments to be sure if it was alcohol or weed involved.	So, a guy bites off 40% of my ear before his mates hold me down, glass me and punch my face repeatedly. How was your night?

17054	Don't forget that when they reach the age of 18 their brain evolves to the point of being completely immune to sexual manipulation.	Attraction to children isn't wrong, as long as the the person isn't harming any children. The people that actually carry out their fantasies to people that are too young are sociopathic by definition. However, it's arguable if 15 year old post-pubescent girls are too young to be aware of what they're getting into.
17055	Oh god I hope my boss doesn't see that this cake has the work cunt in it.	It was my cousin Clint's birthday, and his mother-in-law reminds us all about the importance of kerning.
17056	It's always her fault, didn't you get the memo?	Unisex bathrooms should encourage a feeling of safety for everyone involved, not just those who may be incredibly uncomfortable or triggered going into a bathroom they feel they should not be in. The argument that these unisex bathrooms are breeding grounds for woman getting harassed is littered with fallacies. A sign on a door isn't a magical barrier that those with ill intentions cannot cross. It's as simple as "Oh, the other restroom was full.", or probably more commonly no excuse at all because those people don't actually care at all if they are seen in the "wrong" bathroom- they don't intend on getting caught. The fact that the idea that those people will be stopped by a gendered sign is so widespread is pretty disturbing. It reinforces the idea that if a woman (or anyone who is being harassed) is in the right place at the right time they won't be bothered.
17057	Yeah, it is pretty terrible though... no offense.	Is Cool Beans still around? I loved that place.
17058	CAUSE HES BLACK.	Does anybody have the backstory here? I am curious as to why the cops are beating him.
17059	yeah it definitely looks like this dog leads nothing but a life of misery	People need to stop breeding animals like corgis or dwarf cats. It is cruel to fetishize another living thing's deformity.
17060	But PBS and planned parenthood are job killing porkfat that must be eliminated!	Disney, NASCAR, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America gets tax cuts and corporate subsidies in the Fiscal Cliff deal.
17061	This is all obviously George Bushs fault.	Obama's deficit spending $17k per person, $70k per family
17062	Unless the one player is the Illuminati!	I've been saying this to people for years, but you put it much better than I. The big pharma cure-hiding conspiracy people talk about makes absolutely not one bit of sense economically. The only scenario in which it is even vaguely plausible is if there was only one player, and that player had a cute so awesome that it would cut demand for all of their products very quickly. That's naturally not how medicine is, and there isn't only one player. Not only do you have the current cast, but new companies are being created all the time.
17063	Yes, because your body is a sinful construct and you should be ashamed of it.	We had some simple sex ed in class when I was 11 or 12. But this was Sweden. I assume you are in the US?

17070	not a QB = not important	bullshit. should have been 50k + a suspension like the hit on Schaub.
17071	Definitely that movie about the group of Jewish American soldiers who collected Nazi scalps and shot the hell out of Hitler.	What are the best movies about major historical or political events? For example, a movie about the transition of Rome to from a Republic to an Empire, or about the fall of the Soviet Union. The movies should hopefully not be full of egregious historical errors. Mel Gibson's stuff is probably not appropriate.
17072	Because no one ever makes shit up on the internet.	But he said he was right when he said it.
17073	Basically, he's wanting the government to be the only ones with guns, because there's never been a government that slaughtered millions of its citizens after disarming them	You are clearly advocating for taking away the right to produce. So my original comment is valid. I didn't specify gun ownership, I said rights and freedoms in general. Just because some conservative minds may agree with you doesn't mean that the result isn't the same.
17074	Lyanna has magical baby morphing powers.	I think it would be pretty easy to surmise what had happened when Ned walks out with a baby.
17075	Obviously being a straight white man is frowned upon in Sweden, especially if you're a crime victim.	Ok let me rephrase my question, although obvious it's just for the sake of record. Is a "man, straight, a crime victim" okay in Sweden? Like, a heterosexual guy that doesn't diss and provoke others and somehow was victim of some crime (let's say rape in this case) normally are OK and not bullied in Sweden?
17076	Yes humans have existed for 3 billion years and drank salt water all that time	Makes perfect sense
17077	You should have added 5 duplicates of each picture to really get the point across - like they did in the live presentation.	Pics from the Battlefield 3 E3 Livechat about Armored Kill

17081	The condemnation of Hitler is nothing more than cultural elitism.	List of other people in history who should be accepted for their unusual practices: 1. John Wayne Gacy 2. Adolph Hitler 3. Kim Jong Il 4. George W. Bush ps - stoning people to death for *alleged* adultery is a bit more than 'unusual' in non-extremist societies.

17085	are there any big names challenging him?	Reince Priebus will seek another term as RNC chairman
17086	I think the better question is will he win the 2014 election?	Will Bill Shorten win the 2016 election? I had my doubts at first, since theres only been a one term government once in our history(correct me if I'm wrong). But do you think Bill shorten has a chance of winning 21 + seats to win the 2016 election.

17093	Nanoskin products are a bit more costly but they also last much longer which is another option.	I have found a cheaper clay Ok, I'm not a pro detailer, but have recently started taking MUCH better care of my cars, and clay is something I do a good bit. I'm also a hacker, and began looking at a less expensive alternative, and found it: Plastalina modeling clay. It's available on amazon and at places like hobby lobby. It is softer than auto clay bars, but it actually cleans better because of it. I did a side by side of Meguair's clay and Plastalina on my wife's 2006 Accord, and the plastalina was dirtier when done. I used a weak car wash soap solution as lube on both. The softer plastalina means it can smear easier, but the cheap car wash lube means you can use plenty with no issue. I also tried both with QD spray, and the results were the same. Plastalina cleaned better, built still tended to smear quicker if not lubed enough. Meguairs: $17/2 bars, Plastalina: $3.99 / lb - do the math - I'll take an infrequent smear any-day!

17096	I don't see GTA V do I?	So, you need a console, why not all of them?
17097	Sounds like your internet is from the 80s	I'll start watching Colbert when they decide to stop using crappy ass video players. Really? you have to buffer every 10 seconds?
17098	...So how'd you get the photo off your phone and onto reddit?	Lost my phone to the river, but not before taking this picture
17099	You know what they call a "shocker"...?	SHOCKCEPTION.
17100	This kills the Rhoa.	I teach mine to use scrolls of wisdom. Less expensive to feed this fierce beast
17101	Is this really the place to ask?	Siv HD Stream Down? Did it just crash?

17103	yes, you can	Can you play DS games online with the 3DS? I recently started playing Pokemon heartgold and when I try to go into Wifi it never works, does anyone else have this problem?
17104	But what would happen to Adelaide...	Sex Party Announces Cannabis Led Recovery for Tasmania
17105	From Ender's Game right?	I bet people like the maker of this don't even know who John Locke or Rene Descartes are. But don't worry, they know who Carl Sagan and Neil De-Grasse Tyson are, so they're obviously super enlightened.
17106	I tried to make a new user account for a professional version of me, but Google made it too hard, so fuck it.	YouTube, then and now
17107	I've seen satellite images of what are supposedly their enrichment reactors.	Thank you for telling me I was very curious about this.
17108	The NSA is getting personal on a whole new level.	How do you poop?
17109	Year long contracts are definitely the norm and most of them are signed around the beginning of the year (if possible).	From what I understand, year-long contracts are the norm. I don't think that many organizations would be willing to shell out big bucks for a top-tier team unless they could keep them around for a little while.
17110	You forgot the	The Bruins. Their fans think that their team is the sparkling example of perfection in every way, but they're scumbags and take cheap shots. (Most teams do, just not as much as Boston)
17111	Must be an American.	That's an odd way to spell 'person'.
17112	I agree.	I think Indiana will end up in the East for an attempt at competitive balance.
17113	Does it not have a web UI?	Netgear GS105E, if you don't need that many ports.
17114	Well, this is eventful.	*She nods and walks away*
17115	As someone who makes a living drawing stuff, talent alone won't get you there, you have to be a business man too.	Your product is only worth as much as someone is actually willing to pay for it. Yeah, he could probably make a few bucks on the side if he put a decent website together and offered on-demand prints, made himself available for commission work, and maybe got some of his work into a gallery but generally speaking you're not going to earn $30,000+ a year by drawing stuff. I'm a musician and it's the same way for me. I could spend an entire year writing and recording a single song that might be the most brilliant musical exercise since Bohemian Rhapsody but when that's said and done all I've got is a few dozen gigs of data on a hard drive that I've squashed into a 4MB mp3 file that a dozen people MIGHT decide is worth $0.99 on iTunes. Art is fantastic but just being good at something isn't enough to earn a living.
17116	I think they exported so much to the middle east that they are now running a little low themselves.	Hey, America, how's that democracy going?
17117	Your comment definitely deserves a downvote.	Yeah, maybe. I'm not convinced it would have made much difference.
17118	Was he the one who touched them too?	TIL Over the last 15 years, Max Martin is responsible for the success of almost every band/pop star that I hate .....
17119	Since always	Rofl, the history of everything. How old was your country again?

17121	Nom Nom Nom	Huh, I was going to say the same about your post...
17122	see you at piazza del sole in my civic bro!	Woodbridge. North East, to be more precise.
17123	Gee... Kinda hard to tell from that video as you don't get the audio... But I'm sure the cops yelled "STOP RESISTING" a few times, so it's all good.	Dallas officer shoots mentally handicapped man four times who standing with arms at his side.
17124	ACC bias!	3 ACC teams in top 10
17125	Anecdotes are just like science!	What Happened When A Woman Drank Only Soda For 16 Years
17126	Nearly 50% against a player pool that includes many foreigners is pretty appalling for a player of his calibre in the other two matchups.	reddit hype makes people seem worse than they actually are.
17127	Because they're super-duper euphoric and enlightened.	Why do so many atheists wear Fedoras?

17130	Yes, let's all just regurgitate Our Team's party orthodoxy, because the only thing we care about is that Our Team wins the election	What an absolute fucktard. You're a labor fan so you undermine them before an election to get Abbott. Moron.
17131	Yeah, because why should technology advance if you don't personally see a use in it?	I can't even tell the difference between 720 and 1080, this 4k shit can just stay not a thing.
17132	it has been fixed just as Fizz E	Invisible particles are STILL in the game... Seriously guys how long has this been in the game, altough it doesn't happen that often, it happens and thats reason enough to fix it already. I'm pretty tired of standing somewhere just watching my character and then suddenly hearing a nidalee spear hitting me.
17133	shirts off hour bro.	... you took your shirts off?
17134	They probably dressed like sluts and asked for it by being so easy.	Just found this in r/funny. Who would find this humorous?
17135	Then you should remove your infant sons' prostates along with their foreskins, just in case.	I know what I lived through. I wouldn't wish cancer on anyone.
17136	Now now, it's no time to be making enemies.	As a British citizen, fuck Barrack Obama, the buck stops with our Prime Minister, I may not agree with his policies or the decisions he is making but god dammit the man is in charge of the country (or is it the queen?) anyway, the point is, Britain is Britain, we shouldn't have to answer to America.
17137	There are worse analogies so we should ignore that one.	I was thinking more in the lines of collecting the drops that was wasted funds. probably a bad analogy in hindsight lol...
17138	I'm afreud I don't know.	Hang on... How did we get from sexy to dad?
17139	Not in America, dialup providers used to do this and it was ruled illegal because they'd be artificially increasing the size of whatever website you were viewing and then charging you to download the ads that they injected.	Bloody hell! Is this legal?
17140	Unless it's a guy, because guys can't be raped.	There are punishments for false accusations. Police and prosecutors just refuse to prosecute women for false reporting as they would get a ton of flak for doing so. Any time someone appears to be treating a possible rape victim with anything but white gloves, people get up in arms.
17141	Because people that get divorced an have children deserve less rights than other people	Bigger issue: Why the fuck can judges insert morality clauses into ANYONE'S divorce agreement? Especially without their knowledge.
17142	I'm sure Cleveland Lebron would do just fine against the Spurs in the finals.	"I just kind of went back to my Cleveland days."
17143	Wow you know it's getting serious when Reddit and 4Chan join a coalition for a movement.	Mozilla, Reddit, 4Chan join coalition of 86 groups asking Congress to end NSA surveillance
17144	Well if I don't have them, why should they?	Republicans propose bill that would require welfare recipients to sign a waiver to their 4th amendment rights
17145	I wonder if there's a Google Streetview	because fuck people
17146	Think about all the possible crimes that those white straight privileged cis male children could have committed!	Well, in fairness to her, she only killed a couple of patriarchy-propagating, raping males. It's not like she killed anybody who would have grown up to be a useful member of society.
17147	Someone has to help out CNN and it might as well be us right?	Seriously, stop it. The FBI pays experts to analyse this information. They know what they're doing, you don't. Your hearts are in the right place, but you're making things worse. Leave it to the experts.
17148	because the muzzled dogs are the safe ones.	I doubt it will hurt anyone - notice the muzzle? Still sad though.
17149	Well i consider u lucky, i gotta do my workouts at -15 to -30 celsius cos i dont have anything to do pullups other than trees outside.	I'm jealous of everyone that can do this shit. I'm stuck in my garage.

17153	I &lt;3 my ARL.	Update your addons. Please. Update before you post a bug for the authors. Also read what the authors want reported with the bug. And follow up to see if the author needs more information/has fixed the bug/has tried to fix the bug but isn't sure and wants you to test it out. Also remember that the authors aren't paid by anyone for the most part and we do this as a hobby.
17154	You forget this	We'll all be waiting for you to report back your findings, son

17159	I'm not a hipster, I just heard it before it was cool, that's all	Nope, excitebike is old. I remember hearing it years ago.

17162	It's okay because she is a brave, strong woman who is taking the issue head on.	Sarah Silverman makes rape joke same night as Tosh and everyone laughs.
17163	Yep, Skyrim will definitely be 83% off, you should wait.	Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition Or Skyrim I'm deciding whether or not to buy F:NV Ultimate Eddition now for $10 or wait and see if Skyrim goes up for 10$. What do you guys think ?
17164	It's because they hand you towels.	Been to the US a few times, and when using toilets in airports couldn't help but be baffled by the staff sat there with a tip bowl.
17165	Yeah, that's about as implausible as them forgetting to check if their probes software was running on Metric instead of Imperial.	No, this story is obviously false to anyone familiar with the Apollo Program. It contradicts recorded history, and doesn't even pass the sniff test. Take a second to understand the implications, if true: NASA engineers had forgotten about the Lunar-orbital trajectory that Apollo 8 had followed. The engineers responsible for the most stunning technological achievement in human history had forgotten how to perform an elementary orbital maneuver that was specifically planned for as an emergency option. How can someone think this is even remotely plausible?
17166	Oh dear god how DARE they have a contest where you could win things that are related to the product line they are selling.	You can't be serious. You are trying too hard Microsoft.
17167	But what if you miss	Saiga-12 home defense setup
17168	Yeah, because UFC is his problem.	Rampage claims he will only fight once more in the UFC, but hints that he won't be retiring after that fight.
17169	Well ya, cuz you know, male privilege	That is ridiculously sexist.
17170	People are the same as animals and should be treated exactly the same.	If this woman can kill her own animals in the name of art, shouldn't I just be able to kill her and display her body in some grotesque display under the same guise?
17171	Sarcastic dry wit comedy is supposed to be taken SUPER SERIOUS!	Is this seriously NOT the wrong message to make about the game? I mean, you'd think that they would try to steer clear of "you avoid real physical relationships to play this game" stigma. All this does is reinforce the perception people have about the game. That those who play it are loners, who don't interact with anyone that aren't pixels in a video game. Bad move Blizzard, bad move.
17172	his share probably went towards fighting piracy, because it's killing the industry	TIL: Winston Groom, the author of the original Forrest Gump book, didn't receive a single cent in royalties for the money the film made ($677 million), because of a practice called "Hollywood Accounting".
17173	But these diplomats and politicians are the state, and the state represents the people, so he fucked over the american people.	Yeah, a guy who released low level diplomatic cables that were embarrassing but resulted in no deaths vs two men whose actions got people *executed* and handled over highly classified intelligence to a rival (seriously, you called Russia an ally to prove your point??). Clearly Manning is a monster.
17174	But ILL_Show_Myself_Out, all the top CEO's of Fortune 500 companies have Liberal Arts degrees...	Major in something useful, if you can.
17175	He had to do it!	Turned out to be? You mean always was, and only thinly concealed through obfuscation by his mass personality cult?
17176	Yeah, I saw this in W.	A friendly reminder of why you won't see a withdraw from Iraq or Afghanistan any time soon.
17177	..What?	I totlay agree. You dont see me trying to get a job in a brothel or as a stripper.
17178	A cop like that would be fucked here in cocksuckin' Nova Scotia.	17-Year old girl calls 911 for her dying father, gets arrested for dropping the F-bomb instead
17179	Thanks Higby!	correct
17180	Actually COD 27, but good try.	Close. COD 11
17181	You can also get a good meal, and do whatever you feel.	Is that a workout move? I've gotten so built lately from working out at the Y. I really like the YMCA, because they've got good Christian values. Sometimes, if I'm feeling a little groggy out on the campaign trail, I'll just hop in a Y to use their showers.
17182	Just write your own novel, get it published, and then have it be wildly successful so that in 100 years, someone will write a play that someone else apparently can't relate to because of cultural drift.	The Christmas Carol as a play perpetuates white capitalist ideology, rather than criticizes it, through the lack of characters that are people of color, denying people of color their historical significance in Victorian-era London. In addition, the portrayal of men as head-of-household reinforces patriarchal notions. I'll have none of this problematic play.
17183	ACA's been benefiting me by letting me stay on my dad's insurance.	Those assholes gleefully defeated Clinton's health care reform in 1993... and *now* they're supposedly going to offer their own plan? If they can't do something to defeat ACA they're going to be completely doomed when (OK, and if) ACA actually benefits society; they've to a large degree defined themselves by their opposition to it.
17184	yer moms should step up her game.	TIL Mitt Romney makes as much money in a day as my mom (a high school teacher at one of the top rated public schools in the country) makes in a year.
17185	The article is dated today?	Repost.
17186	I would say that it *is necessary* to reject incompatible beliefs if one wants to stay consistent.	Is that really necessary? Did you see it as your time to pounce?
17187	I think that they're adding Time Warp in order to overlap with Forcefields, so they can rework them.	Do you guys think that the time warp ability will overlap with forcefields? Protoss will basically be able to control engagements just the way they want them and will only take engagements they want. What do you think?
17188	I think your roommate might be gay.	Today I realized my room mate isn't a Muslim, he's just an asshole.
17189	By 'enabling drug addiction,' you mean 'preventing drug addicts from starving to death,' yes?	Because I don't believe in enabling drug addiction with my tax money
17190	The best redditors are the ones who don't misinterpret an all-caps comment as a rage, but instead recognize them as an excited, anxious question as the speaker hangs in anticipation of what the Legos are in posession of.	The best grammar nazis are the ones who are calm, polite, and witty, not the ones who rage.
17191	So then when they don't make it to youtube anymore, we will all just say, "We don't live in a police state, because we never see any videos of police misconduct!"	Seriously. Cops can be assholes, but if we were living in a police state, shit like this wouldn't even make it to youtube.
17192	Its a plastic bag, not a thermos.	I don't think that's a good idea without some ventilation. Overheating.
17193	That will get you shot on Reddit, don't you know that generalizations are ALWAYS wrong?	You know that generalizations aren't inherently fallacious, right?
17194	How considerate of Nokia... They wanted him to have a better phone...	Nokia offering Lumia to Samsung owner who's Galaxy S4 caught fire.
17195	IF YOU WOULD JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET ME READ MY LIST	I can't wait to see the protest video.
17196	Uh oh, a woman dared to be photographed with tight clothes on, time to focus on what's really important in life!	User snaps a lovely picture of a proposal at an airport, but reddit knows the best part of this picture: "Dat ass"
17197	3 (possibly more) of the from the vaults from my LGS came with an extra Cephalid Coliseum instead of Boseiju.	So my FTV: Realms had a 2nd Ancient Tomb instead of a Boseiju. What should I do? I'm not the only one at my LGS that got one this way either. We're waiting to see how the rest of them open up.
17198	Ha fuckin Socialists it'll never work.	TIL Utah is on track to end homelessness by giving each homeless person an apartment and access to social services through their Housing Works program, no strings attached.
17199	Well it didn't help that OP was late.	Ugh I'm just so confused now. I know there are a lot of crazy homeless in the city but this guy seemed so confident in his code, was on time wearing blue and everything.. maybe there's more than one person behind this?
17200	Ya, I'm sure that's what is happening.	One of these days it will be revealed that Israel it's self staged a majority (not all) of these attacks to justify the land grabs and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians.
17201	Just a word of advice .. use a credit card if you can .. better theft protection, build credit plus get 1-2% rebates.. just pay your bill on time.	Debit cards...
17202	The real Mitt Romney once again shows his true colors.	Mitt Romney is criticized by gay-rights groups for blocking routine birth certificate approvals for same-sex parents
17203	... and even *sparkle*.	The scary thing is that there are alien vampires who are fine under *our* sun.
17204	And I'm gonna have to quit the military, it looks like.	Oh ok, I'll quit my voice acting job for an ad firm, and my job as a DJ then, because I clearly don't have a life. Oh and may as well drop out of college
17205	There are websites that get a bunch of no-life people to go around mass-trolling people by either starting rumors or even just the usual spam like "fight me IRL" or "U iz Gay lolz".	YouTube comments on The Crooked Man. People keep commenting on Pewdie's third Crooked Man video saying "RIP". Other people said that Pewdie died in a car crash this morning. I know that this is all untrue, but was just wondering how these rumours started. If anyone knows, please tell me in the comments.
17206	Your dad obviously had great morals and raised a fine kid.	back before times of the internet my Dad would by a legit copy of an OS or other essential program for a hefty price. he would then go and try to get a refund for it but Best Buy's policy is no refunds for opened packages (they had serial keys printed in the box or on the manual), so he would return it for a brand new copy with some spiel about it might being defective, or that the inside packaging was not normal. They would then hand him a brand new unopened CD to "try again", only he would jump right back in line and ask for a full refund for the product and give them a new spiel about it not having the correct system specs or buying the wrong version on accident. Same day, same desk, same clerk, within 5-10 minutes of the previous return, gets full money back and a free OS. Dad: *buys Windows 95, installs, enters key, packs it up and goes back to Best Buy* Clerk: i'm sorry sir we cannot refund opened packages Dad: i would like to exchange it for a new copy, i think there was some damage in the internal packaging/my serial key didn't work Clerk: *hands him a brand new copy with box and receipt* Dad: *jumps back in line* I would like to refund this unopened item, i changed my mind and dont want it anymore, its within 30 days of purchase and i have my receipt. Clerk: *eye roll* here's your refund sir. I only saw him do this once, but i learned and did this for multiple keys of CS, SC, WC, Diablo, etc. I would get the occasional (very rarely) your CD key is already in use but it didnt matter. FREE GAME! *note this was back in times of dial up, return policies may have since changed and we have torrents now so meh*
17207	I *might* be around on Sunday.	Summerfest Meet Up I know a few of us at the meetup this past weekend were talking about meeting up at Summerfest. I'm thinking of going this weekend, not for any particular band but more to just walk around and enjoy everything else. Anyone else interested in coming?
17208	I don't think folders work how you think they work.	subfolders
17209	I wish I knew how to bootcamp games.	How many hours have you put into Skyrim? Over 7-10 characters, I've put in around 600 hours on PC, PS3, and Mac. 25 days well spent.
17210	Wow, A replay of all the lies.	Paul Ryan Acceptance Speech
17211	I wish programming was as easy as poking a computer.	This is one thing that I think the Catholic Church gets right. They have incorporated modern scientific findings into their belief system in a way that makes sense. I've always imagined this belief as God creating the point of infinite density and "poking" it to cause the big bang, and everything that has happened all was according to his plan. This, coupled with Genesis being a metaphor (world created in 6 days vs. billions of years), makes the origin story of the world easily combined with modern science.
17212	You mean the tip of the pen, right?	It probably has something to do with what's going through their head at the time. No, not that head, the other one.
17213	The Great Gatsby is a novel from 1925 but people keep bringing it up that's so nerdy	The real cringe is the Star Wars reference. It's just a movie from the 70s, stop trying to apply it to every single thing in your life, nerds.
17214	ERRMAAGERRRDD BAN GUNS	TIL An elementary school clerk in Georgia convinced a gunman carrying an AK47 and 500 rounds of ammo into surrendering.
17215	But that's fine because he's just so *badass*.	But Walt lives in betrayal, deception and lying like a fish in water.
17216	And they didn't improve it in the intervening years whatsoever.	Apple bought the company that made the fingerprint scanner for the Atrix.
17217	It made me pissed off that I had to move my mouse to mute the video.	The music wasn't really necessary...
17218	It has a cool beat.	ok... maybe I'll check it out. For Science.
17219	They are, because they can kill someone and still get paid for it.	TIL reddit thinks cops are worse than serial killers.
17220	Because their competition has been so good	Something that should be considered: Louisville is the only team in the country that hasn't trailed this year and they've beaten every team they've played by at least 14 points.
17221	Stop.	well, maybe their stupid fucking fantasies of some sky god saving people make them think that they can deny funding for science and research.
17222	Did Adam get a tan or something?	Saw these guys at Kanye West last night. They collectively said "baller" over 11 times.
17223	Oh, you.	Oh, *stop!*
17224	hilarious......	This popped up on my Facebook Feed - - Imgur
17225	Didn't expect to see this one...	vaccinations are bad/unnecessary/optional
17226	Yeah I don't see what people are so worried about, it's not like the government is spying on the entire country and people are being facing imprisonment for YEARS over comments they make over the internet.	We're not talking hypothetical. You really need to educate yourself. Not only were past DC gun bans deemed unconstitutional, but they DO have a ban on dancing at the Thomas Jefferson Memorial (don't you think dancing is a form of first amendment free speech?) Also, with all the shit going on with the NSA circumventing the 4th amendment, how is it possible that people like you exist thinking such a thing could never happen? Oh no, but BIG FOOT! LOL! FUNNY STUFF YOU GOT ME THERE! :|
17227	Wait, you mean 16GB of storage doesn't actually cost an extra $100?	Anyone that understands computer hardware to any degree would know that Apple frequently charges 3 or 4x the value of the parts in each computer. This company ripping people off should be a shock to no-one.
17228	because women are just sexual objects.	But actually a twosome.
17229	weshouldprobablyhavesex.gif	Our usernames are almost identical. I just thought that was cool.
17230	Then blue car comes back and says to your car, "what a fuckin asshole".	The blue car parks like an asshole, but it doesnt stop me.
17231	I'm not talking about history, I'm talking about science, and history wise, there's no 'historical' evidence for numerous things in the bible, outside of the bible.	But the gospels were written from 30-70 years after Jesus' death. Which is way better than many people of the ancient world.
17232	I like it a lot, the people are cool.	Hey, how do you like working there if you don't mind me asking? I was interested in one of the jobs I saw on GA Tech's website.
17233	Typical German, oppressing the Slavs.	This was in year 7, secondary school, don't know what that is in America, so pardon me.Polish guy who came to England is being rude, calling names and acting like a general arse about my grandfather being German. My grandfather ( I never met him, he died before I was born) actually wanted to fight against Hitler, was a big game hunter and an awesome zoologist. He said all Germans were nazis, were evil and stuff like that. We were in German class (where he said stuff about Germany most of the time) and we were chosen to sit next to each other. After insulting me and mocking me in front of the whole class, as we're about to leave I see red and punch him and kick him right in his head and arse. All the popular kids in class laughed and congratulated me (I wasn't very popular and had few friends, so this was great) and I was so happy. Worth the internal exclusion though.
17234	Do you have a source?	Correction: **Some** humans don't need animal protein to live healthy lives. By and large, we are omnivores.
17235	Every time I see Chris Chocula's name, I read it as Count Chocula and check to see if I clicked an Onion link.	Club For Growth To Republicans: Trigger A Default, Or Else!
17236	"condemning" just seems like a pretty loaded word compared to "criticizing"	Well it's an inflamatory way to say it. Calling something "stupid" without backing it up is almost always meant as an insult to everything associated with what you're criticising. However, to condemn something and to have reasons rather than just calling it "stupid" is not insulting to people who practice it, at least not to reasonable ones. There are always those who will *take* insult from criticism, but the act is not inherently insulting.
17237	But bootstraps!	What pounds the problem is that a bachelors or trade degree is now required to be barely middle class, whereas previously high school was all that was necessary. The difference is high school is free, post high school training is not. The government is essentially passing the costs of required education to the students.
17238	Those darn natives!	Hah that's a fair point. I guess I threw that in to emphasize that I'm familiar with China not only from what I have studied in the classroom in an academic setting, but also from having lived with a Chinese family and spent time personally with Chinese natives in a natural setting.
17239	So unprofessional.	He was on pace to outscore Rick Nash had he not been traded.

17244	If you're looking to do this on a budget, it'd be helpful to know what country you're in (and if you're US/Canada, what state/province)	Does Reddit Have Any Good Vacation Ideas? I need ideas for a good vacation spot for a family of 5; a 11 year old boy who likes sports, a 15 year old boy who likes science, a 18 year old girl who likes history, mostly WWII, a 36 year old man who likes the outdoors, and a 36 year old woman who likes quiet. Any good ideas that don't show up on a Google search? mind you we are on a budget. Thanks!
17245	i heard it grows on directory trees, maybe you can harvest them	Ways of earning BTC without mining / buying ? Hey guys, I was wondering if there's any way of earning BTC without having to be a miner or a buyer.
17246	I thought it was "man the fuck up and ask her out."	The first rule of dating for guys: Unless she tells you she's interested, she's probably not.
17247	Yes because that's worked before right?	If a culture arises in which disparaging ideas about women become shunned or unacceptable as a result of this awareness, rapes will be reduced.
17248	Because only 90's kids will remember this..	I'm not sure how this commercial is a classic.
17249	Plus all of their periods would eventually be on the same cycle, and then nobody in the company would get anything done 1 week out of 4!	There'd be no synergy because all the women would have secret alliances and talk shit about each other all the time.

17255	Well you sound like a stand up human being-he must be a lucky man	My husband is great hardworking and the best dad. But I hate him is this normal?!
17256	Yes, because a link to their facebook helps me find out what they sound like.	Fathoms Pass- Before the Dawn
17257	TIL that getting a vasectomy ruins your manhood.	What hate for women here. I don't agree with that at all. What needs to happen is for this female specimen to be sued into oblivion, then wonder why the fuck you ruined your manhood for someone. Idiot.
17258	I think the circular bomb is an homage to Batman Forever, and the bomb that Two-Face brought to the circus.	Since when has Chris Nolan ever released an extended cut of any one of his film's? . . . and if you really think about it, DKR was actually about Batman and Robin, with Robin 'rising' to the Dark Knight mantle at the end of the film.
17259	It's probably because the belts don't leave any evidence at the crime scene right?	It's as if they looked up the wikipedia article on guns and then picked and chose at random. "Ooh, yeah, disintegrating belts. I don't know what those are, but they sure sound scary - those definitely have to go."
17260	Yes, and the strikeforce of Drogba and Torres was the sole reason for that.	Yes, I do remember winning the Champion's League.
17261	Cmon man Obama is above that kinda shit, hes the most open president in history.	Obama's AMA has a User who was a Redditor for 4 hours, post 1 question. It got answered. Should Reddit be used dishonestly like that?

17270	How the fuck are forest fires analogous to rape in any way	If you're not a rapist then you have no reason to be offended. I'm a man and I don't think twice about them. Neither does anyone else I know. That's fucking absurd. When you see PSAs about not starting forest fires do you get offended too? Are you mad because Smokey is "targeting people?" That's the most obtuse and transparent kind of bullshit. It's nothing but a paper-thin ad-hoc rationalization.
17271	C'mon now, an average opposing QB rating of like 140 isn't THAT bad.	Claiborne for obvious reasons

17280	That would have just made her seem more like a "hero".	Yeah, what the fuck, people get unjustifiably beaten and shot and abused by cops all the time, yet this bitch doesn't even get handcuffed or marched out. The cops should have given her a double suplex down the stairs. Mostly because that would be hilarious but also because she's a lunatic who thinks she's Jesus.

17284	This best part about this is Rule 34 existing, so pretty much everything has a "porn version" of it so everything would be guilty.	"If bronies didn't want to be stigmatized then they should've stopped people from making porn" This is the best part! Hey, you Americans! If you didn't want me to hate you, then you should've worked to shut down Playboy! ...well actually no, the best part is how she references Andrea Dworkin. In her post about policing people in your social group. Brilliant!

17286	I care about Karma, it's just now I think I have enough to pretend like I don't.	I understand. I think that the only good mods are those who are ambivalent about karma. Care too much in either direction and it won't work out.
17287	Adjustable hands would be awesome!	I wish they were adjustable.
17288	Nothing wrong with some Ace of Base	Disagree. The significant stuff tends to be the stuff we remember. Otherwise, backstreet boys, take that, spice girls, ace of base et al. Would be the things that come to mind when thinking of the 90s.
17289	Peace be with you.	My Sunday has been emotional. I go to a mega church in the Joplin area, and the sermon series that we are going through is called The Message. This one was about forgiveness and how if you can't forgive your brother, how can God forgive you? Almost immediately after church I went with some friends to a visitation for a close friend of mine who was killed in a car accident on Wednesday on his way to church. He was a close friend to all of us, and we were the last ones to see him alive. On the way back, we took the highway that he was killed on, and we were at peace. In a little bit, I'm going to be going to a college ministry thing that I never really go to. Its called Upper Room, and I feel its something I have to do just out of respect to my friend. After that we will probably go to Applebees for half price appetizers. But yeah... It has been an emotional weekend altogether.
17290	Did it ever occur to you that this would be a derpette?	Look at how shiny that dudes fingernails are. Seriously WTF.
17291	So exactly how many companies does this cover?	The "living wage" bill only raises minimum wage for employees of large retailers with parent companies worth more than $1B and store areas larger than 75k square feet. I'm all for raising minimum wage for *everyone*, such that working any full-time job will at least disqualify you for government food/medical supplementation. However, this bill was written only to apply to very large companies. If it passes, Walmart will *not* be replaced by a large company willing to pay the higher wage, they will be replaced by several companies small enough to avoid the law and still only pay the current ~$8/hr wage. This is a lot of political posturing to make it look like we are defeating a Boogieman everyone loves to hate, but I don't think it will result in anyone actually getting payed the higher wages.
17292	Lack of atmosphere!	I didn't know the temperature fluctuation was so extreme.
17293	And I wish most would take into consideration what was needed to make a median income in 1938 vs today.	Exactly, this would be a lot more meaningful if they were comparing median incomes.

17308	Fuck OUYA, it's a piece of shit and anyone who bought one just wasted their money.	Wouldnt a OUYA do this with the use of emulators?
17309	What did HE say (as to what the reason was)?	Wow, well, I suppose that makes sense. Seems there is a legit reason to be mad at this guy.
17310	All I see is OP posting a picture with a sign in it.... any racist connotation is on you, friend ;)	Racist
17311	But how are they supposed to get those precious seats that just became available if they don't squeeze in immediately?	Couldn't agree more with this, it's just like with riding a train or a subway. People getting off have the right of way!
17312	What if you're fapping to a feminized version of yourself?	Ladies and gentlemen, fapception. Go deeper by a level and you can implant the idea that you're not gay.
17313	Oh leave the guy alone, its just a little .50	And stopped where? Shooting trees without a backstop, you're a shining example of a responsible gun owner.

17316	Sorry, you lost me at "Louis CK is a hack".	First off, Louis CK is a hack. 2nd off, no one forced that person to buy that house. I own a house I put tenants in. All tenants are retarded. Do you rent? Therefore you too are retarded. My wife had done this elaborate garden with various flowers and bushes and trees and roses in it. Was very pretty. Constantly got compliments on it. The current tenants signed the fucking lease when the garden was in full bloom. Wouldn't you know those fuckers pulled out all the roses, all the flowers, cut years of growth off all the trees. The buses are all trimmed to ankle height. My wife is fit to be tied. The yard looks like complete shit. I asked those retards what exactly they had in mind. They told me, I shit you not, I can't make this stuff up. I am not creative. They told me that he was allergic to bees and couldn't be around pollinating flowers lest he got stung. Oh, the 3 year old got cut shoving her hand in a rose bush. Do you know how often landlords maintain elaborate flower beds in rental units? Barely ever. There is no other rental in our town with an elaborate garden like that. I was trying to attract someone that liked to garden. IF THE FUCKER WAS ALLERGIC TO BEES WHY DID HE CHOOSE A HOUSE FULL OF FUCKING ROSES AND FLOWERS? I asked him that. He had no answer. ----------- No one forced this stupid person to buy that house. There are plenty of houses out of town that are not covered by in city zoning laws. You buy a house in the city and you want to do something that none of your neighbors have done you best check the laws.
17317	:o I'm telling :(	fuckin reck u cunt!
17318	I feel like if we ever get the opportunity to show THIS idea works it'll be a lot of... hold the fuck on, just trust us... we know what we're doing... voluntary and shit	I agree. I want to end the government entirely. But we can't do that over night. We need to give people time to adapt, to form new voluntary relationships to replace their coercive relationship with the state.
17319	Can't Photoshop you in front of a coffin either...	Telling me I wouldn't get an excused absence for a funeral unless I got a picture of me standing in front of the coffin. A program wasn't enough because I could easily "make one in photoshop."
17320	I'm just about positive that once your trophy level is below 100 you only lose 1 trophy each time.	why are you loosing only 1 all the time?
17321	I limit my reddit time otherwise it just fucks up all of my days.	So we all know the internet isn't on our side... So I was on a website that I enjoy, when I found a thread asking people to post about unpopular opinions they have. (It wasn't reddit, if you're wondering.) Well, I made the horrible mistake of saying that I was transgender and that transphobia annoys me... and received an overwhelming amount of responses that boiled down to "fuck you". What do you folks do when you encounter transphobia on a website you frequent? Do you try to defend trans* people, or just ignore it?
17322	Yeah, Walt looks super irritated in this gif!	Been there done that -- highly IRRITATING! :)
17323	Linux	Neat, what are you running on it?
17324	its only function should be things not able to be done at the State level, for example international diplomacy... and I'd say they're doing a swell job at that, right?	"Useless" You can't think of a single essential task performed by the federal government?
17325	It'll still probably be at the top of youtube for Halloween though, and that's what really matters	Haha, in a way, yes. I should have known stuff is not going to be good when "Dear Esther was just 2deep4U"-Thechineseroom made the game. It's not baaaaad. It's atmosphere is absolutely stellar. Only there's nothing else. The story is paper thin, the metaphor is obvious and boring after 5 minutes, there's no gameplay. Meh.
17326	whoah, I've never seen a funny video before!	other guys in these comments act like they've never seen a sseth video.....
17327	no, there's only asian fathers with high expectations.	There is no 99% in Japan?
17328	Sure, seems like a totally fair trade.	like i said, Fred to Bills for Byrd
17329	but they have been enslaved on a large scale, it's called "marriage"	Don't forget that white women still have less privilege than black men, despite the fact that white women have never been enslaved on a large scale.
17330	Zelda: Majora's Mask when Deku Link looks directly at you at shakes his head as if to say "Here we go again...".	Reddit, what are some of your favourite instances of a character breaking the fourth wall? This applies to anything from TV shows, movies, comics, etc.
17331	why is unemployment is calculated differently when a democrat is president?	So every previous jobs report stretching back before Obama took office is propaganda if it doesn't include the number of people who dropped out of the work force now? Because that's never been the custom when reporting this number. Also, it's not like the OP editorialized the title. It's the headline on the link word for word.
17332	I guess when you've been in the desert surrounded by people who want you dead, one little blonde CNN reporter isn't going to intimidate you.	He never wavered, it was glorious.
17333	Yay... All my mods broken again...	1.6 is now officially out!

17338	unlikely, they would be saying why didn't they win the league in december because spending everything is the only way..Wenger OUT!	If we would actually win the league with this team Wenger will be praised as the best manager ever, by everyone.
17339	We all know what a great track record in human rights the secular military has, right?	Incorrect, as most of us are secularists, meaning, any religion that takes power and attempts to introduce laws that favour one particular religion over another is truly evil and corrupt and should be brought down. Egypt's military is widely considered secular, that is the reason they are in favour on reddit. The military is definitely corrupt, but the Human Rights in the country are far better off with the military being in power, than having Islamic law introduced for all people to adhere to. Needless to say, there will still be massacres, unfairness and corruption. Western media wants the MB to have power and look innocent, so they can continue to give aid to Egypt, increasing debt, and a reason to continue selling them weapons and artillery
17340	Given that the Affordable Care Act was implemented in its cost-reducing entirety in 2009, this certainly seems like a major blow to the Obama administration's health care plan...	Premiums Climbed $2,976 Since 2009, Despite Obama's Vow Of $2,500 Cut

17345	People in turkey and brazil just don't have anything better to do than protest, our day to day is too busy and important	You know, I've been here a little while, maybe not as long as some hard core Redditors and I'm guilty of posting some lame meme's but this is beyond pointless. Firstly, you people (being UK, USA, Australia, etc) we have not and will still not continue to do anything about these abuses of peopleand power. Yeah you all talk a big talk on the internet, but when it comes to action, have any of you actually got up off your arse and taken to the streets, spoken to your politicians and demanded something be done, because I can't remember the last time anybody in a first world country stood up and made themselves heard. I'm not talking about one of two protesters, I'm talking in the thousands. Look at Turkey and Brazil right now, that's the kind of numbers we need! But then, and even then, will it still make a difference? These people get voted and put up into positions of power and reign over their country with an often unseen iron first and they will not change the constitution for hell nor high water. And will they let this man go free because you think he has done the right thing (which he has!) NO THEY WONT! They will hunt him down like a dog, relentlessly until they can have their moment in court. (or out of it???!?!?!?!) I hope for all our sake's and the sake of society this man could walk free and we could come to either an agreement of security measures or for getting PRISM pulled, but you and I both know this will not happen. STAY SAFE SNOWDEN. TL;DR: This will change nothing.
17346	Oh lookie here at mister moneybags	I'd pick Social and Good.
17347	They're all too busy in the Champion's League	No Spanish or German teams? Shit leagues.
17348	But... But... But... Socialism!	The Ryan Plan: Cutting Benefits For Poor Women To Protect Millionaires -- "Just as in past years, Paul Ryan has put forth a budget that rewards the rich with a huge tax break while cutting off opportunity and pathways out of poverty for women"
17349	Because the existence of richer people must mean that other people are poorer!	and poor people even like crazier
17350	But it's natural!	Yeah, this is the least hygenic thing I've seen in awhile. I wouldn't rub my bud into an open cut, and I damn sure wouldn't want anything from what is effectively an open wound getting into my bud. This made me want to throw up a little.
17351	Like "obfuscated"?	Because they don't know about the finance world and trust their "advisor" in the bank. Also, the bank obfuscated a lot of the documents with their fancy words.
17352	YES BURY THE CAPITALIST PIGS FOR GLORIOUS LEADER HAS DECLARED THAT WE MUST DO SO IN DEFENSE OF OUR MOTHERLAND	Its not North Korea that has gone to far but the US and south Korean regime. The US has thousands of nukes pointed at the DPRK and everyone seems fine with it but when a tiny nation tries to stand up to imperialism and the American capitalist system everyone loses their minds! The US has no business in Korea in the first place and if it wasn't for their imperial war 60 years ago the peninsula would be a united Korea. Yes, the people there have to make sacrifices, but it is what is necessary to resist empire. For those who complain about the Korean human rights record, that which isn't lies made up by the corporate media, the US is the greatest human rights violator in the history of the world. If they try to provoke something the US will get what it deserves if there happens to be a mushroom cloud over Los Angeles or San Francisco in addition to Tokyo and Seoul. Fucking scumbags.
17353	Because the federal worker is evil just like teachers etc...	How about we deal with the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are about to lose nearly 20 percent of their pay for the year due to furloughs? Surely that much money being kept from the economy is not going to help it improve.. two weeks until they start and I haven't heard one word about it from anything of the national media. Its absurd.
17354	I act like that When I gotta pee	Lady At Walmart Tripping On Meth
17355	May.	When will the April System Update come out? It's almost halfway through the month and no update :/ I was hoping they would release it early April but, it doesn't seem like it. Did Nintendo ever announce the date they would release the update?
17356	DON'T LET GAYS DEFILE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM!	I was in the boy scouts for years and never saw anyone naked. I did see naked boys every day at school during PE though. What are you afraid of exactly?
17357	wait, theres no one named anything close to camel...	It's taken me 10 years but I finally understand the Spongebob Squarepants metaphor

17365	Filthy console peasants!	Dorkly demonstrates many of my relationships' fights. (Replace Xbox with PC)
17366	Shave the inside of your nose, you totally don't need those hairs in there!	This is borderline horrifying. Rachel Money urges women to shave their peach fuzz because "your husband and/or boyfriend is secretly pissed off that you have a mustache."
17367	Yeah screw diversity, starcraft isnt big enough for multiple casting crews.	2gdstudio should be present at every event in Europe + iNcontrol, khaldor, TLO. Tastosis have had their time, time for a refreshing change ...and ofcourse day9aswell..
17368	Well, that question seems perfectly unbiased and doesn't generally lend itself towards one result	The question asked is here Do you feel President Obama should: (ORDER ROTATED) - Respect the medical marijuana laws in these states, or - Use federal resources to arrest and prosecute individuals who are acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws?
17369	Yeah, that McDojo Gracie Barra with all of their McMedals at International McTournaments.	How do you feel about Carlos Jr. and Gracie Barra? Not trolling, I go to one but read here on Reddit that it's just a McDojo and I want to hear about how Royce feels about it. Oh, and I went to one of his seminars 7 years ago. :)
17370	Great business plan, banks will be falling over themselves for his signature	Btw, I should mention that by "company" what I mean is that he's a 19 year old kid who just graduated high school, is working at McDonald's, and wants to start a skateboard company because "white people pay big money for some wood on wheels" as he put it.
17371	No, we all hate asoiaf in this subreddit.	AFFC has been a struggle but ASOS was one of the best books I ever read. Should I continue?
17372	well look at mr fancy pants	It's not a sticker, its the Ray-Ban logo etched on to the glass. If you owned a pair of Ray-Ban's then you wouldn't really want it to come off anyways though, because one of the primary reasons to buy Ray-Bans instead of generic wayfarer is to show off to everyone that you can afford to buy Ray-Bans.

17373	As a Cyber Monday deal, do you ever get jealous that people ignore you 364 days of the year?	Cyber Monday Deals Cyber Monday deals, get informed on where you can find some great deals this week! Forget about waiting in massive lines, black Friday is for the foolish masses.
17374	I'm so glad that the UN has seen fit to grant us some human rights...	December 10th is Human Rights Day
17375	Space dolphins, money well spent I say	TIL Doug Michaels wanted to build a water filled space station to house only a population of dolphins
17376	For sure, that guy messaged 10 of his friends to stage this play for the sweet karma	Fake
17377	Right, this would really give the game that extra something special it's currently missing, fingers crossed for release day	[VVGH] Duh herro!

17379	Try small business owner who just hired someone who is willing to pay his dues.	Nice try, hedge fund manager.
17380	You gotta admit our conservatives/Republicans are devilishly clever.	Holy fuck, what's next? We just start busting people for possessing pot and then take them straight to and auction block?
17381	*Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.	Which shows did you expect to hate but actually ended up loving? I was sure Downton Abbey would be rubbish - it's on a bad channel in the UK (ITV) and I don't really like period dramas. But wow, it really surprised me and I'd rate it up there in my favourite shows - it balances drama and humour in a perfect way, and the characters (in first two seasons at least) are beautifully written, at least with the sheer number of them. It also looks great too. Others: Seinfeld (hate laughter tracks but this is obviously so well written), Jersey Shore (first season anyway, it's so bad but a fascinating character study before they become self aware) and Go On (don't like actress Jo Brand generally but its an interesting look at British hospitals). In fact, most of Adult Swim's shows too (Aqua Team, Squidbillies..). So what shows did you start but expect to hate, and then end up following and rating highly?
17382	So... what do they do on a Friday night?	Found the vegan!
17383	Well, if you didn't find cutting zombies in half with saw blades immensely satisfying, I don't know what to say.	yes, I'm up to the part where you have to drive past these sandcrabs, and then take on a load of soldiers.
17384	We got blown out from the start all the way to the finish.	I miss that game, what happened?
17385	Even then expect them to stab you in the back as soon as it becomes advantageous.	People are generally too self involved to give a shit these days. Unless you're good friends with your coworkers, you'll probably never hear from any of them again.
17386	Using the word "comedian" preeeeeeeetty loosely here.	No this is the most annoying comedian. Make it stop!
17387	Day trade every move up or down like a worn out alcoholic at the slots.	If you're using the same analysis as everyone else, how can you expect to outperform the herd if you're trained to be in it?
17388	As of right now, I'll have to say Non Non Biyoris OP just fills me with joy every time i hear it...	What's your favorite anime opening? So far one of my favorite anime OP is Angel Beats! but for this anime season it would have to the second OP of Attack on Titan.
17389	Because FICA is not federal income tax and is not meant to pay off any treasuries at all.	Why?
17390	Hes totally into you.	My best friend is awesome
17391	They can contact you via Redditgifts and you can reply to them, but I don't think you can message them first.	Is there any way to contact my SS? As the title asks. As of now there is no need but if something arises is there a way? This is my first SS on reddit.
17392	I guess the entirety of the population of millions on reddit are actually just one person being a dick to himself.	I guess Reddit thinks everyone should be flipping burgers and the people who take low-income/dangerous professions to make a difference in this world are stupid.
17393	This is Arcade.	Working as intended!
17394	and if they cant protect a child long enough to defend itself the genetic line ends, hence selection	... no, the fact that they bred meant they were selected for.
17395	I understand that what I'm talking saying is though that it was James VI of Scotland who got the ball rolling even if he was wearing his king of England hat.	Elizabeth I saw a tentative start on the empire in what is now Virginia. However, James I/VI did it with his "King of England" hat on, which has nothing to do with his being Scottish. They were separate until 1707 but after the Restoration, tended to be pretty aligned anyway
17396	How about Chipper Jones since every other player up there is no longer active?	I vote to remove Pujols and insert Francoeur... and while you're at it might as well not wait 7 more years for this decade, go ahead and stick Puig up there.
17397	But guys this is just Islamic culture, you have no right to insult it, that would be racist and islamaphobic.

17398	So...insignificant...	My boyfriend didn't keep his promise. My SO decided he didn't want to go on the date we had been planning for over a week because he was too tired. He was too tired because he had stayed up late redditing and playing games. If you're reading this, I drank the last of your chocolate milk. It was delicious.

17401	God forward assists are so pointless...I always like people that smack them after they load a round...its fun to watch people monkey with them.	No forward assist? I like that.
17402	I find this oppinion highly controversial	Do you REALLY want an unpopular opinion?????
17403	You think you're some Fiat cat around here?	Do you want to hear about my car? Nevermind, it's kind of a Saab story.
17404	I'm guessing a bigger number stencil had to be used to cover up a mistake during the painting.	Why is that one number 3 so big compared to the other numbers?
17405	Often the posts between doors are removable, and there's also usually some kind of loading bay.	I've always wondered how they get them in the mall. Once all the carts are out of the way, there's obviously room inside to drive it to the spot, but no malls I've been to have doors wider than a double-French. Do the frames lift up or something?
17406	At some point they have to decide what kind of country they want to be, and I think this is a good first step.	Gaddafi killer faces prosecution
17407	If there's anything libertarians love, it's giving away their hard-earned money for the benefit of losers who don't deserve it.	Libertarian thinks the argument against charity in favor of government programs is bunk because he donates $1000 a year to charities.
17408	And he was also in love with a man named Antinous, hence my name :)	TIL Hadrian, Roman emperor from 117 AD to 138 AD, banned circumcision because the Romans (and Greeks) considered it a form of body mutilation, and hence barbaric.
17409	What was his excuse for that douchebag move?	(Language and volume warning) Stupid simple accident.
17410	He's such a nice guy that he wants to let you know exactly how he's wooing you.	I know! He's trying to manipulate the situation but he's telling me how he's doing it, which is the total opposite purpose of manipulating someone.
17411	yup, because all men are looking for fragile females who they can take care of and protect...	I hope you're not alone but if you are this is why.
17412	People who talk the longest about themselves and how great they are are usually being 100% honest.	Ever see an interview with him? He can go on for hours about that stuff. Tarantino's immaculate attention to detail annoys some people yet impresses others. It's clear he leaves very little out with respect to his vision for how a scene should look and be shot.
17413		thanks Democrats.
17414	Get your dirty, disgusting logic out of here!	Is that really the point of youth football? If they are the best players available for the first team that's where they belong.

17417	Hey, whatever makes you feel better about losing the argument, sug.	You have to have a point to begin with for it to be dismissed.

17421	The same guy that tweeted saying it ran at 720p tweeted later saying that at release it won't be 720p, I think.	Source? I'm not saying I disagree or agree with you. I'm just curious a to why you would say that.
17422	Well that will show them!	"Enjoy nature". Which means smoke weed and have a drum circle, knowing her.
17423	Everyone knows that school buses, milk trucks, and hybrid cars are what tears up our roads!	Here's an idea: why don't states make trucks pay more? They are responsible for the vast majority of wear and tear on our roads.
17424	First time I've ever read something stupid at WSJ.	Bad journalism at work: Bigger displays use more bandwidth, WSJ blogs
17425	something something freindzoned something	So you're saying Nice guys are onto something after all?
17426	It could very well just be one of those words like "guttural" that people seem to use without any real meaning other than "this sounds different and I don't like it."	Why do people often label dialects/languages other than their own as being 'nasal'?
17427	Sadly with 3 children under 3 and a 9-5 job my time is fairly limited beyond those I touch directly but who knows down the road.	Philanthropy
17428	I dunno if it has changed now, but when I took those classes a D was all you needed to take the next one except for calc 1.	D in a pre-req So I'm probably going to end up with a d in calc-142, I'm wondering if anyone has had luck with petitioning their instructor to take the next course in a series where a c- is required. I'm going to show serious improvement in my final and will know the material. Any advice?

17430	Population is bit dense in this area of Maryland to be shooting these things... just saying.	I would imagine it would be more effective to use frangible ammunition to shoot them out from any distance. Those cameras are not cheap, and the city cannot afford to just keep replacing them over, and over, and over. Eventually they would have to give up.
17431	Penn state didnt stumble too much against us....	Conversely, which teams that aren't gaining much attention could overachieve / make some serious noise this year? I think a combination of losing some key seniors (Notably McGloin, Mauti, Hodges, Zordich, Hill), already reducing scholarship players to 67 and being under a bowl ban for three more years leaves most people not caring how Penn State performs. I understand that the new quarterback, whether it's Ferguson or Hackenberg, has a lot of work ahead of himself. However, I think it's plausible for Penn State to go 9-3 this season if they don't stumble out of the gate like they did last year. Given the circumstances, that would be a tremendous season.
17432	Nah.	can we not put a million fuckin tags on one post trying to be funny Like one is ok like [HOUSTON RAP] but don't be like [HOUSTON RAP] [THIS SHIT SLAPS] [LOVE THE HOOK] [WE REALLY OUTCHEA] It's annoying as fuck

17438	Maybe its from all the english movies he watches.	To be honest the main reason I suspected it as satire is because even though I know people like this exist, the ones I know of don't actually type in English this good.
17439	No, just sounds like a nice BDSM style game.	sounds an awful lot like rape

17441	I guess I will start taking your economic views a little more seriously after you have won your first Nobel Prize in economics.	No, the story is that Krugman isn't a reliable source, since everything he advocates advances ONLY a Democrat Party objective.
17442	Oh man Obama is sooo cool, I don't even care that he wouldn't think twice to put me in prison for smoking weed	If I was President Obama....
17443	I have no idea how I survived so long without a gun.	Firearms for self defense is not about killing, contrary to overwhelmingly popular belief. It is for *stopping* a threat immediately. You can not threaten anyone if you are critically wounded or dead. It doesn't matter - the threat you were causing is now stopped. Firearm is the most effective tool on the entire planet to stop attacking humans and animals from safe distance.

17449	I don't know, Mazzarri would have been the perfect fit.	Thankfully our management were able to keep him here. We would be screwed if he left.
17450	that would totally help the economy	Can you imagine if people saw all their taxes thrown on sales tax? (the only way I can think of to do away with the IRS). 3 dollar candybar and 3 dollar sales tax would open some eyes!

17463	"Not really our problem" you're a credit to our profession.	Not really our problem. Most of the important stuff is restored in the image and everything else isn't local so they won't lose contacts etc. Witha good restore process there should be very little of substance to do after. When you have 100 things going on making sure a user doesn't lose their wall paper or their icons really doesn't register
17464	Yes, because my regular garage clearly suffers from this problem.	Exhaust fumes, exhaust fumes everywhere.
17465	Are you saying that major Hollywood movies *aren't* how most disclosures of Earth shattering information are released?	Sounds legit. Of all places for this to be posted... If this was real, why wouldn't it have gone straight to news media? Why does it get an announcement before release? Wouldn't the government "men in black" hush it up, and kill those with knowledge? You people seriously believe this?

17471	Gladly, you don't even have a ranged weapon equipped n00b huntard!	Come At Me Ret Pallies, DKs, Warriors
17472	A+ would read again.	It seems a lot of racism comes from a culture war narrative. As black people become more capable of competing for stuff while still being significantly "other" in our cultural canon, certain racist memes come to the forefront. Most of the stuff I've seen from when black people were disempowered enough to not appear threatening in an economic and cultural sense, characterized them as silly, incompetent and sweet-natured. When black people started showing up in the same fields and institutions as white people, it seems they became increasingly characterized as lazy, violent, and degenerate (usually with the words "their culture" attached, but I don't really think that makes it any less an uniformed and somewhat selfish assessment.) So, I don't know, I'm not surprised that old slaveholders would be less racist in some ways than people who have to rationalize their anxiety about facing black people as equals.
17473	Because he's definitely not just making a joke.	This is why our country is lost in economic downfall, because some people vote based on superficial bullshit. I know others that had even more stupid reasons for choosing Obama, but some on this list were also mentioned when they were trying to justify their choice.
17474	Yes we are way worse and unsportsman-like than anyother NFL fans, Oakland for instance.	Who gives a shit if you're frustrated? What are you, a city full of children?

Nowhere in it can you cite that statement, and the fact you think Jesus wrote the Bible (the exact opposite is true, he write none of it)...
17494	Yeah let's just pile on more debt and print more money, that'll solve everything.	The Third Depression
17495	Glad to see your logic at work here.	This logic escapes the American gun nut. It is like talking to a wall when you bring up how much safer people are without so many guns in so many hands. They don't wan to hear it. Their arguments all boil down to one thing: they're basically "pro-death". In other words, they're lunatics.
17496	Sounds reasonable....	all three of these inbreds need to be chemically castrated..then subjected to Scaphism
17497	Cause what the world really needs is more people passionate about their belief structures.	I certainly am not critical of your beliefs because they are not extreme enough. Neither do I have any problem with agnosticism- most people here (myself included) consider themselves agnostic; after all, its a simple question. My issue is with those who use the term "agnostic" as a more politically-correct way of identifying themselves as atheists. I agree, that both the theist and atheist gnostic positions are inconsistent given the usual, vague definition of God. My issue with your argument is that it is even more inconsistent than gnosticism. On the one hand, you acknowledge that rationally, the likelihood of a god's existence is no different than the likelihood of other mythical beings existing. Yet, you believe that the God concept deserves more consideration because *society takes it more seriously*. Your argument has nothing to do with the actual question of existence and everything to do with the society in which you were raised. If you were born and raised around those who worshiped Santa, you would similarly argue that this idea was more worthy of consideration because more people held stock in it. If you really believed there was some credence to the idea of God, I could respect your position- but you don't. You admit it is no different philosophically from other supernatural claims. I don't like the hypocrisy. If an adult makes the claim that Santa is real, society will label them as crazy (unlike a mere theist). I totally disagree with this labeling- aside from being nonconformist, they are exactly as crazy as a theist. The view you are espousing is one of casual rationality, where only views already outside of the mainstream are challenged. It is much easier to get by like this, because you respect the average person's views merely because they are common. Now, I don't go around debating theists, nor do I criticize them (naturally, I try to keep religion out of the conversation when theists are around). I know that their views are an understandable consequence of social dynamics. But it doesn't make their views any more rational, or defensible, than the ravings of a lunatic.
17498	Yeah, 'cause you might get into an accident and paralyze yoursel... oh.	That thing needs a seatbelt.

17500	45 minutes my ass, really, my colon tells me when it's go time caffeine is the igniter and raisin bran is the explosive.	Little known facts about your coffee: It takes 45 minutes to take real effect and the half-life of the caffeine is 5 hours. So don't expect to wake up in 2 minutes and be very careful about drinking coffee during the day and evening unless you want to sleep with lots of caffeine in your blood.
17501	Oh look, more stupid vapid shit on reddit.	There was a complaint on reddit earlier that adviceanimals were becoming too specific, so without further adieu I present to you: Inappropriate sexual inuendo dog that dresses and talks like a pirate.
17502	Its a bit more complicated than that article describes but thats the basic idea.	TIL the origins of Seventh Day Adventists.
17503	I suggest you get some advice from somewhere other than Reddit.	Reddit, I have $30,000 to invest it and I want to make a quick buck and I would be willing to watch my money closely, what do you recommend? Reddit, I have inherited $30,000 from my father's best friend. I graduated from college a few months ago and I have no debt. Is it stupid if I invested all my money in the stock market for a quick buck? I would like something that has a high rate of return, but I am not experienced/newbie. What would you folks recommend and why?
17504	It's not a logical fallacy, it's a theory contradicted by facts.	If you've looked around MensRights long, you'll find that they consider the definition of feminism to be misandry, and that it's OUR logical fallacy when we say that misandry is not true feminism. I'll probably be downvoted into oblivion, but that has been my overwhelming experience.
17505	I, too, am stunned by photographs with too much green tint.	I think this photo is stunning, what about you?
17506	Yeah, but cats are cute!	From what I'm reading here, the most horrific things redditors have seen are animals being killed. That is pretty tame. How many dead animals do you eat everyday? Or see eaten every day? Granted, I have not seen anything very very bad before, but I can realize that the things I have seen are not that bad. And are in fact, the harsh reality of life. My definition of very disgusting would be something like prolonged torture or suffering. Not the drowning or instantaneous killing of a kitten. Especially if you witness it as a child. The memory is intensified since it was possibly the first semi-violent thing you ever saw. And don't scold me and say that it was totally violent and harsh. It wasn't. A murder involving someone being stabbed 40 times before they die is violent.
17507	good enough for me	An in-depth response by Metro about whether if bag searches will be effective.
17508	Very helpful	Dont buy macbook pros... they are expensive. Next time buy a Dell for $600 and you would have the money.
17509	Yeah, I'm glad you clarified that in your initial statement instead of just rambling wildly	I don't hate the police. The santa clara police department has shittons of complaints. When you get ticketed AFTER the guy ASKS if you're married and he LIES about how fast you are going which increases the fine by a couple hundred then I want to see how fuzzy you feel about it.
17510	Statistics: *you* can spot the lucky numbers too!	Our brain is really good at seeing patterns where there are none, just another reason why basic statistics training should be mandatory.
17511	What a wonderful example of coincidence!	I would like to start a vigilante group who kidnaps and tortures anyone who publicly advocates that torture is acceptable. I feel that if they are embracing torture publicly, they should experience the same thing they want others to experience. Maybe their opinion on the acceptability of torture will change having been tortured themselves. Who's with me?
17512	How much is the interest rate, if i keep it on my wallet?	we've all been given 1,000 aurum, apparently which buys some boots, or whatever. as I currently have station environment turned off, I have no interest in buying clothing. I thought maybe I could convert this free gift into cold hard ISK. except it's not going to work, is it? I figure, if I buy the boots and put them in the market (going for about 20 million in Essence), everyone else will likely do something similar, and the price will go down, and I'll end up getting like 3 million for 1000 aurum. seems low. also, nobody will want to buy any items on the market because if they do want some boots, *they just got 1,000 aurum for free as well*. Unless it's per account, not per character. I haven't tried logging in my alts yet. anyway -- I guess I should just hold on to this shit until such a time as something better comes up, right?

17514	Right now, 3: Front door, downstairs door, garage door.	How many keys do you carry with you at all times? Also, do you carry decoy keys, or keys that you have no idea how the fuck they got on your keyring?
17515	I would appear to be the only person on reddit who hates marshmallows and can't stand to have them pass my lips.	Yes, yes that is exactly like happiness!
17516	Douchebag baby.	Baby, can you get me a beer?
17517	Yep just got booted off of a game.	Did ea authentication just go down? Well did it? or is just me?
17518	Guess his children shouldn't have been terrorists then.	that depends on your definition of "good side." If you're a father who's children have been killed by a drone attack in Iraq, clearly you'd speak differently
17519	...but Kenya is predominantly a Christian country.	That Obama is a muslim terrorist.
17520	Uhh, Patriot Act for one.	The American people are too smart to let such people change their laws and policies toward a more controlled society.
17521	Yeah - who the hell is he and what does he have to do with Wikipedia?	obviously this goes towards recruiting a less creepy figurehead for wikipedia. why else would they plaster that creepy Wales fellow onto (almost) every page if not to remind people of this?
17522	I am asking reddit admins to add page numbers to make it more convenient to browse...	How in GODS name did you possibly think this belonged in AskReddit?
17523	Because of all of the "green shoots".	How is this unexpected?
17524	I agree, the idea that God created a universe with 100 billion galaxies just for us is much less humble.	Could this "ClimateGate" issue become the chink in Science's unasailable armour, that allows us to be more humble about our role on Earth, and not trust so blindly in the absolute "Truth" that Science and Technology has come to represent to most of us in our Modern Society?
17525	But I KNOW Pelosi was not informed!	Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rice were present in meetings where sexual humiliation was discussed as policy

17528	Unfortunately for George, his show is terrible and I don't think any other networks are going to be tripping over themselves to sign him.	Except from the first sentence, I almost thought you pasted in Conan and Leno with Lopez and Conan there. Lopez should have stood up for himself and moved to another network and kick another guy out.

17533	It could *never* happen in America.	Think Guantanamo is bad? TIL we have two secret prisons for Muslims and environmentalists that are basically "Guantanamo in the US". Obama changed the rules to allow more people to be sent there.
17534	Do I hear Donald Trump?	The only real hope a third party candidate has is to be some sort of billionaire who can self-finance a huge campaign, and even then, the easier route would just be to try and win a primary.
17535	These two facts are entirely unrelated, how dare you suggest one group getting richer while another can no longer feed their children is in any way related!	The number of Americans living in poverty is ballooning, along with the number of mllionaires.
17536	I didn't know that 10012010 was a binary number.	Today's date is 38 in binary or 26 if you're from Europe. That is all.
17537	Who could possibly get upset over someone touching their genitals?	I'm not really all that bothered by the airport procedures. It probably takes too long and is too paranoid. But it's not worth getting upset about.
17538	So... he liked it?	Zero Punctuation - Castlevania: Lord of Shadow
17539	You need new friends.	Sadly I do not have friends I can share my scotch with. They either want to put coke in it, or think it tastes terrible.

17541	Willingness to give blowjobs.	what supersedes physical attractiveness to you? When checking someone out with whom you've never spoken, I think looks play a pretty big role. But there are a few things besides your hair/physique/clothes that will completely supersede that for me. If I see someone reading or carrying a book for instance, I immediately judge them off of that before I consider their physical hotness. So what is it for the rest of reddit?
17542	You are a tall man.	I'm 6'10", and she's 4'9". Win.
17543	Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.	If teachers' unions are the biggest obstacle to improving student achievement, then why are the states without teacher contracts among the worst performing in the nation?

17546	I think you mean clips, and frankly they should be called assault clips, because the only reason you need more than one, is if you plan to kill people.	What gun magazines to buy? I see a bunch on the shelves, but they seem to just be Ads for new guns coming out. I used to get american rifleman when I was a NRA member and that had some helpful tips in it, but too much political parts for my tastes. What magazine offers sound tips and advice for new and learning shooters?

17549	I didn't watch any episodes after the first one and now I'm glad I didn't because the finale really sucked and didn't answer any of my questions.	I don't know, but the fact that they didn't answer that question ruins the show's entire six seasons.

17551	Yes, exactly that, only with a different meaning and different words.	So what you're saying is that the only people "cut out for relationships" are the people who do them like you? I love poly relationships; I hate poly elitism.
17552	Wait, they "let" him be a rock star in exchange for only taking 95% of the money... I still see why most jump at that, they think being famous is worth something when its not and record companies know fame is fleeting but money is forever.	Trent Reznor: "Biggest wake-up calls of my career was when I saw a record contract. I said, 'Wait - you sell it for $18.98 and I make 80 cents? And I have to pay you back the money you lent me to make it and then you own it?"
17553	I vote for meeting you!	I vote for somewhere that serves beer!

17561	Our hero!	I still wouldn't feel right letting people be helpless at the hands of their assaulters. I'll take the chances of those with less training defending themselves (holding them accountable if they hurt others unjustly) than being solely dependent upon others to react after the event rather than nullifying it.
17562	National Guardsmen performing *domestic* civil service, that preposterous!	Bring the troops home. Use soldiers to clean up the mess BP made. (I'm absolutely serious. That's what other countries use their troops for, too.)
17563	Oh *yes*, this inflammatory stuff *really* contributes to the *dialogue*.	Tell it like it is, a crazy vet with a few screws loose in his head got shot, not the Marines. This is the exact reason USMC don't alllow its personel participating in protests in uniform. If you think you have it bad with the police, you people have no idea, if the Marines were called to disperse the protesters it would be so quick and brutal that only 4 hours later nobody would remember a protest took place there.

17573	that's interesting that you know so much about the inner workings of her marriage from just 3 sentences.	Actually I do. Honey -- you need to explore life outside of a relationship. Remember what Sting tells us: *If you love somebody - set them free.* Well if your Fiancee (a guy who found you to be a peer when he was 18 and you were 14 - what's that say about him?) really loved you -- he'd set you free. How it's supposed to work is that you go off as an individual and develop self unattached to a couple or identity as part of a couple.... then when you finally become a couple you have more self to give to it thereby creating a better stronger and more rich relationship.

17578	What you need to do is determine when they are sleeping, and then crank up your music to keep them awake.	My neighbors continually play loud music, I'm studying for finals. Reddit, what should I do about this situation? I'm talking wall shaking, glass rattling sound here, not the typical scenario where the music is a bit too loud. The obvious answer is confront the neighbors, however, since about 8 dudes live there this solution generates a certain amount of trepidation for me. I'm looking for creative ideas to squelch the noise problem. Thanks! P.S. The are you human validation gave me these letters. KCFMOR which easily rearrange themselves into MOR KFC. Is this subtle advertising on the part of Reddit or am I just hungry?
17579	I would replace Republican with Conservative.	tl:dr Obama is a republican and has been a bit shit.

17582	Yeah, Indy was a lot more interested in absconding with other nations' cultural treasures than he was in melting them.	Yeah it always bothered me that Waterhouse was in essence a destroyer of ancient cultural relics. Indy would kick his ass for that.
17583	So your saying we should work 4, 12 hour days then?	Exactly! So many of us are working extra unpaid hours. A 4 day week may be a good way to address this and deliver a range of other benefits back to the nation at the same time.
17584	Obligatory post about Tyler Seguin only being 19 and the world should be outraged.	Photos from the Boston Bruins' $156,000 Stanley Cup party.

17586	Women know their place	what?! i don't believe that.
17587	The alternative is that we are supporting terrorists, and we don't want to support terrorists do we?	I don't understand this. Who in the US is really pro-Israel? Most Americans either don't have an opinion on Israel, or would prefer to stop aiding Israel. It's the lobbies that keep the US funding Israel, not the American people.
17588	yeah, ike that's the first thing we'd all do when we get out	And with that money you could start your own hip hop label.

17593	Let political correctness prevail.	How would you define race or racism? I had a take home test for my race and the law class recently with this as a question. The test has been turned in nearly two weeks, but I still am thinking about this question. Reddit I curse you with this question because I want to know the thoughts you guys have. My definition was that race was a immoral but rational construct designed to allow the exploitation of a weaker group by convincing non inquiring minds skin color was more important than humanity, pretty much.
17594	Benny Hinn - because let's face it, people get diseases, and need to be rid of those diseases.	Whos your favourite scientist of all time? For me it has got to be Nicola Tesla - the guy was a genius who practically invented many of the great technological things we take for granted in everyday life, not to mention he is one of the more relatively unknown characters to the general public and deserves more acclaim

17604	It's not as good as it used to be, but still better than Digg, etc.	What's new, Reddit? I've been at uni for eight months: in which time, I've only had time to dip into Reddit now and again. What have I missed? New memes, users to keep an eye out for, the current view of the hivemind, etc., etc...
17605	historians came to a consensus on something?	I hope the phrase 'smartest president we'd ever had in the 20th century' is the 'we'd ever had' portion correctly, because yes, he may have been up until that point. However, if you meant 'we've ever had,' you may be off-base. Clinton was remarkably intelligent and historians' consensus is that Clinton was the smartest president we have *ever* had.
17606	however.... larger ones do have a positive economic effect.	Your example is somewhat flawed, crooked teeth can actually have adverse health effects (inability to clean them properly) and make chewing certain foods difficult. I didn't wear my retainer after getting mine removed and now my front teeth are slightly out of line. Biting anything anything even remotely tough like steak is a gargantuan pain in the ass. Whereas I don't think anyone has had difficulty feeding their children with ugly boobies. [/nitpick]

17610	I don't know but I can see whose the fattest.	Who's the strongest boy in school?
17611	You would hope that.	I think they are really arguing about semantics... It seems like the taxi drivers are being told to profile more along the lines of demeanor/appearance (ie - sagged pants, disheveled etc) rather than along racial lines. It really comes down to that. If they are accepting white passengers in the same situations where they were not accepting black or latino passengers, then it is racial profiling. However, if they are simply refusing people (of any race) along non-racial lines (clothing etc) then it is simply profiling, and logical profiling at that. I dont agree with doing it along racial lines, but I can see the idea behind refusing service to people who clearly belong in a risky demographic (younger, "thugish" appearing types) independent of race.
17612	You would probably download it anyway.	Well then I will not be purchasing your book.
17613	But if that money is going into someone's pocket, then it is stimulating the economy!	I don't think you understand that "cost" doesn't mean the money is literally burned. It is going straight into someone's pockets, and look at that steady increase!
17614	linkin park and 50 cent make frag videos awesome	Why does everyone who submits videos to Youtube feel the need to put a heavy metal soundtrack over the top of even the most mundane things?
17615	But the bible says you shouldn't rape and murder, and so do our laws, so the causality is obvious!	All this crap about American Legal system being based on the Ten Commandments. It's worth pointing out that Anglo-Saxon Law, the basis for English and later American Law is based upon Roman Law. The very same Roman Law that crucified their Jebus.
17616	Damn Canadians.	Reddit, how does Corey Haim's mother's 911 phone call get released to the public?

They changed her duty station last minute, not sure why, to Fort Drum NY. Is this normal? We were not financially preparing for this. We are kind of scrambling to catch up.

17642	No, you'll just be throwing your vote away.	It took an INDEPENDENT politician to stand up for 98% of the American people. Should we now seriously consider a wider range of political parties? If nothing else, it seems that the Democrats and the Republicans are far too invested in protectionism and self-survival to be able to represent their constituents effectively. The culture of corruption (earmarks, lobbying, and payoffs) has shown to be too ingrained in these two parties for any politician who seeks their support to be able to act with integrity and in the interests of the people they represent. Does Bernie Sanders actions demonstrate the need for the majority of the American people to look outside the current two-party system in choosing their elected officials?

17648	Well you know the caps are justified because Cisco charges royalty fees for every packet that passes over the router.	Speed does not mean much if there is a "data cap". I am currently on a 25/10 service from Bell here in Canada. The speed is great and consistent. Our cap is 75GB Because I use Netflix to let my daughter watch shows I have ended up with bills in excess of 100/month. I recently signed up for an extra 50GB for $20 but I don't see how that will cut it. Basically - Bandwidth with low caps is shit.
17649	Or maybe it's just a cigar.	This is a great movie. I took a communications class in college where we dissected the themes and symbolism of the film. If you get it due credit, it's actually a very deep film about humanity's desire to fulfill some unknown purpose.

17651	Yeah, and Scott Walkers campaign pitch was about abolishing collective bargaining right of workers.	It's not trickery, it's not fascism. It is the embodiment of representative democracy. Elections have consequences, majority vote passes laws. If people had gone out and voted during the last election, they wouldn't be in this mess. That was when this battle was really fought.
17652	Agreed, another X-mormon here.	No worries. If I hadn't grown up Mormon, I'd probably reflexively downvote me, too. That Mormonism merits little more than an *eye roll* and a *meh* from most folks is understandable ... but for those of us who've broken free, we tend to relish our ex-mormon status and our new-found freedoms (of thought and action) and so it goes.

17666	well, you act like one...	Oh yeah?...Oh yeah?!.. Well just cuz your OS can do threads it doesn't mean it knows what to do with them! Seriously, your process of discerning merit in technology is flawed and susceptible to outside influences. Read the articles, read the source, then decide for yourself. You are aware that, currently, to be able to truly evaluate GCD you will have to actually use a Mac? So you can easily dismiss any informed opinions as a 'mac fanatic'. I recommend Tylenol for all your thread related headaches. My point is no library will solve your problems, you can just try to choose something you're productive with and allows you to work on worthwhile problems.
17667	I'm surprised you gave her a ride home.	Did I overreact or am I right? I'm 26, she's 25, we've been together for 2.5 years now and everything seemed to be going great until last night. But first a little introduction: About 2 weeks ago, a new colleague started working at the same place my girlfriend works. She's been working there for about a year and she always had co-workers coming and going, talking to me about them, how she gets along with some and not so well with others, the usual "how-was-your-day" talk. I've never been the jealous type and always offered her complete freedom and never questioned her trust, even though her co-workers are mostly guys. We actually mock the boyfriends who are overprotective of their girlfriends and don't allow them to do something or get upset even if she would be talking to some other guy. Well, fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she gets this new colleague and as usual she starts telling me about him. How smart he is, how well they get along, what great talks they have etc and I am genuinely happy for her that she finally has someone to talk to and make the day easier on her. So, I make nothing of it, and things go great while she keeps telling me how great that guy is. To be honest, I got a little jealous (who wouldn't?) but I didn't let it show and I was angry on myself for feeling jealous, afteral, there's nothing going on between them and I shouldn't feel this way. Then 2 days ago, I call her at work, as I usually do, to chit-chat in her break, and she tells me that she just came back from a walk in the park with a girl-colleague of her, I say "cool" and she says "oh, and also the new guy came with us". I got a little suspicious here, not because he went along with them, but because she mentioned him coming with them at the last moment, somehow like she "forgot" that he was even there. But I tell myself that it's the jealous guy talking inside me and I'm just over analyzing it. So, yesterday, I go to pick her up from work, as I always do, but I forget my phone to call her when to come out. I swear, and I know it might not be believable, but I actually forgot my phone. So, since I can't call her to come out, I go inside to pick her up and there she is, sitting in this guy's lap with her arms around his neck and his hands around her. If I didn't know any better I would say they are definitely together. She jumps up from the chair and from his lap and with this scared look on her face and shaky voice tells me "why didn't you call?". I tell her I forgot my phone and that I'll be waiting outside. At this point my heart is racing and I'm furious, I feel betrayed and I consider that she stepped out of line. I don't know if for some this type of thing is acceptable in a relationship, but that doesn't even matter. I just try to picture myself with a girl on my lap, her arms crossed around my neck, and ask myself if I would do that, if I would consider it out of line, and the answer comes easily to me: No, I would never hold another girl like that while I have a girlfriend. So, she comes out, we go home, and I calmly explain to her that what she did was out of line and that I feel betrayed and that we should take a break. So, my question is, did I overreact, did I over analyze the whole thing, am I in the wrong, is it just the jealousy in me talking? Right now I am between extreme sadness and extreme feeling of betrayal, I don't even know how to describe it.
17668	Yeah geothermal is GREAT for making plastic/etc	Solar, wind, hydro and geothermal. This oil bullshit is pissing me off.
17669	TIL AES works by changing the background colour to the same colour as the text.	In other news, Skype uses RC4, a cryptographic algorithm with known weaknesses. (It's possible to use RC4 securely--at least somewhat securely--but it's still risky nonetheless.) Incorrect usage of RC4 was a major reason why WEP was cracked so easily. At least their other servers use AES-256, which is approved by the NSA for encrypting "top secret" documents.
17670	I know man, no ones should be allowed to vote on things I disagree with	Seriously, why is stuff like this even up to a vote? You shouldn't be able to vote against freedom and equality.

17672	Except Ron Paul he is the the only honest politician in the world	Why do you continue to believe what politicians say? They're going to say whatever people want to hear just to get elected. After they are, it's back to the same old game, be it republican or democrat. Obama supports whoever supports him, just like the rest of them.
17673	TIL I am hardcore	Arduino and c++ is hardcore?

17675	but "anything will be better than this tyrant" is all I hear on NPR, so it must be true.	Amidst the current events taking place in Libya, I can't help but think of this quote: "No revolution, no matter how justified, and no movement, no matter how popular, has ever succeeded without a political philosophy to guide it, to set its direction and goal. A majority without an ideology is a helpless mob, to be taken over by anyone." -Ayn Rand, 1962.

17678	100 times this!	If your not interested in learning how to become a website designer/builder/programmer, your best bet will be to use a Content Management System (CMS). Something like Wordpress if you want simple and easy or Drupal if you want powerful and complex. This way you can focus on your content and not have to worry so much about coding.
17679	I had the same thing happen to me, but I was wise to their ways.	Well played, Wordpress. Well played indeed.
17680	Famous Blue Raincoat covered by Tori Amos hits me like a ton of bricks	"Shouldering your loneliness/Like a gun that you will not learn to aim/You stumble into this movie house/Then you climb, you climb into the frame/Yes, and here, right here/Between the moonlight and the lane/Between the tunnel and the train/Between the victim and his stain/Once again, once again/Love calls you by your name." One thing I really love about Leonard Cohen is that he can write these lyrics that just hit you so hard. Hell, in this song alone, there are probably two other verses that always get me.

17685	thats fantastic, GTFO!	I am an official Canadian permanent resident as of this morning. There's not much more to say about it. I just wanted to share because it made me happy. It was a long process and I finally got legally landed after almost 2 years of tedious jumping through hoops, paying through the nose and battling with legal custody issues. Anyway, just one step closer to being Canadian. Next stop? CITIZENSHIP! FULL SAILS AHEAD!
17686	I tell them I'm from the seven_fight_seven	I am from 757 but live in "nova" now for law school. When I was in 757, i hated the "nova" thing too, but once you live here it doesn't really mean as much as I thought people were implying. I honestly think it is overwhelmingly meant to mean: "in the DC area (as it should)", as opposed to "I am rich, well educated, think im better than you, and the rest of Virginia might as well be West Virginia." But then again, I may be wrong, seeing as how I am a transplant...

17690	I would say programming in it is the #1 way, followed by reading how to program in it at a close second.	ask reddit: whats the best way to learn python? I'd like to learn Python using the most concise and effective method but with only general prior programming experience. I am cautious of any method in the style of TAFE.

Is the title of this link somehow implying the Czech Republic is normally viewed as 'less of a country' as compared to the US or the UK?
